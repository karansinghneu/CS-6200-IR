terrestrial planet wikipedia n redirected from terrestrial planetsn jump to navigationnjump to searchn the terrestrial planets of the solar system mercury venus earth and mars sized to scalena terrestrial planet telluric planet or rocky planet is a planet that is composed primarily of silicate rocks or metals within the solar system the terrestrial planets are the inner planets closest to the sun i.e mercury venus earth and mars the terms terrestrial planet and telluric planet are derived from latin words for earth terra and tellus as these planets are in terms of structure earth-like these planets are located between the sun and the asteroid belt.nterrestrial planets have a solid planetary surface making them substantially different from the larger giant planets which are composed mostly of some combination of hydrogen helium and water existing in various physical states.nncontentsnnnstructureeditnall terrestrial planets in the solar system have the same basic type of structure such as a central metallic core mostly iron with a surrounding silicate mantle the moon is similar but has a much smaller iron core io and europa are also satellites that have internal structures similar to that of terrestrial planets terrestrial planets can have canyons craters mountains volcanoes and other surface structures depending on the presence of water and tectonic activity terrestrial planets have secondary atmospheres generated through volcanism or comet impacts in contrast to the giant planets whose atmospheres are primary captured directly from the original solar nebula.nnsolar systems terrestrial planetseditn relative masses of the terrestrial planets of the solar system and the moon shown here as lunan the inner planets sizes to scale clockwise from left rear earth venus mercury mars.nthe solar system has four terrestrial planets mercury venus earth and mars only one terrestrial planet earth is known to have an active hydrosphere.nduring the formation of the solar system there were probably many more terrestrial planetesimals but most merged with or were ejected by the four terrestrial planets.ndwarf planets such as ceres pluto and eris and small solar system bodies are similar to terrestrial planets in the fact that they do have a solid surface but are on average composed of more icy materials ceres pluto and eris have densities of 2.17 1.87 and 2.52 gcm respectively and haumeas density is similar to pallass 2.8 gcm the earths moon has a density of 3.4 gcm and jupiters satellites io 3.528 and europa 3.013 gcm other satellites typically have densities less than 2 gcm.nnndensity trendseditnthe uncompressed density of a terrestrial planet is the average density its materials would have at zero pressure a greater uncompressed density indicates greater metal content uncompressed density differs from the true average density also often called bulk density because compression within planet cores increases their density the average density depends on planet size temperature distribution and material stiffness as well as composition.nnnthe uncompressed density of terrestrial planets trends towards lower values as the distance from the sun increases the rocky minor planet vesta orbiting outside of mars is less dense than mars still at 3.4 gcm.ncalculations to estimate uncompressed density inherently require a model of the planets structure where there have been landers or multiple orbiting spacecraft these models are constrained by seismological data and also moment of inertia data derived from the spacecraft orbits where such data is not available uncertainties are inevitably higher it is unknown whether extrasolar terrestrial planets in general will show to follow this trend.nnextrasolar terrestrial planetseditnsee also super-earth mega-earth and list of nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidatesnmost of the planets discovered outside the solar system are giant planets because they are more easily detectable but since 2005 hundreds of potentially terrestrial extrasolar planets have been found with several being confirmed as terrestrial most of these are super-earths i.e planets with masses between earths and neptunes super-earths may be gas planets or terrestrial depending on their mass and other parameters.nduring the early 1990s the first extrasolar planets were discovered orbiting the pulsar psr b1257+12 with masses of 0.02 4.3 and 3.9 times that of earths by pulsar timing.nwhen 51 pegasi b the first planet found around a star still undergoing fusion was discovered many astronomers assumed it to be a gigantic terrestrial because it was assumed no gas giant could exist as close to its star 0.052 au as 51 pegasi b did it was later found to be a gas giant.nin 2005 the first planets around main-sequence stars that may be terrestrial were found gliese 876 d has a mass 7 to 9 times that of earth and an orbital period of just two earth days it orbits the red dwarf gliese 876 15 light years from earth ogle-2005-blg-390lb about 5.5 times the mass of earth orbits a star about 21,000 light years away in the constellation scorpius.nfrom 2007 to 2010 three possibly four potential terrestrial planets were found orbiting within the gliese 581 planetary system the smallest gliese 581e is only about 1.9 earth mass but orbits very close to the star an ideal terrestrial planet would be 2 earth masses with a 25-day orbital period around a red dwarf two others gliese 581c and gliese 581d as well as a disputed planet gliese 581g are more-massive super-earths orbiting in or close to the habitable zone of the star so they could potentially be habitable with earth-like temperatures.nanother possibly terrestrial planet hd 85512 b was discovered in 2011 it has at least 3.6 times the mass of earth.nthe radius and composition of all these planets are unknown.nn sizes of kepler planet candidates based on 2,740 candidates orbiting 2,036 stars as of november 4 2013 nasa.nthe first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet kepler-10b was found in 2011 by the kepler mission specifically designed to discover earth-size planets around other stars using the transit method.nin the same year the kepler space observatory mission team released a list of 1235 extrasolar planet candidates including six that are earth-size or super-earth-size i.e they have a radius less than 2 earth radii and in the habitable zone of their star.nsince then kepler has discovered hundreds of planets ranging from moon-sized to super-earths with many more candidates in this size range see image.nnlist of terrestrial exoplanetseditnsee also list of nearest terrestrial exoplanet candidatesnthe following exoplanets have a density of at least 5 g/cm and a mass below neptunes and are thus very likely terrestrial:nkepler-10b kepler-20b kepler-36b kepler-48d kepler 68c kepler-78b kepler-89b kepler-93b kepler-97b kepler-99b kepler-100b kepler-101c kepler-102b kepler-102d kepler-113b kepler-131b kepler-131c kepler-138c kepler-406b kepler-406c kepler-409b.nthe neptune-mass planet kepler-10c also has a density 5 g/cm and is thus very likely terrestrial.nnfrequencyeditnin 2013 astronomers reported based on kepler space mission data that there could be as many as 40 billion earth and super-earth-sized planets orbiting in the habitable zones of sun-like stars and red dwarfs within the milky way 11 billion of these estimated planets may be orbiting sun-like stars the nearest such planet may be 12 light-years away according to the scientists however this does not give estimates for the number of extrasolar terrestrial planets because there are planets as small as earth that have been shown to be gas planets see koi-314c.nntypeseditn artists impression of a
