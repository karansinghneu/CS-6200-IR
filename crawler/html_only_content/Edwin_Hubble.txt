hubble november 20 1889 september 28 1953 was an american astronomer he played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology and is regarded as one of the most important astronomers of all time.nhubble discovered that many objects previously thought to be clouds of dust and gas and classified as nebulae were actually galaxies beyond the milky way he used the strong direct relationship between a classical cepheid variables luminosity and pulsation period discovered in 1908 by henrietta swan leavitt for scaling galactic and extragalactic distances.nhubble provided evidence that the recessional velocity of a galaxy increases with its distance from the earth a property now known as hubbles law despite the fact that it had been both proposed and demonstrated observationally two years earlier by georges lematre hubble-lematres law implies that the universe is expanding a decade before the american astronomer vesto slipher had provided the first evidence that the light from many of these nebulae was strongly red-shifted indicative of high recession velocities.nhubbles name is most widely recognized for the hubble space telescope which was named in his honor with a model prominently displayed in his hometown of marshfield missouri.nncontentsnnnbiographyeditnedwin hubble was born to virginia lee hubble ne james 18641934 and john powell hubble an insurance executive in marshfield missouri and moved to wheaton illinois in 1900 in his younger days he was noted more for his athletic prowess than his intellectual abilities although he did earn good grades in every subject except for spelling edwin was a gifted athlete playing baseball football basketball and running track in both high school and college he played a variety of positions on the basketball court from center to shooting guard in fact hubble even led the university of chicagos basketball team to their first conference title in 1907 he won seven first places and a third place in a single high school track and field meet in 1906.nhis studies at the university of chicago were concentrated on law which led to a bachelor of science degree in 1910 hubble also became a member of the kappa sigma fraternity he spent the three years at the queens college oxford after earning his bachelors as one of the universitys first rhodes scholars initially studying jurisprudence instead of science as a promise to his dying father and later added literature and spanish and earning his masters degree.nin 1909 hubbles father moved his family from chicago to shelbyville kentucky so that the family could live in a small town ultimately settling in nearby louisville his father died in the winter of 1913 while edwin was still in england and in the summer of 1913 edwin returned to care for his mother two sisters and younger brother as did his brother william the family moved once more to everett avenue in louisvilles highlands neighborhood to accommodate edwin and william.nhubble was also a dutiful son who despite his intense interest in astronomy since boyhood acquiesced to his fathers request to study law first at the university of chicago and later at oxford though he managed to take a few math and science courses after the death of his father in 1913 edwin returned to the midwest from oxford but did not have the motivation to practice law instead he proceeded to teach spanish physics and mathematics at new albany high school in new albany indiana where he also coached the boys basketball team after a year of high-school teaching he entered graduate school with the help of his former professor from the university of chicago to study astronomy at the universitys yerkes observatory where he received his ph.d in 1917 his dissertation was titled photographic investigations of faint nebulae in yerkes he had access to one of the most powerful telescopes in the world at the time which had an innovative 24 inch 61 cm reflector.nn hubbles identity card in the american expeditionary forces.nafter the united states declared war on germany in 1917 hubble rushed to complete his ph.d dissertation so he could join the military hubble volunteered for the united states army and was assigned to the newly created 86th division where he served in 2nd battalion 343 infantry regiment he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was found fit for overseas duty on july 9 1918 but the 86th division never saw combat after the end of world war i hubble spent a year in cambridge where he renewed his studies of astronomy in 1919 hubble was offered a staff position at the carnegie institution for sciences mount wilson observatory near pasadena california by george ellery hale the founder and director of the observatory hubble remained on staff at mount wilson until his death in 1953 shortly before his death hubble became the first astronomer to use the newly completed giant 200-inch 5.1 m reflector hale telescope at the palomar observatory near san diego california.nhubble also worked as a civilian for u.s army at aberdeen proving ground in maryland during world war ii as the chief of the external ballistics branch of the ballistics research laboratory during which he directed a large volume of research in exterior ballistics which increased the effective firepower of bombs and projectiles his work was facilitated by his personal development of several items of equipment for the instrumentation used in exterior ballistics the most outstanding development being the high-speed clock camera which made possible the study of the characteristics of bombs and low-velocity projectiles in flight the results of his studies were credited with greatly improving design performance and military effectiveness of bombs and rockets for his work there he received the legion of merit award.nhubble was raised as a christian but some of his later statements suggest uncertainty.nhubble married mrs grace lillian burke leib 18891980 daughter of john patrick and luella kepford burke on february 26 1924.nhubble had a heart attack in july 1949 while on vacation in colorado he was taken care of by his wife and continued on a modified diet and work schedule he died of cerebral thrombosis a spontaneous blood clot in his brain on september 28 1953 in san marino california no funeral was held for him and his wife never revealed his burial site.nndiscoverieseditnuniverse goes beyond the milky way galaxyeditn the 100-inch hooker telescope at mount wilson observatory that hubble used to measure galaxy distances and a value for the rate of expansion of the universe.nedwin hubbles arrival at mount wilson observatory california in 1919 coincided roughly with the completion of the 100-inch 2.5 m hooker telescope then the worlds largest at that time the prevailing view of the cosmos was that the universe consisted entirely of the milky way galaxy using the hooker telescope at mt wilson hubble identified cepheid variables a kind of star that is used as a means to determine the distance from the galaxy see also standard candle in several spiral nebulae including the andromeda nebula and triangulum his observations made in 1924 proved conclusively that these nebulae were much too distant to be part of the milky way and were in fact entire galaxies outside our own suspected by researchers at least as early as 1755 when immanuel kants general history of nature and theory of the heavens appeared this idea had been opposed by many in the astronomy establishment of the time in particular by harvard university-based harlow shapley despite the opposition hubble then a thirty-five-year-old scientist had his findings first published in the new york times on november 23 1924 then presented them to other astronomers at the january 1 1925 meeting of the american astronomical society hubbles results for andromeda were not formally published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal until 1929.nn hubbles classification schemenhubbles findings fundamentally changed the scientific view of the universe supporters state that hubbles discovery of nebulae outside of our galaxy helped pave the way for future astronomers although some of his more renowned colleagues simply scoffed at his results hubble ended up publishing his findings on nebulae this published work earned him an award titled the american association prize and five hundred dollars from burton e livingston of the committee on awards.nhubble also devised the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies grouping them according to their appearance in photographic images he arranged the different groups of galaxies in what became known as the hubble sequence.nnredshift increases with distanceeditnhubble went on to estimate the distances to 24 extra-galactic nebulae using a variety of methods in 1929 hubble examined the relation between these distances and their radial velocities as determined from their redshifts his estimated distances are now known to all be too small by up to a factor of about 7 this was due to factors such as the fact that there are two kinds of cepheid variables or confusing bright gas clouds with bright stars however his distances were more or less proportional to the true distances and combining his distances with measurements of the redshifts of the galaxies by vesto slipher and by his assistant milton l humason he found a roughly linear relation between the distances of the galaxies and their radial velocities corrected for solar motion a discovery that later became known as hubbles law.nthis meant the greater the distance between any two galaxies the greater their relative speed of separation if interpreted that way hubbles measurements on 46 galaxies lead to a value for the hubble constant of 500 km/s/mpc which is much higher than the currently accepted value of 70 km/s/mpc due to errors in their distance calibrations.nyet the reason for the redshift remained unclear georges lematre a belgian catholic priest and physicist predicted on theoretical grounds based on einsteins equations for general relativity the redshift-distance relation and published observational support for it two years before the discovery of hubbles law however many cosmologists and astronomers including hubble himself failed to recognize the work of lematre hubble remained doubtful about lematres interpretation for his entire life although he used the term velocities in his paper and apparent radial velocities in the introduction he later expressed doubt about interpreting these as real velocities in 1931 he wrote a letter to the dutch cosmologist willem de sitter expressing his opinion on the theoretical interpretation of the redshift-distance relation:nn"mr humason and i are both deeply sensible of your gracious appreciation of the papers on velocities and distances of nebulae we use the term apparent velocities to emphasize the empirical features of the correlation the interpretation we feel should be left to you and the very few others who are competent to discuss the matter with authority."nntoday the apparent velocities in question are usually thought of as an increase in proper distance that occurs due to the expansion of the universe light traveling through an expanding metric will experience a hubble-type redshift a mechanism somewhat different from the doppler effect although the two mechanisms become equivalent descriptions related by a coordinate transformation for nearby galaxies.nin the 1930s hubble was involved in determining the distribution of galaxies and spatial curvature these data seemed to indicate that the universe was flat and homogeneous but there was a deviation from flatness at large redshifts according to allan sandage,nn"hubble believed that his count data gave a more reasonable result concerning spatial curvature if the redshift correction was made assuming no recession to the very end of his writings he maintained this position favouring or at the very least keeping open the model where no true expansion exists and therefore that the redshift represents a hitherto unrecognized principle of nature."nnthere were methodological problems with hubbles survey technique that showed a deviation from flatness at large redshifts in particular the technique did not account for changes in luminosity of galaxies due to galaxy evolution.nearlier in 1917 albert einstein had found that his newly developed theory of general relativity indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting unable to believe what his own equations were telling him einstein introduced a cosmological constant a fudge factor to the equations to avoid this problem when einstein learned of hubbles redshifts he immediately realized that the expansion predicted by general relativity must be real and in later life he said that changing his equations was the biggest blunder of his life in fact einstein apparently once visited hubble and tried to convince him that the universe was expanding.nhubble also discovered the asteroid 1373 cincinnati on august 30 1935 in 1936 he wrote the observational approach to cosmology and the realm of the nebulae which explained his approaches to extra-galactic astronomy and his view of the subjects history.nin december 1941 hubble reported to the american association for the advancement of science that results from a six-year survey with the mt wilson telescope did not support the expanding universe theory according to an la times article reporting on hubbles remarks the nebulae could not be uniformly distributed as the telescope shows they are and still fit the explosion idea explanations which try to get around what the great telescope sees he said fail to stand up the explosion for example would have had to start long after the earth was created and possibly even after the first life appeared here hubbles estimate of what we now call the hubble constant would put the big bang only 2000 million years ago.nnaccusations concerning lematres priorityeditnin 2011 the journal nature reported claims that hubble had played a role in the redaction of key parts of the translation of lematres 1927 paper which stated what is now called hubbles law and also gave observational evidence for it historians quoted in the article were sceptical that the redactions were part of a campaign to ensure hubble retained priority however the observational astronomer sidney van den bergh published a paper suggesting that while the omissions may have been made by a translator they may still have been deliberate.nin november 2011 the astronomer mario livio reported in nature that documents in the lematre archive demonstrated that the redaction had indeed been carried out by lematre himself who apparently saw little point in including scientific content which had already been reported by hubble.nnno nobel prizeeditnat the time the nobel prize in physics did not recognize work done in astronomy hubble spent much of the later part of his career attempting to have astronomy considered an area of physics instead of being its own science he did this largely so that astronomersincluding himselfcould be recognized by the nobel prize committee for their valuable contributions to astrophysics this campaign was unsuccessful in hubbles lifetime but shortly after his death the nobel prize committee decided that astronomical work would be eligible for the physics prize however the prize is not one that can be awarded posthumously.nnstampeditnon march 6 2008 the united states postal service released a 41-cent stamp honoring hubble on a sheet titled american scientists designed by artist victor stabin his citation reads:nnoften called a pioneer of the distant stars astronomer edwin hubble 18891953 played a pivotal role in deciphering the vast and

nobel prize in physics.nnnote that the assertion that he would have won the nobel prize in 1953 is likely false although he was nominated for the prize that year.nthe other scientists on the american
