southern africa from the time of their emergence while early expansions to eurasia appear not to have persisted expansions to southern and central africa resulted in the deepest temporal divergence in living human populations.nearly modern human expansion in sub-saharan africa appears to contribute to the end of late acheulean fauresmith industries at about 130,000 years ago although very late coexistence of archaic and early modern humans until as late as 12,000 years ago has been argued for west africa in particular.nthe ancestors of the modern khoi-san expanded to southern africa before 150,000 years ago possibly as early as beforen260,000 years ago so that by the beginning of the mis 5 megadrought 130,000 years ago there were two ancestral population clusters in africa bearers of mt-dna haplogroup l0 in southern africa ancestral to the khoi-san and bearers of haplogroup l1-6 in central/eastern africa ancestral to everyone else there was a significant back-migration of bearers of l0 towards eastern africa between 120 and 75 kya.nexpansion to central africa by the ancestors of the central african forager populations african pygmies most likely took place before 130,000 years ago and certainly before 60,000 years ago.nthe situation in west africa is difficult to interpret due to a sparsity of fossil evidence homo sapiens seems to have reached the western sahelian zone by 130 kya while tropical west african sites associated with h sapiens are known only from after 130 kya unlike elsewhere in africa archaic msa sites appear to persist until very late down to the holocene boundary 12 kya pointing to the possibility of late survival of archaic humans and late hybridization with h sapiens in west africa.nnearly northern africa dispersaleditnmain article northern dispersalnfurther information sahara pump theorynpopulations of h sapiens migrated to the levant and to europe between 130,000 and 115,000 years ago and possibly in earlier waves as early as 185,000 years ago.nthese early migrations do not appear to have led to lasting colonisation and receded by about 80,000 years ago.nthere is a possibility that this first wave of expansion may have reached china or even to north america as early as 125,000 years ago but would have died out without leaving a trace in the genome of contemporary humans.nthere is some evidence for the argument that modern humans left africa at least 125,000 years ago using two different routes through the nile valley heading to the middle east at least into modern israel qafzeh 120,000100,000 years ago and a second one through the present-day bab-el-mandeb strait on the red sea at that time with a much lower sea level and narrower extension crossing it into the arabian peninsula settling in places like the present-day united arab emirates 125,000 years ago and oman 106,000 years ago and then possibly going into the indian subcontinent jwalapuram 75,000 years ago despite the fact that no human remains have yet been found in these three places the apparent similarities between the stone tools found at jebel faya the ones from jwalapuram and some african ones suggest that their creators were all modern humans these findings might give some support to the claim that modern humans from africa arrived at southern china about 100,000 years ago zhiren cave zhirendong chongzuo city 100,000 years ago and the liujiang hominid liujiang county controversially dated at 139,000111,000 years ago dating results of the lunadong bubing basin guangxi southern china teeth which include a right upper second molar and a left lower second molar indicate that the molars may be as old as 126,000 years.nsince these previous exits from africa did not leave traces in the results of genetic analyses based on the y chromosome and on mtdna which represent only a small part of the human genetic material it seems that those modern humans did not survive or survived in small numbers and were assimilated by our major antecessors an explanation for their extinction or small genetic imprint may be the toba catastrophe theory 74,000 years ago however some argue that its impact on the human population was not dramatic.nan asia center of origin and dispersal for the mtdna haplogroup l3 has also been hypothesized based on the fossil record the similar coalescence dates of l3 and its eurasian-distributed m and n derivative clades 71 kya the distant location in southeast asia of the oldest subclades of m and n and the comparable age of the paternal haplogroup de after an initial out-of-africa migration of early anatomically modern humans around 125 kya fully modern human l3-carrying females are thus proposed to have back-migrated from the maternal haplogroups place of origin in eurasia around 70 kya along with males bearing the paternal haplogroup e which is also thought to have originated in eurasia these new eurasian lineages are then suggested to have largely replaced the old autochthonous male and female african lineages.nncoastal migrationeditnmain article coastal migrationnfurther information recent african origin of modern humans archaic human admixture with modern humans and

be associated with the modern human jawbone finds.nalong the way h sapiens interbred with neanderthals and denisovans with denisovan dna making 0.2 of mainland asian and native american dna.nnoceaniaeditnmigrations continued along the asian coast to southeast asia and oceania colonising australia before 50,000 years ago.nby reaching australia h sapiens for the first time expanded its habitat beyond that of h erectus.ndenisovan ancestry is shared by melanesians australian aborigines and smaller scattered groups of people in southeast asia such as the mamanwa a negrito people in the philippines suggesting the interbreeding took place in eastern asia where the denisovans lived denisovans may have crossed the wallace line with wallacea serving as their last refugium homo erectus crossed the lombok gap reaching as far as flores but never made it to australia.nn the map shows the probable extent of land and water at the time of the last glacial maximum 20,000 yrs ago and when the sea level was probably more than 110m lower than today.nduring this time sea level was much lower and most of maritime southeast asia formed one land mass known as sunda migration continued southeast on the coastal route to the straits between sunda and sahul the continental land mass of present-day australia and new guinea the gaps on the weber line are up to 90 km wide so the migration to australia and new guinea would have required seafaring skills migration also continued along the coast eventually turning northeast to china and finally reaching japan before turning inland this is evidenced by the pattern of mitochondrial haplogroups descended from haplogroup m and in y-chromosome haplogroup c.nsequencing of one aboriginal genome from an old hair sample in western australia revealed that the individual was descended from people who migrated into east asia between 62,000 and 75,000 years ago this supports the theory of a single migration into australia and new guinea before the arrival of modern asians between 25,000 and 38,000 years ago and their later migration into north america this migration is believed to have happened around 50,000 years ago before australia and new guinea were separated by rising sea levels approximately 8,000 years ago this is supported by a date of 50,00060,000 years ago for the oldest evidence of settlement in australia around 40,000 years ago for the oldest human remains the earliest humans artifacts which are at least 65,000 years old and the extinction of the australian megafauna by humans between 46,000 and 15,000 years ago argued by tim flannery which is similar to what happened in the americas the continued use of stone age tools in australia has been much debated.nndispersal throughout

place before modern humans entered europe.nthere is evidence from mitochondrial dna that modern humans have passed through at least one genetic bottleneck in which genome diversity was drastically reduced henry harpending has proposed that humans spread from a geographically restricted area about 100,000 years ago the passage through the geographic bottleneck and then with a dramatic growth amongst geographically dispersed populations about 50,000 years ago beginning first in africa and thence spreading elsewhere nclimatological and geological evidence suggests evidence for the bottleneck the explosion of lake toba created a 1,000 year cold period as a result of the largest volcanic eruption of the quaternary potentially reducing human populations to a few tropical refugia it has been estimated that as few as 15,000 humans survived in such circumstances genetic drift and founder effects may have been maximised the greater diversity amongst african genomes may be in part due to the greater prevalence of african refugia during the toba incident however a recent review highlights that the single-source hypothesis of non-african populations is less supported by ancient dna analysis than multiple sources plus genetic mixing across eurasia.nneuropeeditnmain articles european early modern humans aurignacian gravettian and art of the upper paleolithicnfurther

years ago and may have taken 15,00020,000 years for europe to be colonized.nduring this time the neanderthals were slowly being displaced because it took so long for europe to be occupied it appears that humans and neanderthals may have been constantly competing for territory the neanderthals had larger brains and were larger overall with a more robust or heavily built frame which suggests that they were physically stronger than modern homo sapiens having lived in europe for 200,000 years they would have been better adapted to the cold weather the anatomically modern humans known as the cro-magnons with widespread trade networks superior technology and bodies likely better suited to running would eventually completely displace the neanderthals whose last refuge was in the iberian peninsula after about 25,000 years ago the fossil record of the neanderthals ends indicating that they had become extinct the last known population lived around a cave system on the remote south-facing coast of gibraltar from 30,000 to 24,000 years ago.nfrom the extent of linkage disequilibrium it was estimated that the last neanderthal gene flow into early ancestors of europeans occurred 47,00065,000 years bp in conjunction with archaeological and fossil evidence the gene flow is thought likely to have occurred somewhere in western eurasia possibly the middle east studies show a higher neanderthal admixture in east asians than in europeans north african groups share a similar excess of derived alleles with neanderthals as do non-african populations whereas sub-saharan african groups are the only modern human populations that generally did not experience neanderthal admixture the neanderthal-linked haplotype b006 of the dystrophin gene has also been found among nomad pastoralist groups in the sahel and horn of africa who are associated with northern populations consequently the presence of this b006 haplotype on the northern and northeastern perimeter of sub-saharan africa is attributed to gene flow from a non-african point of origin.nneast and north asiaeditnfurther information mongoloid genetic_researchn"tianyuan man an individual who lived in china
