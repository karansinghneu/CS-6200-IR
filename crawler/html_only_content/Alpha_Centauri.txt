closest planetary system to the solar system at 4.37 light-years 1.34 pc from the sun it is a triple star system consisting of three stars centauri a officially rigil kentaurus centauri b officially toliman and centauri c officially proxima centauri.nalpha centauri a and b are sun-like stars class g and k and together they form the binary star alpha centauri ab to the naked eye the two main components appear to be a single star with an apparent magnitude of 0.27 forming the brightest star in the southern constellation of centaurus and the third-brightest in the night sky outshone only by sirius and canopus.nalpha centauri a has 1.1 times the mass and 1.519 times the luminosity of the sun while alpha centauri b is smaller and cooler at 0.907 times the suns mass and 0.445 times its luminosity the pair orbit about a common centre with an orbital period of 79.91 years their elliptical orbit is eccentric so that the distance between a and b varies from 35.6 astronomical units au to that between saturn and the sun 11.2 au.nalpha centauri c or proxima centauri is a small and faint red dwarf class m though not visible to the naked eye proxima centauri is the closest star to the sun at a distance of 4.24 light-years 1.30 pc slightly closer than alpha centauri ab currently the distance between proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab is about 13,000 astronomical units 0.21 ly equivalent to about 430 times the radius of neptunes orbit proxima centauri b is an earth-sized exoplanet in the habitable zone of proxima centauri it was discovered in 2016.nncontentsnnnnomenclatureeditn centauri latinized to alpha centauri is the systems bayer designation it once bore the name rigil kentaurus which is a latinisation of the arabic name rijl al-qanris meaning foot of the centaur.nalpha centauri c was discovered in 1915 by robert t a innes who suggested that it be named proxima centaurus later amended to proxima centauri the name is from latin meaning nearest star of centaurus.nin 2016 the working group on star names of the international astronomical union having decided to attribute proper names to individual stars rather than entire multiple systems approved the names rigil kentaurus for alpha centauri a and proxima centauri for alpha centauri c in 10 august 2018 iau approved the name toliman for alpha centauri b.nnstellar systemeditnalpha centauri is a triple star system with its two main stars alpha centauri a and alpha centauri b being a binary component the ab designation or older ab denotes the mass centre of a main binary system relative to companion stars in a multiple star system ab-c refers to the component of proxima centauri in relation to the central binary being the distance between the centre of mass and the outlying companion because the distance between proxima c and either of alpha centauri a or b is similar the ab binary system is sometimes treated as a single gravitational object.nnorbital propertieseditn apparent and true orbits of alpha centauri the a component is held stationary and the relative orbital motion of the b component is shown the apparent orbit thin ellipse is the shape of the orbit as seen by an observer on earth the true orbit is the shape of the orbit viewed perpendicular to the plane of the orbital motion according to the radial velocity vs time the radial separation of a and b along the line of sight had reached a maximum in 2007 with b being further from earth than a the orbit is divided here into 80 points each step refers to a timestep of approx 0.99888 years or 364.84 days.nthe a and b components of alpha centauri have an orbital period of 79.91 years their orbit is moderately eccentric e 0.5179 their closest approach is 11.2 au 1.68 billion km or about the distance between the sun and saturn and their furthest separation is 35.6 au 5.33 billion km about the distance between the sun and pluto.nviewed from earth the apparent orbit of a and b means that their separation and position angle pa are in continuous change throughout their projected orbit the closest recent approach was in february 2016 at 4.0 arcsec through the pa of 300 the observed maximum separation of these stars is about 22 arcsec while the minimum distance is 1.7 arcsec the widest separation occurred during february 1976 and the next will be in january 2056.nthe most recent true orbit closest approach or periastron was in august 1955 and the next will be in may 2035 the furthest orbital separation or apastron last occurred in may 1995 and the next will be in 2075 the apparent distance between alpha centauri a and b is rapidly decreasing at least until 2019.nalpha centauri c is about 13,000 astronomical units au away from alpha centauri ab this is equivalent to 0.21 ly or 1.9 trillion kmabout 5 the distance between alpha centauri ab and the sun for a long time estimates of proximas small orbital speed around ab were insufficiently accurate to determine whether proxima centauri is bound to the alpha centauri system or an unrelated star that happens to be passing by at a low speed.nradial velocity measurements made in 2017 were precise enough to show that proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab are gravitationally bound the orbital period of proxima centauri is approximately 7005547000000000000547000+66004000 years with an eccentricity of 0.50 0.08 more eccentric than mercurys proxima centauri comes within 70146432708440100004300+1100900 au of ab at periastron and the apastron occurs at 701519447723191000013000+300100 au.nnphysical propertieseditn the relative sizes and colours of stars in the alpha centauri system compared to the sunnasteroseismic studies chromospheric activity and stellar rotation gyrochronology are all consistent with the alpha centauri system being similar in age to or slightly older than the sun asteroseismic analyses that incorporate tight observational constraints on the stellar parameters for the alpha centauri stars have yielded age estimates of 70004849999999999994.850.5 gyr 70005000000000000005.00.5 gyr 5.2 1.9 gyr 6.4 gyr and 70006520000000000006.520.3 gyr age estimates for the stars based on chromospheric activity calcium h k emission yield 4.4 2.1 gyr whereas gyrochronology yields 70005000000000000005.00.3 gyr stellar evolution theory implies both stars are slightly older than the sun at 5 to 6 billion years as derived by their mass and spectral characteristics.nfrom the orbital elements the total mass of alpha centauri ab is about 2.0 mor twice that of the sun the average individual stellar masses are 1.09 m and 0.90 m respectively though slightly higher masses have been quoted in recent years such as 1.14 m and 0.92 m or totalling 2.06 m alpha centauri a and b have absolute magnitudes of 4.38 and 5.71 respectively nnalpha centauri aeditnalpha centauri a also known as rigil kentaurus is the principal member or primary of the binary system it is a solar-like main-sequence star with a similar yellowish colour whose stellar classification is spectral type g2 v it is slightly larger and more luminous than the sun alpha centauri a is about 10 percent more massive than the sun with a radius about 22 percent larger when considered among the individual brightest stars in the sky excluding the sun it is the fourth brightest at an apparent magnitude of 0.01 being slightly fainter than arcturus at an apparent magnitude of 0.04.nthe type of magnetic activity on alpha centauri a is comparable to that of the sun showing coronal variability due to star spots as modulated by the rotation of the star however since 2005 the activity level has fallen into a deep minimum that might be similar to the suns historical maunder minimum alternatively it may have a very long stellar activity cycle and is slowly recovering from a minimum phase.nnalpha centauri beditnalpha centauri b also known as toliman is the secondary star of the binary system it is a main-sequence star of spectral type k1 v making it more an orange colour than alpha centauri a it has around 90 percent the mass of the sun and a 14 percent smaller diameter although it has a lower luminosity than a alpha centauri b emits more energy in the x-ray band its light curve varies on a short time scale and there has been at least one observed flare it is more magnetically active than alpha centauri a showing a cycle of 70082587723199999998.20.2 yr compared to 11 years for the sun and about half the minimum-to-peak variation in coronal luminosity of the sun alpha centauri b has an apparent magnitude of 1.35 slightly dimmer than beta crucis.nnalpha centauri ceditnmain article proxima centaurinalpha centauri c better known as proxima centauri is a small main-sequence red dwarf of spectral class m6 ve it has an absolute magnitude of 15.60 over 20,000 times fainter than the sun its mass is calculated to be 69991221000000000000.1221 m.nn relative positions of sun alpha centauri ab and proxima centauri grey dot is projection of proxima centauri located at the same distance as alpha centauri

bright stars of the southern cross just to the right of the dome of la silla observatory.nto the naked eye alpha centauri ab appears to be a single star the brightest in the southern constellation of centaurus their apparent angular separation varies over about 80 years between 2 and 22 arcsec the naked eye has a resolution of 60 arcsec but through much of the orbit both are easily resolved in binoculars or small telescopes at 0.27 apparent magnitude combined for a and b magnitudes alpha centauri is fainter only than sirius and canopus it forms the outer star of the pointers or the southern pointers so called because the line through beta centauri hadar/agena,nsome 4.5 west points to the constellation cruxthe southern cross the pointers easily distinguish the true southern cross from the fainter asterism known as the false cross.nn alpha centauri ab taken in daylight by holding a canon powershot s100 behind the eyepiece of a 110 mm refractor the photo is one of the best frames of a video the double star is clearly visible.nsouth of about 29 s latitude alpha centauri is circumpolar and never sets below the horizon north of about 29 n latitude alpha centauri never rises alpha centauri lies close to the southern horizon when viewed from the 29 n latitude to the equator close to hermosillo chihuahua city in mexico galveston texas ocala florida and lanzarote the canary islands of spain but only for a short time around its culmination the star culminates each year at local midnight on 24 april and at local 9 p.m on 8 june.nas seen from earth proxima centauri is 2.2 southwest from alpha centauri ab about four times the angular diameter of the moon proxima centauri appears as a deep-red star of a typical apparent magnitude of 11.1 in a sparsely populated star field requiring moderately sized telescopes to be seen listed as v645 cen in the general catalogue of variable stars version 4.2 this uv ceti-type flare star can unexpectedly brighten rapidly by as much as 0.6 magnitudes at visual wavelengths then fade after only a few minutes some amateur and professional astronomers regularly monitor for outbursts using either optical or radio telescopes in august 2015 the largest recorded flares of the star occurred with the star becoming 8.3 times brighter than normal on 13 august in the b band blue light region.nnobservational historyeditn view of alpha centauri from the digitized sky survey 2nalpha centauri is listed in the 2nd-century star catalog of ptolemy he gave its ecliptic coordinates but texts differ as to whether the ecliptic latitude reads 44 10 south or 41 10 south presently the ecliptic latitude is 43.5 south but it has decreased by a fraction of a degree since ptolemys time due to proper motion in ptolemys time alpha centauri was visible from alexandria egypt at 31 n but due to precession its declination is now 60 51 south and it can no longer be seen at that latitude english explorer robert hues brought alpha centauri to the attention of european observers in his 1592 work tractatus de globis along with canopus and achernar noting:"now therefore there are but three stars of the first magnitude that i could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in england the first of these is that bright star in the sterne of argo which they call canobus the second achernar is in the end of eridanus the third alpha centauri is in the right foote of the centaure."the binary nature of alpha centauri ab was recognised in december 1689 by jean richaud while observing a passing comet from his station in puducherry alpha centauri was only the second binary star to be discovered preceded by alpha crucis.nthe large proper motion of alpha centauri ab was discovered by manuel john johnson observing from saint helena who informed thomas henderson at the royal observatory cape of good hope of it the parallax of alpha centauri was subsequently determined by henderson from many exacting positional observations of the ab system between april 1832 and may 1833 he withheld his results however because he suspected they were too large to be true but eventually published them in 1839 after friedrich wilhelm bessel released his own accurately determined parallax for 61 cygni in 1838 for this reason alpha centauri is sometimes considered as the second star to have its distance measured because hendersons work was not fully acknowledged at first the distance of alpha centauri from the earth is now reckoned at 4.396 ly or 41.59 trillion km.nn compared to the sun alpha centauri a is of the same stellar type g2 while alpha centauri b is a k1-type star.nlater john herschel made the first micrometrical observations in 1834 since the early 20th century measures have been made with photographic plates.nby 1926 william stephen finsen calculated the approximate orbit elements close to those now accepted for this system all future positions are now sufficiently accurate for visual observers to determine the relative places of the stars from a binary star ephemeris others like d pourbaix 2002 have regularly refined the precision of new published orbital elements.nrobert t a innes discovered proxima centauri in 1915 by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a proper motion survey these showed large proper motion and parallax similar in both size and direction to those of alpha centauri ab suggesting that proxima centauri is part of the alpha centauri system and slightly closer to earth than alpha centauri ab lying 4.24 ly 1.30 pc away proxima centauri is the nearest star to the sun.nnkinematicseditn stars closest to the sun including alpha centauri 25 april 2014nall components of alpha centauri display significant proper motion against the background sky over centuries this causes their apparent positions to slowly change proper motion was unknown to ancient astronomers most assumed that the stars are immortal and permanently fixed on the celestial sphere as stated in the works of the philosopher aristotle in 1718 edmond halley found that some stars had significantly moved from their ancient astrometric positions.nin the 1830s thomas henderson discovered the true distance to alpha centauri by analysing his many astrometric mural circle observations he then realised this system also likely had a high proper motion in this case the apparent stellar motion was found using nicolas louis de lacailles astrometric observations of 17511752 by the observed differences between the two measured positions in different epochs.ncalculated proper motion of the centre of mass for alpha centauri ab is about 3620 mas milli-arcseconds per year toward the west and 694 mas/y toward the north giving an overall motion of 3686 mas/y in a direction 11 north of west the motion of the centre of mass is about 6.1 arcmin each century or 1.02 each millennium the velocity in the western direction is 23.0 km/s and in the northerly direction 4.4 km/s using spectroscopy the mean radial velocity has been determined to be around 22.4 km/s towards the solar system.nsince alpha centauri ab is almost exactly in the plane of the milky way as viewed from earth there are many stars behind them in early may 2028 alpha centauri a will pass between us and a distant red star when there will be a 45 probability that an einstein ring will be observed other conjunctions will also occur in the coming decades allowing accurate measurement of proper motions and possibly giving information on planets.nnpredicted future changeseditn distances of the nearest stars from 20,000 years ago until 80,000 years in the futuren animation showing motion of alpha centauri through the sky the other stars are held fixed for didactic reasons oggi means today.nas the stars of alpha centauri move closer to the solar system their measured proper motions trigonometric parallaxes and radial velocities slowly increase.nthese effects will continue until the star system reaches its nearest point to the sun and then reverse as the distance increases again furthermore other small changes also occur with the binary stars orbital elements for example in the apparent size of the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse will increase by 0.03 arcsec per century also the observed position angles of the stars are also subject to small cumulative changes additional to position angle changes caused by the precession of the equinoxes as first determined by w h van den bos in 1926.nn apparent motion of alpha centauri relative to centauri the minimum separation will actually be greater than shown in this figure.nbased on the systems common known proper motion and radial velocities alpha centauri will continue to change its position in the sky significantly and will gradually brighten for example in about 6,200 ad centauris true motion will cause an extremely rare first-magnitude stellar conjunction with centauri forming a brilliant optical double star in the southern sky it will then pass just north of the southern cross or crux before moving northwest and up towards the present celestial equator and away from the galactic plane by about 29,700 ad in the present-day constellation of hydra alpha centauri will be 1.00 pc or 3.3 ly away though later calculations suggest 0.90 pc or 2.9 ly in 29,000 ad at nearest approach alpha centauri will attain a maximum apparent magnitude of 0.86 comparable to present-day magnitude of canopus but it will still not surpass that of sirius which will brighten incrementally over the next 60,000 years and will continue to be the brightest star as seen from earth other than the sun for the next 210,000 years.nabout 28,000 years from now the alpha centauri system will begin to slowly move away from the solar system and this bright yellow star will eventually fall below naked-eye visibility.nnplanetary systemeditnconfirmed planetseditnmain article proxima centauri bnonly one planet has been confirmed for the alpha centauri system proxima centauri b it is slightly larger than the earth and orbits around proxima centauri in the habitable zone the existence of proxima centauri b was announced in 2016 by the european southern observatory it was found using the radial velocity method where periodic doppler shifts of spectral lines of the host star suggest an orbiting object.nncontroversial and hypothetical planetseditnalpha centauri bbeditnmain article alpha centauri bbnin 2012 a planet around alpha centauri b was announced alpha centauri bb but in 2015 a new analysis concluded that it almost certainly does not exist and was just a spurious artefact of the data analysis.nnalpha centauri bceditnthe existence of a planet alpha centauri bc was announced in 2013 it has an estimated orbital period of approximately 12 earth days less than that of mercury with a semimajor axis of 0.10 au and an eccentricity smaller than 0.24.nin 2015 transit results for alpha centauri b obtained using the hubble space telescope were published they evidence a transit event possibly corresponding to a planetary body with a radius around 0.92 r this planet would most likely orbit alpha centauri b with an orbital period of 20.4 days or less with only a 5 percent chance of it having a longer orbit the median of the likely orbits is 12.4 days with an impact parameter of around 00.3 its orbit would likely have an eccentricity of 0.24 or less like the probably spurious alpha centauri bb it likely has lakes of molten lava and would be far too close to alpha centauri b to harbour life.nnhypothetical planetseditnadditional planets may exist in the alpha centauri system either orbiting alpha centauri a or alpha centauri b individually or in large orbits around alpha centauri ab because both stars are fairly similar to the sun for example in age and metallicity astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the alpha centauri system several established planet-hunting teams have used various radial velocity or star transit methods in their searches around these two bright stars all the observational studies have so far failed to find evidence for brown dwarfs or gas giants.nin 2009 computer simulations showed that a planet might have been able to form near the inner edge of alpha centauri bs habitable zone which extends from 0.5 to 0.9 au from the star certain special assumptions such as considering that the alpha centauri pair may have initially formed with a wider separation and later moved closer to each other as might be possible if they formed in a dense star cluster would permit an accretion-friendly environment farther from the star bodies around alpha centauri a would be able to orbit at slightly farther distances due to its stronger gravity in addition the lack of any brown dwarfs or gas giants in close orbits around alpha centauri make the likelihood of terrestrial planets greater than otherwise a theoretical study indicates that a radial velocity analysis might detect a hypothetical planet of 1.8 m in alpha centauri bs habitable zone.nradial velocity measurements of alpha centauri b with high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher spectrograph ruled out planets of more than 4 m to the distance of the habitable zone of the star orbital period p 200 days.ncurrent estimates place the probability of finding an earth-like planet around alpha centauri at roughly 85 the observational thresholds for planet detection in the habitable zones by the radial velocity method are currently 2017 estimated to be about 50 m for alpha centauri a 8 m for alpha centauri b and 0.5 m for proxima centauri.nearly computer-generated models of planetary formation predicted the existence of terrestrial planets around both alpha centauri a and b but most recent numerical investigations have shown that the gravitational pull of the companion star renders the accretion of planets difficult despite these difficulties given the similarities to the sun in spectral types star type age and probable stability of the orbits it has been suggested that this stellar system could hold one of the best possibilities for harbouring extraterrestrial life on a potential planet.nin the solar system jupiter and saturn were probably crucial in perturbing comets into the inner solar system providing the inner planets with a source of water and various other ices in the alpha centauri system proxima centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the alpha centauri system was forming enriching the area around alpha centauri with volatile materials this would be discounted if for example alpha centauri b happened to have gas giants orbiting alpha centauri a or conversely alpha centauri a for alpha centauri b or if alpha centauri a and b themselves were able to perturb comets into each others inner system as jupiter and saturn presumably have done in the solar system such icy bodies probably also reside in oort clouds of other planetary systems when they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars many of these icy bodies then travel starwards such ideas also apply to the close approach of alpha centauri or other stars to the solar system when in the distant future the oort cloud might be disrupted enough to increase the number of active comets.nto be in the habitable zone a planet around alpha centauri a would have an orbital radius of about 1.25 au so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist for the slightly less luminous and cooler alpha centauri b the habitable zone is closer at about 0.7 au 100 million km.nwith the goal of finding evidence of such planets both proxima centauri and alpha centauri ab were among the listed tier 1 target stars for nasas space interferometry mission sim detecting planets as small as three earth-masses or smaller within two astronomical units of a tier 1 target would have been possible with this new instrument the sim mission however was cancelled due to financial issues in 2010.nncircumstellar discseditnbased on observations between 2007 and 2012 a study found a slight excess of emissions in the 24 m mid/far-infrared band surrounding centauri ab which may be interpreted as evidence for a sparse circumstellar disc or dense interplanetary dust the total mass was estimated to be between 10 to 10 the mass of the moon or 10100 times the mass of the solar systems zodiacal cloud if such a disc existed around both stars centauri as disc would likely be stable to 2.8 au and centauri bs would likely be stable to 2.5 au this would put as disc entirely within the frost line and a small part of bs outer disc just outside.nnview from this systemeditn looking towards the sky around orion from alpha centauri with sirius near betelgeuse procyon in gemini and the sun in cassiopeia generated by celestian the sun in the constellation cassiopeia as seen from alpha centaurinthe sky from alpha centauri ab would appear much as it does from the earth except that centaurus would be missing its brightest star the
