yuezhi wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnnthe yuezhi chinese pinyin yuzh wadegiles yeh-chih e were an ancient indo-european people first described in chinese histories as nomadic pastoralists living in an arid grassland area in the western part of the modern chinese province of gansu during the 1st millennium bc after a major defeat by the xiongnu in 176 bc the yuezhi split into two groups migrating in different directions the greater yuezhi d yuzh and lesser yuezhi xio yuzh nthe greater yuezhi initially migrated northwest into the ili valley on the modern borders of china and kazakhstan where they reportedly displaced elements of the sakas they were driven from the ili valley by the wusun and migrated southward to sogdia and later settled in bactria where they then defeated the greco-bactrian kingdom the greater yuezhi have consequently often been identified with bactrian peoples mentioned in classical european sources like the tkharioi greek sanskrit tukhra and asii or asioi during the 1st century bc one of the five major greater yuezhi tribes in bactria the kushanas chinese pinyin gushung began to subsume the other tribes and neighbouring peoples the subsequent kushan empire at its peak in the 3rd century ce stretched from turfan in the tarim basin in the north to pataliputra on the gangetic plain of india in the south the kushanas played an important role in the development of trade on the silk road and the introduction of buddhism to china.nthe lesser yuezhi migrated southward to the edge of the tibetan plateau some are reported to have settled among the qiang people in qinghai and to have been involved in the liangzhou rebellion 184221 ce others are said to have founded the city state of cumua now known as kumul and hami in the eastern tarim a fourth group of lesser yuezhi may have become part of the jie people of shanxi who established the 4th century ad later zhao state although this remains controversial.nalthough some scholars have associated the yuezhi with artifacts of extinct cultures in the tarim basin such as the tarim mummies and texts recording the tocharian languages the evidence for any such link is purely circumstantial.nnncontentsnnnearliest references in chinese textseditn by the 3rd century bc the yuezhi resided to the northwest of qin china.nthree pre-han texts mention peoples who appear to be the yuezhi albeit under slightly different names.nnnin the 1st century bc sima qian widely regarded as the founder of chinese historiography describes how the qin dynasty 221206 bc bought jade and highly valued military horses from a people that sima qian called the wzh oc a-kje led by a man named as luo the wzh traded these goods for chinese silk which they then sold on to other neighbours this is probably the first reference to the yuezhi as a lynchpin in trade on the silk road which in the 3rd century bc began to link chinese states to central asia and eventually the middle east the mediterranean and europe.nnaccount of zhang qianeditnthe earliest detailed account of the yuezhi is found in chapter 123 of the records of the great historian by sima qian describing a mission of zhang qian in the late 2nd century bc essentially the same text appears in chapter 61 of the book of han though sima qian has added occasional words and phrases to clarify the meaning.nboth texts use the name yuzh oc jat-kje composed of characters meaning moon and clan respectively several different romanizations of this chinese-language name have appeared in print the iranologist h w bailey preferred e-i another modern chinese pronunciation of the name is ruzh based on the theory that the character in the name is a scribal error for nnyuezhi and xiongnueditnthe account begins with the yuezhi occupying the grasslands to the northwest of china at the beginning of the 2nd century bc:nnthe great yuezhi was a nomadic horde they moved about following their cattle and had the same customs as those of the xiongnu as their soldiers numbered more than hundred thousand they were strong and despised the xiongnu in the past they lived in the region between dunhuang and qilian book of han 61nnthe area between the qilian mountains and dunhuang lies in the western part of the modern chinese province of gansu but no archaeological remains of the yuezhi have yet been found in this area.nsome scholars have argued that dunhuang should be dunhong a mountain in the tian shan and that qilian should be interpreted as a name for the tian shan they have thus placed the original homeland of the yuezhi 1,000 km further northwest in the grasslands to the north of the tian shan in the northern part of modern xinjiang.nother authors suggest that the area identified by sima qian was merely the core area of an empire encompassing the western part of the mongolian plain the upper reaches of the yellow river the tarim basin and possibly much of central asia including the altai mountains the site of the pazyryk burials of the ukok plateau.nby the late 3rd century the yuezhi were so powerful that the xiongnu monarch touman even sent his eldest son modu as a hostage to the yuezhi the yuezhi often attacked their neighbour the wusun to acquire slaves and pasture lands wusun originally lived together with the yuezhi in the region between dunhuang and qilian mountain the yuezhi attacked the wusuns killed their monarch nandoumi and took his territory the son of nandoumi kunmo fled to the xiongnu and was brought up by the xiongnu monarch.ngradually the xiongnu grew stronger and war broke out between them and the yuezhi there were at least four wars between the yuezhi and xiongnu according to the chinese accounts the first war broke out during the reign of the xiongnu monarch touman who died in 209 b.c who suddenly attacked the yuezhi the yuezhi wanted to kill modu the son of the xiongnu king touman kept as a hostage to them but modu stole a good horse from them and managed to escape to his country he subsequently killed his father and became ruler of the xiongnu it appears that the xiongnu did not defeat the yuezhi in this first war the second war took place in the 7th year of modu era 203 b.c from this war a large area of the territory originally belonging to the yuezhi was seized by the xiongnu and the hegemony of the yuezhi started to shake the third war probably was at 176 bc or shortly earlier and the yuezhi were badly defeated.nshortly before 176 bc led by one of modus tribal chiefs the xiongnu invaded yuezhi territory in the gansu region and achieved a crushing victory modu boasted in a letter 174 bc to the han emperor that due to the excellence of his fighting men and the strength of his horses he has succeeded in wiping out the yuezhi slaughtering or forcing to submission every number of the tribe the son of modu laoshang chanyu ruled 174166 bc subsequently killed the king of the yuezhi and in accordance with nomadic traditions made a drinking cup out of his skull shiji 123.nnevertheless in about 173 bc the wusun were apparently defeated by the yuezhi who killed a wusun king kunmi chinese or kunmo chinese known as nandoumi chinese nnexodus of the great yuezhieditn central asia in the 1st century bcenafter their defeat by the xiongnu the yuezhi split into two groups the lesser or little yuezhi xiao yuezhi moved to the southern mountains believed to be the qilian mountains on the edge of the tibetan plateau to live with the qiang.nthe so-called greater or great yuezhi da yuezhi began migrating north-west in about 165 bc first settling in the ili valley immediately north of the tian shan mountains where they defeated the sai sakas the yuezhi attacked the king of the sai who moved a considerable distance to the south and the yuezhi then occupied his lands book of han 61 4b this was the first historically recorded movement of peoples originating in the high plateaus of asia."nin 132 bc the wusun in alliance with the xiongnu and out of revenge from an earlier conflict again managed to dislodge the yuezhi from the ili valley forcing them to move south-west the yuezhi passed through the neighbouring urban civilization of dayuan in ferghana and settled on the northern bank of the oxus in the region of northern bactria or transoxiana modern tajikistan and uzbekistan.nnvisit of zhang qianeditn a later mural c 618712 ce from the mogao caves depicting the chinese mission of zhang qian to the yuezhi in 126 bc.nthe yuezhi were visited in transoxiana by a chinese mission led by zhang qian in 126 bc which sought an offensive alliance with the yuezhi against the xiongnu zhang qian who spent a year in transoxiana and bactria wrote a detailed account in the shiji which gives considerable insight into the situation in central asia at the time the request for an alliance was denied by the son of the slain yuezhi king who preferred to maintain peace in transoxiana rather than seek revenge.nzhang qian also reported:nnthe great yuezhi live 2,000 or 3,000 li 8321,247 kilometers west of dayuan north of the gui oxus river they are bordered on the south by daxia bactria on the west by anxi parthia and on the north by kangju beyond the middle jaxartes/syr darya they are a nation of nomads moving from place to place with their herds and their customs are like those of the xiongnu they have some 100,000 or 200,000 archer warriors shiji 123nnin a sweeping analysis of the physical types and cultures of central asia zhang qian reports:nnalthough the states from dayuan west to anxi parthia speak rather different languages their customs are generally similar and their languages mutually intelligible the men have deep-set eyes and profuse beards and whiskers they are skilful at commerce and will haggle over a fraction of a cent women are held in great respect and the men make decisions on the advice of their women shiji 123nn watershed of the oxus river modern amu daryanzhang qian also described the remnants of the greco-bactrian kingdom on the other side of the oxus river chinese gui as a number of autonomous city-states under yuezhi suzerainty:nndaxia is located over 2,000 li southwest of dayuan south of the gui river its people cultivate the land and have cities and houses their customs are like those of ta-yuan it has no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities the people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle but they are clever at commerce after the great yuezhi moved west and attacked the lands the entire country came under their sway the population of the country is large numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons the capital is called the city of lanshi and has a market where all sorts of goods are bought and sold shiji 123nnlater chinese accountseditnthe next mention of the yuezhi in chinese sources is found in chapter 96a of the book of han completed in 111 ce relating to the early 1st century bc at this time the yuezhi are described as occupying the whole of bactria organized into five major tribes or xhu ch allied prince".nthese tribes were known to the chinese as:nnnthe book of the later han 5th century ce also records the visit of yuezhi envoys to the chinese capital in 2 bc who gave oral teachings on buddhist sutras to a student suggesting that some yuezhi already followed the buddhist faith during the 1st century bc baldev kumar 1973.nchapter 88 of the book of the later han relies on a report of ban yong based on the campaigns of his father ban chao in the late 1st century ce it reports that one of the five tribes of the yuezhi the guishuang had managed to take control of the tribal confederation:nnmore than a hundred years later the xihou of guishuang named qiujiu que ch kujula kadphises attacked and exterminated the four other xihou he set himself up as king of a kingdom called guishuang kushan he invaded anxi parthia and took the gaofu ch kabul

became king in his place he returned and defeated tianzhu northwestern india and installed a general to supervise and lead it the yuezhi then became extremely rich all the kingdoms call their king the

strange things from the southern region a now-lost 3rd-century text from the wu kingdom describes the kushans as living in the same general area north of india in cities of greco-roman style and with sophisticated handicraft the quotes are dubious as wan zhen probably never visited the yuezhi kingdom through the silk road though he might have gathered his information from the trading ports in the coastal south chinese sources continued to use the name yuezhi and seldom used the kushan or guishuang as a generic term:nnthe great yuezhi are located about seven thousand li 2,910 km north of india their land is at a high altitude the climate is dry the region is remote the king of the state calls himself son of heaven there are so many riding horses in that country that the number often reaches several hundred thousand city layouts and palaces are quite similar to those of daqin the roman empire the skin of the people there is reddish white people are skilful at horse archery local products rarities treasures clothing and upholstery are very good and even india cannot compare with it wan zhen 3rd century cennkushanaeditn a bust of a man c 100 century bc found at the major yuezhi/kushan site of khalchayan in northern bactria near modern denov uzbekistan the head is sometimes described as saka a people often conflated with the yuezhi.nthe central asian people who called themselves kushana who were among the conquerors of the greco-bactrian kingdom during the 2nd century bc are widely believed to have originated as a dynastic clan or tribe of the yuezhi because some inhabitants of bactria became known as tukhra sanskrit or tkharoi greek these names later became associated with the yuezhi.nthe kushana were a caucasoid people as indicated by the portraits of their kings on the coins they struck in bactria 2nd1st century bc portraits from statues in khalchayan bactria in the 1st century bc and especially the coins which they struck in india as kushans 1st3rd century ce.nthey spoke bactrian an eastern iranian language.nnbactriaeditnin the 3rd century bc bactria had been conquered by the greeks under alexander the great and since settled by the hellenistic civilization of the seleucids.nnthe resulting greco-bactrian kingdom lasted until the 2nd century bc the area came under pressure from various nomadic peoples and the greek city of alexandria on the oxus was apparently burnt to the ground in about 145 bc the last greco-bactrian king heliocles i retreated and moved his capital to the kabul valley in about 140130 bc the greco-bactrian state was conquered by the nomads and dissolved the greek geographer strabo mentions this event in his account of the central asian tribes he called scythians all or the greatest part of them are nomads the best known tribes are those who deprived the greeks of bactriana the asii pasiani tochari and sacarauli who came from the country on the other side of the jaxartes syr darya opposite the sacae and sogdiani strabo n the roman historian pompeius trogus 1st century bc attributes destruction of the greco-bactrian state to the sacaraucae and the asiani kings of the tochari both pompeius and justin 2nd century ce record that the parthian king artabanus ii was mortally wounded in a war against the tokhari in 124 bc.nseveral relationships between these tribes and those named in chinese sources have been proposed but remain contentious.nn kushana copy of a coin of greco-bactrian king helioclesn kushana copy of a coin of greco-bactrian king heliocles with original horse on the reversenafter they settled in bactria the yuezhi became hellenized to some degree as shown by their adoption of the greek alphabet and by some remaining coins minted in the style of the greco-bactrian kings with the text in greek the area of bactria they settled came to be known as tokharistan and the yuezhi were known as tkharoi by the greeks.nnin the hindu kusheditnthe area of the hindu kush paropamisadae was ruled by the western indo-greek king until the reign of hermaeus reigned c 90 bc70 bc after that date no indo-greek kings are known in the area according to bopearachchi no trace of indo-scythian occupation nor coins of major indo-scythian rulers such as maues or azes i have been found in the paropamisade and western gandhara the hindu kush may have been subsumed by the yuezhi who by then had been dominated by greco-bactria for almost two centuries.nas they had done in bactria with their copying of greco-bactrian coinage the yuezhi copied the coinage of hermeaus on a vast scale up to around 40 ce when the design blends into the coinage of the kushan king kujula kadphises such coins may provide the earliest known names of yuezhi yabgu a minor royal title similar to prince namely

the kushan empire which was to rule the region for several centuries despite their change of name most chinese authors continued to refer to the kushanas as the yuezhi.nthe kushanas expanded to the east during the 1st century ce the first kushan emperor kujula kadphises ostensibly associated himself with king hermaeus on his coins suggesting that he may have been one of the kings descendants by alliance or at least wanted to claim his legacy.nthe kushanas integrated buddhism into a pantheon of many deities and became great promoters of mahayana buddhism and their interactions with greek civilization helped the gandharan culture and greco-buddhism flourish.nduring the 1st and 2nd centuries the kushan empire expanded militarily to the north and occupied parts of the tarim basin putting them at the center of the lucrative central asian commerce with the roman empire the kushanas collaborated militarily with the chinese against their mutual enemies this included a campaign with the chinese general ban chao against the sogdians in 84 ce when the latter were trying to support a revolt by the king of kashgar in around 85 ce the kushanas also assisted the chinese in an attack on

kushan troops installed chenpan a prince who had been sent as a hostage to them and had become a favorite of the kushan emperor on the throne of kashgar thus expanding their power and influence in the

were influential translators of the mahayana sutras into chinese they who went to china and established translation bureaus thereby being at the center of the silk road transmission of buddhism.nin

yuezhi may have been used as a generic term for various caucasoid minorities that remained in northern china following the migration of the greater yuezhi the term is used of peoples in locations as diverse as tibet qinghai shanxi and the tarim basin.nsome of the lesser yuezhi settled among the qiang people of huangzhong qinghai according to archaeologist sophia-katrin psarras yuezhi and qiang were said to be among members of the auxiliary of loyal barbarians from huangzhong that mutinied against the han dynasty in the liangzhou rebellion 184221 ce.nelements of the lesser yuezhi are said to have been a component of the jie people who originated from yushe county in shanxi other theories link the jie more strongly to the xiongnu kangju or the tocharian-speaking peoples of the tarim led by emperor shi le the jie established the later zhao state 319351 ce and were massacred by king ran min of the ran wei state during the weijie war.nin tibet the lesser yuezhi constituted the gar or mgar a clan name associated with blacksmiths the gar became influential during the period of the tibetan empire until the end of the 7th century when 2,000 of them were massacred by the tibetan emperor tridu songtsn.nsome of the lesser yuezhi are said to have founded the city state of cumua also cimuda or cunuda near the lop nur lake system in the eastern tarim cumua and its people were known to the han as zhongyun pinyin wadegiles tchong-yun in the 10th century a chinese monk named gao juhui who had traveled to the tarim basin stated that the zhongyun were descendants of the xiao yuezhi and that the king of zhongyun resided near lop nur following the subsequent settlement of uyghur-speaking people in the area cumua became known as ungul xungul and kumul under subsequent han chinese influence it became known as hami nwhatever their fate may have been the xiao yuezhi ceased to be identifiable by that name and appear to have been subsumed by other ethnicities including tibetans uyghurs and han.nnproposed links to other groupseditn a depiction of the kushan ruler heraios who reigned 130 ce.nthe relationship between the yuezhi and other central asian peoples is unclear based on claimed similarities of names different scholars have linked them to several groups but none of these identifications is widely accepted.nmallory and mair suggest that the yuezhi and wusun were among the nomadic peoples at least some of whom spoke iranian languages who moved into northern xinjiang from the central asian steppe in the 2nd millennium bce.nscholars such as edwin pulleyblank josef markwart a.k.a joseph marquart and lszl torday suggest that the name iatioi a central asian people mentioned by ptolemy in geography 150 ce may also be an attempt to render yuezhi.nthere has been only limited scholarly support for a theory developed by w b henning who proposed that the yuezhi were descended from the guti or gutians and an associated but little known tribe known as the tukri who were native to the zagros mountains modern iran/iraq during the mid-3rd millennium bce in addition to phonological similarities between these names and jat-kje and tukhra henning pointed out that the guti could have migrated from the zagros to gansu by the time that the yuezhi entered the historical record in china during the 1st millennium bc however the only material evidence presented by henning namely similar ceramic ware is generally considered to be far from conclusive.nproposed links with the aorsi asii getae goths gushi jatts massagetae and other groups have also gathered little support.nwhen manuscripts dating from the 6th to 8th centuries ad written in two hitherto-unknown languages were discovered in the northern tarim basin the early 20th-century linguist friedrich w k mller assumed that the authors were tkharoi and referred to the newly discovered languages as tocharian this became the common name for both the languages of the tarim manuscripts and the people who produced them most historians now reject the identification of the tocharians of the tarim with the tkharoi of bactria who are not known to have spoken any languages other than bactrian other scholars suggest that the kushanas may previously have spoken tocharian before shifting to bactrian on their arrival in bactria an example of an invading or colonising elite adopting a local language.nhowever while tocharian contains some loanwords from bactrian there are no traces of tocharian in bactrian.nanother possible endonym of the yuezhi was put forward by h w bailey claimed that they were referred to in 9th and 10th century khotan saka iranian texts as the gara according to bailey the tu gara great gara were the great yuezhi this is consistent with the ancient greek tokharoi latinised tochari in reference to the faction of the kushans that conquered bactria as well as the tibetan language name gar or mgar for the members of the lesser yuezhi who settled in the tibetan empire.nnsee
