is a tethered heavier-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag a kite consists of wings tethers and anchors kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it some kite designs dont need a bridle box kites can have a single attachment point a kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite one technical definition is that a kite is a collection of tether-coupled wing sets.nthe lift that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air moves around the kites surface producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings the interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along the direction of the wind the resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of one or more of the lines or tethers to which the kite is attached the anchor point of the kite line may be static or moving e.g the towing of a kite by a running person boat free-falling anchors as in paragliders and fugitive parakites or vehicle.nthe same principles of fluid flow apply in liquids so kites can be used in underwater currents but there are no everyday
