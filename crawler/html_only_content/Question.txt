propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics the information requested is expected to be provided in the form of an answer questions are often conflated with interrogatives which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them rhetorical questions for example are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered conversely non-interrogative grammatical structures may be considered questions as in the case of the imperative sentence tell me your name".nncontentsnnnuseseditn

scholarly or scientific inquiry designed to address a specific gap in knowledge research questions are expressed in a language that is appropriate for the academic community that has the greatest interest in answers that would address said gap these interrogative statements serve as launching points for the academic pursuit of new knowledge by directing and delimiting an investigation of a topic a set of studies or an entire program of research.na rhetorical question is asked to make a point and does not expect an answer often the answer is implied or obvious as such it is not a true question similarly requests for things other than information as with would you pass the salt are interrogative in form but are not true questions.npre-suppositional or loaded questions such as have

choice there are also nominal questions designed to inquire about a level of quantitative measure usually making connections between a number and a concept as in 1 moderate 2 severe 3 open-ended or open questions give the respondent greater freedom to provide information or opinions on a topic the distinction between closed and open questions is applied in a variety of other contexts too such as job interviewing surveys also often contain qualifying questions also called filter questions or contingency questions which serve to determine whether the respondent needs to continue on to answer subsequent questions.nsome types of questions that may be used in an educational context are listed in blooms taxonomy of educational objectives these include questions designed to test and

that is similar in form to a yesno question but is not intended to be answered with a yes or no is the alternative question or choice question this presents two or more alternative answers as in do you want fish or lamb or are you supporting england ireland or wales the expected response is one of the alternatives or some other indication such as both or neither questionnaire forms sometimes contain an option none of the above or similar for such questions because of their similarity in form to yesno questions they may sometimes be answered yes or no possibly humorously or as a result of misunderstanding.nthe other main type of question other than yesno questions is those called wh-questions or non-polar questions or special questions these use interrogative words wh-words such as when which who how etc to specify the information that is desired in some languages the formation of such questions may involve wh-movement see the section below for grammatical description the name derives from the fact that most of the english interrogative words with the exception of how begin with the letters wh these are the types of question sometimes referred to in journalism and other investigative contexts as the five ws.ntag questions are a grammatical structure in which a declarative statement or an imperative is turned into a question by adding an interrogative fragment the tag

there also exist indirect questions also called interrogative content clauses such as where my keys are these are used as subordinate clauses in sentences such as i wonder where my keys are and ask him where my keys are indirect questions do not necessarily follow the same rules of grammar as direct questions for example in english and some other languages indirect questions are formed without inversion of subject and verb compare the word order in where are they and i wonder where they are indirect questions may also be subject to the changes of tense and other changes that apply generally to indirect speech.nngrammareditnmain article interrogativenlanguages may use both syntax and prosody to distinguish interrogative sentences which pose questions from declarative sentences which state propositions syntax refers to grammatical changes such as moving words around or adding question words prosody refers here to changes in intonation while speaking.nin english german french and various other languages questions are marked by a distinct word order featuring inversion the subject is placed after the verb rather than before it you are cold becomes are you cold however english allows such inversion only with a particular class of verbs called auxiliary or special verbs and thus sometimes requires the addition of an auxiliary do does or did before inversion can take place he sings

a question is an answer that provides the information indicated as being sought by the questioner this may range from a simple yes or no in the case of yesno questions to a more complex or detailed answer an answer may be correct or incorrect depending on whether the information it presents is true or false an indication of inability or unwillingness to provide an answer is the other response to a question.n"negative questions are interrogative sentences which contain negation in their phrasing such as shouldnt you be working these can have different ways of expressing affirmation and denial from the standard form of question and they can be confusing since it is sometimes unclear whether the answer should be the opposite of the answer to the non-negated question for example if one does not have a passport both do you have a passport and dont you have a passport are properly answered with no despite apparently asking opposite questions the japanese and korean languages avoid this ambiguity answering no to the second of these in japanese or korean would mean i do have a passport".na similar ambiguous question in english is do you mind if the responder may reply unambiguously yes i do mind if they do mind or no i dont mind if they dont but a simple no or yes answer can lead to confusion as a single no can seem like a yes i do mind as in no please dont do that and a yes can seem like a no i dont mind as in yes go ahead an easy way to bypass this confusion would be to ask a non-negative question such as is it all right with you if...?"nsome languages have different particles for example the french si the german doch or the danish and norwegian jo to answer negative questions or negative statements in an affirmative way they provide a means to express contradiction.nmore information on these issues can be found in the articles yesno question yes and no and answer ellipsis.nnlearningeditnquestions are used from the most elementary stage of learning to original research in the scientific method a question often forms the basis of the investigation and can be considered a transition between the observation and hypothesis stages students of all ages use questions in their learning of topics and the skill of having learners creating investigatable questions is a central part of inquiry education the socratic method of questioning student responses may be used by a teacher to lead the student towards the truth without direct instruction and also helps students to form logical conclusions.na widespread and accepted use of questions in an educational context is the assessment of students knowledge through exams.nnphilosophyeditnnthe philosophical questions are conceptual not factual questions there are questions that are not fully answered by any other philosophy deals with questions that arise when people reflect on their lives and their world some philosophical questions are practical for example is euthanasia justifiable does the state have the right to censor pornography or restrict tobacco advertising to what extent are mori and pkeh today responsible for decisions made by their ancestors?"nother philosophical questions are more theoretical although they often arise through thinking about practical issues the questions just listed for example may prompt more general philosophical questions about the circumstances under which it may be morally justifiable to take a life or about the extent to which the state may restrict the liberty of the individual some classic questions of philosophy are speculative and theoretical and concern the nature of knowledge reality and human existence for example what if anything can be known with certainty is the mind essentially non-physical are values absolute or relative does the universe need explanation in terms of a supreme intelligence what if anything is the meaning or purpose of human existence finally the philosophical questions are typically about conceptual issues they are often questions about our concepts and the relation between our concepts and the world they represent every question implies a statement and every statement implies a question.nnoriginseditnenculturated apes kanzi washoe sarah and a few others who underwent extensive language training programs with the use of gestures and other visual forms of communications successfully learned to answer quite complex questions and requests including question words who what where although so far they failed to learn how to ask questions themselves for example david and anne premack wrote though she sarah understood the question she did not herself ask any questions unlike the child who asks interminable questions such as what that who making noise when daddy come home me go grannys house where puppy sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going when she was returning or anything else the ability to ask questions is often assessed in relation to comprehension of syntactic structures it is widely accepted that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy at the pre-syntactic one word stage of language development with the use of question intonation.nnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnfurther readingeditnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
