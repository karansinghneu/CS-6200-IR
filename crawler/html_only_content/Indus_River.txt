of the longest rivers in asia originating in the tibetan plateau in the vicinity of lake manasarovar the river runs a course through the ladakh region of indian state jammu and kashmir towards the gilgit-baltistan region of pakistan and the hindukush ranges and then flows in a southerly direction along the entire length of pakistan to merge into the arabian sea near the port city of karachi in sindh it is the longest river and national river of pakistan.nthe river has a total drainage area exceeding 1,165,000 km 450,000 sq mi its estimated annual flow stands at around 243 km 58 cu mi twice that of the nile river and three times that of the tigris and euphrates rivers combined making it the twenty-first largest river in the world in terms of annual flow the zanskar is its left bank tributary in ladakh in the plains its left bank tributary is the panjnad which itself has five major tributaries namely the chenab jhelum the ravi the beas and the sutlej its principal right bank tributaries are the shyok the gilgit the kabul the gomal and the kurram beginning in a mountain spring and fed with glaciers and rivers in the himalayas the river supports ecosystems of temperate forests plains and arid countryside.nthe northern part of the indus valley with its tributaries forms the punjab region while the lower course of the indus is known as sindh and ends in a large delta the river has historically been important to many cultures of the region the 3rd millennium bc saw the rise of a major urban civilization of the bronze age during the 2nd millennium bc the punjab region was mentioned in the hymns of the hindu rigveda as sapta sindhu and the zoroastrian avesta as hapta hindu both terms meaning seven rivers early historical kingdoms that arose in the indus valley include gandhra and the ror dynasty of sauvra the indus river came into the knowledge of the west early in the classical period when king darius of persia sent his greek subject scylax of caryanda to explore the river ca 515 bc.nncontentsnnnetymology and nameseditnthis river was known to the ancient indians in sanskrit as sindhu and the persians as hindu which was regarded by both of them as the border river the variation between the two names is explained by the old iranian sound change s h which occurred between 850600 bce according to asko parpola from the persian achaemenid empire the name passed to the greeks as inds it was adopted by the romans as indus.nthe meaning of sindhu as a large body of water sea or ocean is a later meaning in classical sanskrit a later persian name for the river was darya which similarly has the connotations of large body of water and sea.nother variants of the name sindhu include assyrian sinda as early as the 7th century bc persian ab-e-sind pashto abasind arab al-sind chinese sintow and javanese santri.nnindus and the name of indiaeditnindia is a greek and latin term for the country of the river indus the region through which the river drains into sea is called sindh and owes its name to the river sanskrit sindhu.nmegasthenes book indica derives its name from the rivers greek name inds and describes nearchuss contemporaneous account of how alexander the great crossed the river the ancient greeks referred to the indians people of present-day northwest india and pakistan as indi literally meaning the people of the indus".nnrigveda and the induseditnthe rigveda describes several rivers including one named sindhu the rigvedic sindhu is thought to be the present-day indus river it is attested 176 times in its text 94 times in the plural and most often used in the generic sense of river in the rigveda notably in the later hymns the meaning of the word is narrowed to refer to the indus river in particular e.g in the list of rivers mentioned in the hymn of nadistuti sukta the rigvedic hymns apply a feminine gender to all the rivers mentioned therein except the bramhaputra and the sindhu which carry the masculine gender this gender usage could mean that the sindhu river was believed to be a warrior and thus one of the greatest among all the rivers in the whole world.nnother nameseditnin other languages of the region the river is known as sindhu in hindi and nepali sindhu in sindhi sindh in shahmukhi punjabi sindh nad in gurmukh punjabi absin lit father of rivers in pashto nahar al-sind in arabic singi khamban lit lion river or lion spring in tibetan ynd in chinese and nilab in turki.nndescriptioneditn babur crossing the indus river.nthe indus river provides key water resources for pakistans economy especially the breadbasket of punjab province which accounts for most of the nations agricultural production and sindh the word punjab means land of five rivers and the five rivers are jhelum chenab ravi beas and sutlej all of which finally flow into the indus the indus also supports many heavy industries and provides the main supply of potable water in pakistan.nthe ultimate source of the indus is in tibet the river begins at the confluence of the sengge zangbo and gar tsangpo rivers that drain the nganglong kangri and gangdise shan gang rinpoche mt kailash mountain ranges the indus then flows northwest through ladakh india and baltistan into gilgit just south of the karakoram range the shyok shigar and gilgit rivers carry glacial waters into the main river it gradually bends to the south and descends into the punjab plains at kalabagh pakistan the indus passes gigantic gorges 4,5005,200 metres 15,00017,000 feet deep near the nanga parbat massif it flows swiftly across hazara and is dammed at the tarbela reservoir the kabul river joins it near attock the remainder of its route to the sea is in the plains of the punjab and sindh where the flow of the river becomes slow and highly braided it is joined by the panjnad at mithankot beyond this confluence the river at one time was named the satnad river sat seven nad river as the river now carried the waters of the kabul river the indus river and the five punjab rivers passing by jamshoro it ends in a large delta to the south of thatta in the sindh province of pakistannthe indus is one of the few rivers in the world to exhibit a tidal bore the indus system is largely fed by the snows and glaciers of the himalayas karakoram and the hindu kush ranges of tibet the indian states of jammu and kashmir and himachal pradesh and gilgit-baltistan region of pakistan the flow of the river is also determined by the seasons it diminishes greatly in the winter while flooding its banks in the monsoon months from july to september there is also evidence of a steady shift in the course of the river since prehistoric times it deviated westwards from flowing into the rann of kutch and adjoining banni grasslands after the 1816 earthquake presently indus water flows in to the rann of kutch during its floods breaching flood banks.nthe traditional source of the river is the senge khabab or lions mouth a perennial spring not far from the sacred mount kailash marked by a long low line of tibetan chortens there are several other tributaries nearby which may possibly form a longer stream than senge khabab but unlike the senge khabab are all dependent on snowmelt the zanskar river which flows into the indus in ladakh has a greater volume of water than the indus itself before that point.nnhistoryeditn extent and major sites of the indus valley civilisation 3000 bcnmain articles indus valley civilization and history of sindhnthe major cities of the indus valley civilisation such as harappa and mohenjo-daro date back to around 3300 bc and represent some of the largest human habitations of the ancient world the indus valley civilisation extended from across northeast afghanistan to pakistan and northwest india with an upward reach from east of jhelum river to ropar on the upper sutlej the coastal settlements extended from sutkagan dor at the pakistan iran border to kutch in modern gujarat india there is an indus site on the amu darya at shortughai in northern afghanistan and the indus site alamgirpur at the hindon river is located only 28 km 17 mi from delhi to date over 1,052 cities and settlements have been found mainly in the general region of the ghaggar-hakra river and its tributaries among the settlements were the major urban centres of harappa and mohenjo-daro as well as lothal dholavira ganeriwala and rakhigarhi only 9096 of more than 800 known indus valley sites have been discovered on the indus and its tributaries the sutlej now a tributary of the indus in harappan times flowed into the ghaggar-hakra river in the watershed of which were more harappan sites than along the indus.nmost scholars believe that settlements of gandhara grave culture of the early indo-aryans flourished in gandhara from 1700 bc to 600 bc when mohenjo-daro and harappa had already been abandoned.nthe word india is derived from the indus river in ancient times india initially referred to those regions immediately along the east bank of the indus but by 300 bc greek writers including herodotus and megasthenes were applying the term to the entire subcontinent that extends much farther eastward.nthe lower basin of the indus forms a natural boundary between the iranian plateau and the indian subcontinent this region embraces all or parts of the pakistani provinces balochistan khyber pakhtunkhwa punjab and sindh and the countries afghanistan and india it was crossed by the invading armies of alexander but after his macedonians conquered the west bankjoining it to the hellenic empire they elected to retreat along the southern course of the river ending alexanders asian campaign the indus plains were later dominated by the persian empire and then the kushan empire over several centuries muslim armies of muhammad bin qasim mahmud of ghazni mohammed ghori tamerlane and babur crossed the river to invade the inner regions of the punjab and points farther south and eastnngeographyeditnn the indus river near leh ladakhnntributarieseditnnnngeologyeditn indus river viewed from the karakoram highway.n indus river near leh india 2014n

indus submarine fan which is the second largest sediment body on the earth it consists of around 5 million cubic kilometres of material eroded from the mountains studies of the sediment in the modern river indicate that the karakoram mountains in northern pakistan and india are the single most important source of material with the himalayas providing the next largest contribution mostly via the large rivers of the punjab jhelum ravi chenab beas and sutlej analysis of sediments from the arabian sea has demonstrated that prior to five million years ago the indus was not connected to these punjab rivers which instead flowed east into the ganga and were captured after that time earlier work showed that sand and silt from western tibet was reaching the arabian sea by 45 million years ago implying the existence of an ancient indus river by that time the delta of this proto-indus river has subsequently been found in the katawaz basin on the afghan-pakistan border.nin the nanga parbat region the massive amounts of erosion due to the indus river following the capture and rerouting through that area is thought to bring middle and lower crustal rocks to the surface.nin november 2011 satellite images showed that the indus river had re-entered india feeding great rann of kutch little rann of kutch and a lake near ahmedabad known as nal sarovar heavy rains had left the river basin along with the lake manchar lake hemal and kalri lake all in modern-day pakistan inundated this happened two centuries after the indus river shifted its course westwards following the 1819 rann of

encountering rhinoceroses along its bank in his memoirs the baburnama extensive deforestation and human interference in the ecology of the shivalik hills has led to a marked deterioration in vegetation and growing conditions the indus valley regions are arid with poor vegetation agriculture is sustained largely due to irrigation works.nthe indus river and its watershed has a rich

has been recognized by conservationists as one of the worlds most important ecological regions here the river turns into many marshes streams and creeks and meets the sea at shallow levels here marine fishes are found in abundance including pomfret and prawns.nneconomyeditnthe indus is the most important supplier of water resources to the punjab and sindh plains it forms the backbone of agriculture and food production in pakistan the river is especially critical since rainfall is meagre in the lower indus valley irrigation canals were first built by the people of the indus valley civilisation and later by the engineers of the kushan empire and the mughal empire modern irrigation was introduced by the british east india company in 1850 the construction of modern canals accompanied with the restoration of old canals the british supervised the construction of one of the most complex irrigation networks in the world the guddu barrage is 1,350 m 4,430 ft long irrigating sukkur jacobabad larkana and kalat the sukkur barrage serves over 20,000 km 7,700 sq mi.nafter pakistan came into existence a water control treaty signed between india and pakistan in 1960 guaranteed that pakistan would receive water from the indus river and its two tributaries the jhelum river the chenab river independently of upstream control by india.nthe indus basin project consisted primarily of the construction of two main dams the mangla dam built on the jhelum river and the tarbela dam constructed on the indus river together with their subsidiary dams the pakistan water and power development authority undertook the construction of the chashma-jhelum link canal linking the waters of the indus and jhelum rivers extending water supplies to the regions of bahawalpur and multan pakistan constructed the tarbela dam near rawalpindi standing 2,743 metres 9,000 ft long and 143 metres 470 ft high with an 80-kilometre 50 mi long reservoir it supports the chashma barrage near dera ismail khan for irrigation use and flood control and the taunsa barrage near dera ghazi khan which also produces 100,000 kilowatts of electricity the kotri barrage near hyderabad is 915 metres 3,000 ft long and provides additional water supplies for karachi the extensive linking of tributaries with the indus has helped spread water resources to the valley of peshawar in the khyber pakhtunkhwa the extensive irrigation and dam projects provide the basis for pakistans large production of crops such as cotton sugarcane and wheat the dams also generate electricity for heavy industries and urban centers.nnpeopleeditn the indus river near skardu in gilgitbaltistan.n the dubair khwarr a tributary of the indus near shaikhdara in khyber pakhtunkhwa.nthe inhabitants of the regions are mainly

issueseditnn satellite images of the upper indus river valley comparing water-levels on 1 august 2009 top and 31 july 2010 bottomnthe indus is a strategically vital resource for pakistans economy and society after pakistan and india declared independence from the british raj the use of the waters of the indus and its five eastern tributaries became a major dispute between india and pakistan the irrigation canals of the sutlej valley and the bari doab were split with the canals lying primarily in pakistan and the headwork dams in india disrupting supply in some parts of pakistan the concern over india building large dams over various punjab rivers that could undercut the supply flowing to pakistan as well as the possibility that india could divert rivers in the time of war caused political consternation in pakistan holding diplomatic talks brokered by the world bank india and pakistan signed the indus waters treaty in 1960 the treaty gave india control of the three easternmost rivers of the punjab the sutlej the beas and the ravi while pakistan gained control of the three western rivers the jhelum the chenab and the indus india retained the right to use of the western rivers for non-irrigation projects.nlarge-scale diversion of the rivers water for irrigation has raised far-reaching issues sediment clogging from poor maintenance of canals has affected agricultural production and vegetation on numerous occasions irrigation itself is increasing soil salinization reducing crop yields and in some cases rendering farmland useless for cultivation and ecologically the reduced flow of fresh water and silt into the indus delta is threatening the areas mangrove forests.nthere are also concerns that the indus river may be shifting its course westwards although the progression spans centuries.nnindus deltaeditnmain article indus river deltanoriginally the delta used to receive almost all of the water from the indus river which has an annual flow of approximately 180 billion cubic metres 240 billion cubic yards and is accompanied by 400 million tonnes 390 million long tons of silt since the 1940s dams barrages and irrigation works have been constructed on the river indus the indus basin irrigation system is the largest contiguous irrigation system developed over the past 140 years anywhere in the world this has reduced the flow of water and by 2018 the average annual flow of water below the kotri barrage was 33 billion cubic metres 43 billion cubic yards and annual amount of silt discharged was estimated at 100 million tonnes 98 million long tons as a result the 2010 pakistan floods were considered good news for the ecosystem and population of the river delta as they brought much needed fresh water any further utilization of the river basin water is not economically feasible.nvegetation and wildlife of the indus delta are threatened by the reduced inflow of fresh water along with extensive deforestation industrial pollution and global warming damming has also isolated the delta population of indus river dolphins from those further upstream.nneffects of climate change on the rivereditnthe tibetan plateau contains the worlds third-largest store of ice qin dahe the former head of the china meteorological administration said the recent fast pace of melting and warmer temperatures will be good for agriculture and tourism in the short term but issued a strong warning:nnn"there is insufficient data to say what will happen to the indus says david grey the world banks senior water advisor in south asia but we all have very nasty fears that the flows of the indus could be severely severely affected by glacier melt as a consequence of climate change and reduced by perhaps as much as 50 percent now what does that mean to a population that lives in a desert where without the river there would be no life i dont know the answer to that question he says but we need to be concerned about that deeply deeply concerned."nu.s diplomat richard holbrooke said shortly before his death in 2010 that he believed that falling water levels in the indus river could very well precipitate world war iii."nnpollutioneditnover the years factories on the banks of the indus river have increased levels of water pollution in the river and the atmosphere around it high levels of pollutants in the river have led to the deaths of endangered indus river dolphin the sindh environmental protection agency has ordered polluting factories around the river to shut down under the pakistan environmental protection act 1997 death of the indus river dolphin has also been attributed to fishermen using poison to kill fish and scooping them up as a result the government banned fishing from guddu barrage to sukkur.ncoming second after the yangtze and together with 9 other rivers the indus transports 90 of all the plastic that reaches the oceans.nn2010 floodseditn affected areas as of 26 august 2010nmain article 2010 pakistan floodsnfrequently

months devastating large areas of pakistan in sindh the indus burst its banks near sukkur on 8 august submerging the village of mor khan jatoi in early august the heaviest flooding moved southward along the indus river from severely affected northern regions toward western punjab where at least 1,400,000 acres 570,000 ha of cropland was destroyed and the southern province of sindh as of september 2010 over two thousand people had died and over a million homes had been destroyed since the flooding began.nn2011 floodseditnmain article 2011 sindh floodsnthe 2011 sindh floods began
