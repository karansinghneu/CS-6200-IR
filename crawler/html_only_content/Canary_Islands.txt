european union proper it is also one of the eight regions with special consideration of historical nationality recognized as such by the spanish government the canary islands belong to the african

spain and the largest and most populated archipelago of the macaronesia region historically the canary islands has been considered a bridge between four continents africa north america south america and europe.nthe archipelagos beaches climate and important natural attractions especially maspalomas in gran canaria and teide national park and mount teide a world heritage site in tenerife the third tallest volcano in the world measured from its base on the ocean floor make it a major tourist destination with over 12 million visitors per year especially gran canaria tenerife fuerteventura and lanzarote the islands have a subtropical climate with long hot summers and moderately warm winters the precipitation levels and the level of maritime moderation vary depending on location and elevation green areas as well as desert exist on the archipelago due to their location above the temperature inversion layer the high mountains of these islands are ideal for astronomical observation for this reason two professional observatories teide observatory on the island of tenerife and roque de los muchachos observatory on the island of la palma have been built on the islands.nin 1927 the province of canary islands was split into two provinces the autonomous community of the canary islands was established in 1982 its capital is shared by the cities of santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria which in turn are the capitals of the provinces of santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas las palmas de gran canaria has been the largest city in the canaries since 1768 except for a brief period in the 1910s between the 1833 territorial division of spain and 1927 santa cruz de tenerife was the sole capital of the canary islands in 1927 a decree ordered that the capital of the canary islands be shared as it remains at present the third largest city of the canary islands is san cristbal de la laguna a world heritage site on tenerife this city is also home to the consejo consultivo de canarias which is the supreme consultative body of the canary islands.nduring the time of the spanish empire the canaries were the main stopover for spanish galleons on their way to the americas which came south to catch the prevailing northeasterly trade winds.nncontentsnnnetymologyeditnthe name islas canarias is likely derived from the latin name canariae insulae meaning islands of the dogs a name that was applied only to gran canaria according to the historian pliny the elder the mauretanian king juba ii named the island canaria because it contained vast multitudes of dogs of very large size".nalternatively it is said that the original inhabitants of the island guanches used to worship dogs mummified them and treated dogs generally as holy animals the ancient greeks also knew about a people living far to the west who are the dog-headed ones who worshipped dogs on an island some hypothesize that the canary islands dog-worship and the ancient egyptian cult of the dog-headed god anubis are closely connected but there is no explanation given as to which one was first.nother theories speculate that the name comes from the nukkari berber tribe living in the moroccan atlas named in roman sources as canarii though pliny again mentions the relation of this term with dogs.nthe connection to dogs is retained in their depiction on the islands coat-of-arms.nit is considered that the aborigines of gran canaria called themselves canarios it is possible that after being conquered this name was used in plural in spanish i.e as to refer to all of the islands as the canarii-as.nwhat is certain is that the name of the islands does not derive from the canary bird rather the birds are named after the islands.nnphysical geographyeditn map of the canary islandsn

madeira and the savage isles the canary islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the macaronesia region the archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands all of which are volcanic in origin.naccording to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east trade winds the climate can be mild and wet or very dry several native species form laurisilva forests.nas a consequence the individual islands in the canary archipelago tend to have distinct microclimates those islands such as el hierro la palma and la gomera lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist canary current they are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest as one travels east toward the african coast the influence of the current diminishes and the islands become increasingly arid fuerteventura and lanzarote the islands which are closest to the african mainland are effectively desert or semi desert gran canaria is known as a continent in miniature for its diverse landscapes like maspalomas and roque nublo in terms of its climate tenerife is particularly interesting the north of the island lies under the influence of the moist atlantic winds and is well vegetated while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of playa de las americas and los cristianos is arid the island rises to almost 4,000 m 13,000 ft above sea level and at altitude in the cool relatively wet climate forests of the endemic pine pinus canariensis thrive many of the plant species in the canary islands like the canary island pine and the dragon tree dracaena draco are endemic as noted by sabin berthelot and philip barker webb in their epic work lhistoire naturelle des les canaries 183550.nnclimateeditnthe climate is subtropical and desertic moderated by the sea and in summer by the trade winds there are a number of microclimates and the classifications range mainly from semi-arid to desert according to the kppen climate classification the majority of the canary islands have a hot desert climate represented as bwh there also exists a subtropical humid climate which is very influenced by the ocean in the middle of the islands of la gomera tenerife and la palma where the laurisilva forests grow.nnnnnnngeologyeditnthe seven major islands one minor island and several small islets were originally volcanic islands formed by the canary hotspot the canary islands is the only place in spain where volcanic eruptions have been recorded during the modern era with some volcanoes still active el hierro 2011.nvolcanic islands such as those in the canary chain often have steep ocean cliffs caused by catastrophic debris avalanches and landslides.nthe teide volcano on tenerife is the highest mountain in spain and the third tallest volcano on earth on a volcanic ocean island all the islands except la gomera have been active in the last million years four of them lanzarote tenerife la palma and el hierro have historical records of eruptions since european discovery the islands rise from jurassic oceanic crust associated with the opening of the atlantic underwater magmatism commenced during the cretaceous and reached the oceans surface during the miocene the islands are considered as a distinct physiographic section of the atlas mountains province which in turn is part of the larger african alpine system division.nin the summer of 2011 a series of low-magnitude earthquakes occurred beneath el hierro these had a linear trend of northeast-southwest in october a submarine eruption occurred about 2 km 1 mi south of restinga this eruption produced gases and pumice but no explosive activity was reported.nthe following

geographyeditnthe autonomous community of the canary islands consists of two provinces provincias las palmas and santa cruz de tenerife whose capitals las palmas de gran canaria and santa cruz de tenerife are capitals of the autonomous community each of the seven major islands is ruled by an island council named cabildo insular each island is subdivided into smaller municipalities municipios las palmas is divided into 34 municipalities and santa cruz de tenerife is divided into 54 municipalities.nthe international boundary of the canaries is the subject of dispute between spain and morocco moroccos official position is that international laws regarding territorial limits do not authorise spain to claim seabed boundaries based on the territory of the canaries since the canary islands enjoy a large degree of autonomy in fact the islands do not enjoy any special degree of autonomy as each one of the spanish regions is considered an autonomous community with equal status to the european ones under the law of the sea the only islands not granted territorial waters or an exclusive economic zone eez are those that are not fit for human habitation or do not have an economic life of their own which is not the case of the canary islands.nthe boundary determines the ownership of seabed oil deposits and other ocean resources morocco and spain have been unable to agree on a compromise regarding the territorial boundary since neither nation wants to cede its claimed right to the vast resources whose ownership depends upon the boundary in 2002 for example morocco rejected a unilateral spanish proposal.nncanarian nationalismeditnmain article canarian nationalismnthere are some pro-independence political parties like the national congress of the canaries cnc and the

carthaginians king juba ii caesar augustuss numidian protg is credited with discovering the islands for the western world according to pliny the elder juba found the islands uninhabited but found a small temple of stone and some traces of buildings juba dispatched a naval contingent to re-open the dye production facility at mogador in what is now western morocco in the early first century ad that same naval force was subsequently sent on an exploration of the canary islands using mogador as their mission base.nnnwhen the europeans began to explore the islands in the late middle ages they encountered several indigenous peoples living at a neolithic level of technology although the prehistory of the settlement of the canary islands is still unclear linguistic and genetic analyses seem to indicate that at least some of these inhabitants shared a common origin with the berbers on the nearby north african coast the precolonial inhabitants came to be known collectively as the guanches although guanches had been the name for only the indigenous inhabitants of tenerife from the 14th century onward numerous visits were made by sailors from majorca portugal and genoa lancelotto malocello settled on lanzarote in 1312 the majorcans established a mission with a bishop in the islands that lasted from 13501400.nncastilian conquesteditnmain articles conquest of the canary islands kingdom of the canary islands crown of castile and kingdom of portugalnin 1402 the castilian conquest of the islands began with the expedition of the french explorers jean de bthencourt and gadifer de la salle nobles and vassals of henry iii of castile to lanzarote from there they went on to conquer fuerteventura 1405 and el hierro bthencourt received the title king of the canary islands but still recognised king henry iii as his overlord it was not a simple military enterprise given the aboriginal resistance on some islands neither was it politically since the particular interests of the nobility determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands conflicted with those of the states particularly castile which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the crown against the nobility.nn alonso fernndez de lugo presenting the captured native guanche kings of tenerife to the catholic monarchsnhistorians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the canary islands:naristocratic conquest conquista seorial this refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the crown of castile which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the crown one can identify within this period an early phase known as the betancurian or norman conquest carried out by jean de bethencourt who was originally from normandy and gadifer de la salle between 1402 and 1405 which involved the islands of lanzarote el hierro and fuerteventura the subsequent phase is known as the castilian conquest carried out by castilian nobles who acquired through purchases assignments and marriages the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of la gomera around 1450.nroyal conquest conquista realenga this defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496 carried out directly by the crown of castile during the reign of the catholic monarchs who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still unconquered gran canaria la palma and tenerife

fully conquered the natives of la gomera and of gran canaria tenerife and la palma resisted the castilian invaders for almost a century in 1448 maciot de bthencourt sold the lordship of lanzarote to portugals prince henry the navigator an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the castilians despite pope nicholas v ruling that the canary islands were under portuguese control the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the portuguese in 1479 portugal and castile signed the treaty of alcovas which settled disputes between castile and portugal over the control of the atlantic this treaty recognized castilian control of the canary islands but also confirmed portuguese possession of the azores madeira and the cape verde islands and gave the portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the atlantic that might be discovered.nthe castilians continued to dominate the islands but due to the topography and the resistance of the native guanches they did not achieve complete control until 1496 when tenerife and la palma were finally subdued by alonso fernndez de lugo after that the canaries were incorporated into the kingdom of castile.nnafter the conquesteditn coat of arms of the castilian and spanish realm of canary islandsn maps of the canary islands drawn by william dampier during his voyage to new holland in

institutions of colonial government were founded gran canaria a colony of the crown of castile since 6 march 1480 from 1556 of spain and tenerife a spanish colony since 1495 each had its own governor.nthe cities of santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria became a stopping point for the spanish conquerors traders and missionaries on their way to the new world this trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands the islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over europe magnificent palaces and churches were built on la palma during this busy prosperous period the church of el salvador survives as one of the islands finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century.nthe canaries wealth invited attacks by pirates and privateers ottoman turkish admiral and privateer kemal reis ventured into the canaries in 1501 while murat reis the elder captured lanzarote in 1585.nthe most severe attack took place in 1599 during the dutch revolt a dutch fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men commanded by pieter van der does attacked the capital las palmas de gran canaria the city had 3,500 of gran canarias 8,545 inhabitants the dutch attacked the castillo de la luz which guarded the harbor the canarians evacuated civilians from the city and the castillo surrendered but not the city the dutch moved inland but canarian cavalry drove them back to tamaraceite near the city.nthe dutch then laid siege to the city demanding the surrender of all its wealth they received 12 sheep and 3 calves furious the dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the council of the canaries who were sheltering in the village of santa brgida 300 canarian soldiers ambushed the dutch in the village of monte lentiscal killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat the dutch concentrated on las palmas de gran canaria attempting to burn it down the dutch pillaged maspalomas on the southern coast of gran canaria san sebastin on la gomera and santa cruz on la palma but eventually gave up the siege of las palmas and withdrew.nin 1618 the barbary pirates attacked lanzarote and la gomera taking 1000

recessions on the islands a new cash crop cochineal cochinilla came into cultivation during this time saving the islands economy during this time the canarian-american trade was developed in which canarian products such as cochineal sugarcane and rum are sold in american ports such as veracruz campeche la guaira and havana among others.nby the end of the 18th century canary islanders had already emigrated to spanish american territories such as havana veracruz santo domingo san antonio texas and st bernard parish louisiana these economic difficulties spurred mass emigration primarily to the americas during the 19th and first half of the 20th century between 1840 and 1890 as many as 40,000 canary islanders emigrated to venezuela also thousands of canarians moved to puerto rico where the spanish monarchy felt that canarians would adapt to island life better than other immigrants from the mainland of spain deeply entrenched traditions such as the mascaras festival in the town of hatillo puerto rico are an example of canarian culture still preserved in puerto rico similarly many thousands of canarians emigrated to the shores of cuba during the spanishamerican war of 1898 the spanish fortified the islands against a possible american attack but no such event took place.nnromantic period and scientific expeditionseditn coast el golfo el hierronsirera and renn 2004

of which was controlled by companies such as fyffes.nthe rivalry between the elites of the cities of las palmas de gran canaria and santa cruz de tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the archipelago into two provinces in 1927 this has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities which continues to this day.nduring the time of the second spanish republic marxist and anarchist workers movements began to develop led by figures such as jose miguel perez and guillermo ascanio however outside of a few municipalities these organisations were a minority and fell

military revolt of 17 july which began the spanish civil war franco quickly took control of the archipelago except for a few points of resistance on la palma and in the town of vallehermoso on la gomera though there was never a war in the islands the post-war suppression of political dissent on the canaries was most severe.nduring the second world war winston churchill prepared plans for the british seizure of the canary islands as a naval base in the event of gibraltar being invaded from the spanish mainland.nopposition to francos regime did not begin to organise until the late 1950s which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the communist party of spain and the formation of various nationalist leftist parties.nnself-governanceeditn auditorio de tenerife by santiago

establishment of a democratic constitutional monarchy in spain autonomy was granted to the canaries via a law passed in 1982 with a newly established autonomous devolved government and parliament in 1983 the first autonomous elections were held the spanish socialist workers party psoe won in the 2007 elections the psoe gained a plurality of seats but the nationalist canarian coalition and the conservative partido popular pp formed a ruling coalition government.nncapitalityeditnat present the canary islands is the only autonomous community in spain that has two capitals santa cruz de tenerife and las palmas de gran canaria since the statute of autonomy of the canary islands was created in 1982.nthe political capital of the archipelago does not exist as such until the nineteenth century the first cities founded by the europeans at the time of the conquest of the canary islands in the 15th century were telde in gran canaria san marcial del rubicn in lanzarote and betancuria in fuerteventura these cities boasted the first european institutions present in the archipelago including catholic bishoprics although because the period of splendor of these cities developed before the total conquest of the archipelago and its incorporation into the crown of castile never had a political and real control of the entire canary archipelago.nn overview of las palmas de gran canaria.n view of santa cruz de tenerife.nthe function of a canarian city with full jurisdiction for the entire archipelago only exists after the conquest of the canary islands although originally de facto that is without legal and real meaning and linked to the headquarters of the canary islands general captaincy.nlas palmas de gran canaria was the first city that exercised this function this is because the residence of the captain general of the canary islands was in this city during part of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in may 1661 the captain general of the canary islands jernimo de benavente y quiones moved the headquarters of the captaincy to the city of san cristbal de la laguna on the island of tenerife this was due to the fact that this island since the conquest was the most populated productive and with the highest economic expectations la laguna would be considered the de facto capital of the archipelago until mid the official status of the capital of canary islands in the city of santa cruz de tenerife was confirmed in the 19th century due in part to the constant controversies and rivalries between the bourgeoisies of san cristbal de la laguna and las palmas de gran canaria for the economic political and institutional hegemony of the archipelago.nalready in 1723 the captain general of the canary islands lorenzo fernandez de villavicencio had moved the headquarters of the general captaincy of the canary islands from san cristbal de la laguna to santa cruz de tenerife this decision continued without pleasing the society of the island of gran canaria it would be after the creation of the province of canary islands in november of 1833 in which santa cruz would become the first fully official capital of the canary islands de jure and not of de facto as happened previously santa cruz de tenerife would be the capital of the canary archipelago until during the government of general primo de rivera in 1927 the province of canary islands was split in two provinces las palmas with capital in las palmas de gran canaria and santa cruz de tenerife with capital in the homonymous city.nfinally with the statute of autonomy of the canary islands in 1982
