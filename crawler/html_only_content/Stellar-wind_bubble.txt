stellar-wind bubble wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn"astrosphere redirects here for the astrosphere of the sun see heliosphere.na stellar-wind bubble is a cavity light years across filled with hot gas blown into the interstellar medium by the high-velocity several thousand km/s stellar wind from a single massive star of type o or b weaker stellar winds also blow bubble structures which are also called astrospheres the heliosphere blown by the solar wind within which all the major planets of the solar system are embedded is a small example of a stellar-wind bubble.nstellar-wind bubbles have a two-shock structure the freely-expanding stellar wind hits an inner termination shock where its kinetic energy is thermalized producing 10 k x-ray emitting plasma the hot high-pressure shocked wind expands driving a shock into the surrounding interstellar gas if the surrounding gas is dense enough number densities or so the swept-up gas radiatively cools far faster than the hot interior forming a thin relatively dense shell around the hot shocked wind.nnsee alsoeditnwolf-rayet nebulannreferenceseditnnnnnnn ncategories n
