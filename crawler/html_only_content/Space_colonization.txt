space colonization wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnn artists conception of a colony on the moonn artists conception of the interior of a bernal spherennspace colonization also called space settlement or extraterrestrial colonization is permanent human habitation off the planet earth.nmany arguments have been made for and against space colonization the two most common in favor of colonization are survival of human civilization and the biosphere in the event of a planetary-scale disaster natural or man-made and the availability of additional resources in space that could enable expansion of human society the most common objections to colonization include concerns that the commodification of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful including major economic and military institutions and to exacerbate pre-existing detrimental processes such as wars economic inequality and environmental degradation.nno space colonies have been built so far currently the building of a space colony would present a set of huge technological and economic challenges space settlements would have to provide for nearly all or all the material needs of hundreds or thousands of humans in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life they would involve technologies such as controlled ecological life support systems that have yet to be developed in any meaningful way they would also have to deal with the as-yet unknown issue of how humans would behave and thrive in such places long-term because of the present cost of sending anything from the surface of the earth into orbit around 2,500 per-pound to orbit expected to further decrease a space colony would currently be a massively expensive project.nthere are yet no plans for building space colonies by any large-scale organization either government or private however many proposals speculations and designs for space settlements have been made through the years and a considerable number of space colonization advocates and groups are active several famous scientists such as freeman dyson have come out in favor of space settlement.non the technological front there is ongoing progress in making access to space cheaper reusable launch systems could reach 10 per-pound to orbit and in creating automated manufacturing and construction techniques.nncontentsnnnreasonseditnsurvival of human civilizationeditnmain article space and survivalnthe primary argument calling for space colonization is the long-term survival of human civilization by developing alternative locations off earth the planets species including humans could live on in the event of natural or man-made disasters on our own planet.non two occasions theoretical physicist and cosmologist stephen hawking has argued for space colonization as a means of saving humanity in 2001 hawking predicted that the human race would become extinct within the next thousand years unless colonies could be established in space in 2006 he stated that humanity faces two options either we colonize space within the next two hundred years and build residential units on other planets or we will face the prospect of long-term extinction.nin 2005 then nasa administrator michael griffin identified space colonization as the ultimate goal of current spaceflight programs saying:nn the goal isnt just scientific exploration its also about extending the range of human habitat out from earth into the solar system as we go forward in time in the long run a single-planet species will not survive if we humans want to survive for hundreds of thousands or millions of years we must ultimately populate other planets now today the technology is such that this is barely conceivable were in the infancy of it im talking about that one day i dont know when that day is but there will be more human beings who live off the earth than on it we may well have people living on the moon we may have people living on the moons of jupiter and other planets we may have people making habitats on asteroids i know that humans will colonize the solar system and one day go beyond.nnlouis j halle formerly of the united states department of state wrote in foreign affairs summer 1980 that the colonization of space will protect humanity in the event of global nuclear warfare the physicist paul davies also supports the view that if a planetary catastrophe threatens the survival of the human species on earth a self-sufficient colony could reverse-colonize earth and restore human civilization the author and journalist william e burrows and the biochemist robert shapiro proposed a private project the alliance to rescue civilization with the goal of establishing an off-earth backup of human civilization.nbased on his copernican principle j richard gott has estimated that the human race could survive for another 7.8 million years but it is not likely to ever colonize other planets however he expressed a hope to be proven wrong because colonizing other worlds is our best chance to hedge our bets and improve the survival prospects of our species".nnvast resources in spaceeditnsee also steady-state economy pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer spacenresources in space both in materials and energy are enormous the solar system alone has according to different estimates enough material and energy to support anywhere from several thousand to over a billion times that of the current earth-based human population outside the solar system several hundred billion other planets in the milky way alone provide opportunities for both colonization and resource collection though travel to any of them is impossible on any practical time-scale without interstellar travel by use of generation ships or revolutionary new methods of travel such as faster-than-light ftl.nasteroid mining will also be a key player in space colonization water and materials to make structures and shielding can be easily found in asteroids instead of resupplying on earth mining and fuel stations need to be established on asteroids to facilitate better space travel optical mining is the term nasa uses to describe extracting materials from asteroids nasa believes by using propellant derived from asteroids for exploration to the moon mars and beyond will save 100 billion if funding and technology come sooner than estimated asteroid mining might be possible within a decade.nall these planets and other bodies offer a virtually endless supply of resources providing limitless growth potential harnessing these resources can lead to much economic development.nnexpansion with fewer negative consequenceseditnfurther information holocene extinctionnexpansion of humans and technological progress has usually resulted in some form of environmental devastation and destruction of ecosystems and their accompanying wildlife in the past expansion has often come at the expense of displacing many indigenous peoples the resulting treatment of these peoples ranging anywhere from encroachment to genocide because space has no known life this need not be a consequence as some space settlement advocates have pointed out.nnalleviating overpopulation and resource demandeditnsee also human overpopulation extraterrestrial settlementnanother argument for space colonization is to mitigate the negative effects of overpopulation.nif the resources of space were opened to use and viable life-supporting habitats were built earth would no longer define the limitations of growth although many of earths resources are non-renewable off-planet colonies could satisfy the majority of the planets resource requirements with the availability of extraterrestrial resources demand on terrestrial ones would decline.nnother argumentseditnadditional goals cite the innate human drive to explore and discover a quality recognized at the core of progress and thriving civilizations.nnick bostrom has argued that from a utilitarian perspective space colonization should be a chief goal as it would enable a very large population to live for a very long period of time possibly billions of years which would produce an enormous amount of utility or happiness he claims that it is more important to reduce existential risks to increase the probability of eventual colonization than to accelerate technological development so that space colonization could happen sooner in his paper he assumes that the created lives will have positive ethical value despite the problem of suffering.nin a 2001 interview with freeman dyson j richard gott and sid goldstein they were asked for reasons why some humans should live in space their answers were:nnngoalseditnalthough some items of the infrastructure requirements above can already be easily produced on earth and would therefore not be very valuable as trade items oxygen water base metal ores silicates etc other high value items are more abundant more easily produced of higher quality or can only be produced in space these would provide over the long-term a very high return on the initial investment in space infrastructure.nsome of these high-value trade goods include precious metals gemstones power solar cells ball bearings semi-conductors and pharmaceuticals.nthe mining and extraction of metals from a small asteroid the size of 3554 amun or 6178 1986 da both small near-earth asteroids would be 30 times as much metal as humans have mined throughout history a metal asteroid this size would be worth approximately us$20 trillion at 2001 market prices.nspace colonization is seen as a long-term goal of some national space programs since the advent of the 21st-century commercialization of space which saw greater cooperation between nasa and the private sector several private companies have announced plans toward the colonization of mars among entrepreneurs leading the call for space colonization are elon musk dennis tito and bas lansdorp.nthe main impediments to commercial exploitation of these resources are the very high cost of initial investment the very long period required for the expected return on those investments the eros project plans a 50-year development and the fact that the venture has never been carried out before the high-risk nature of the investment.nmajor governments and well-funded corporations have announced plans for new categories of activities space tourism and hotels prototype space-based solar-power satellites heavy-lift boosters and asteroid miningthat create needs and capabilities for humans to be present in space.nnmethodeditnbuilding colonies in space would require access to water food space people construction materials energy transportation communications life support simulated gravity radiation protection and capital investment it is likely the colonies would be located near the necessary physical resources the practice of space architecture seeks to transform spaceflight from a heroic test of human endurance to a normality within the bounds of comfortable experience as is true of other frontier-opening endeavors the capital investment necessary for space colonization would probably come from governments an argument made by john hickman and neil degrasse tyson.nnmaterialseditnfurther information asteroid miningncolonies on the moon mars or asteroids could extract local materials the moon is deficient in volatiles such as argon helium and compounds of carbon hydrogen and nitrogen the lcross impacter was targeted at the cabeus crater which was chosen as having a high concentration of water for the moon a plume of material erupted in which some water was detected mission chief scientist anthony colaprete estimated that the cabeus crater contains material with 1 water or possibly more water ice should also be in other permanently shadowed craters near the lunar poles although helium is present only in low concentrations on the moon where it is deposited into regolith by the solar wind an estimated million tons of he-3 exists over all it also has industrially significant oxygen silicon and metals such as iron aluminum and titanium.nlaunching materials from earth is expensive so bulk materials for colonies could come from the moon a near-earth object neo phobos or deimos the benefits of using such sources include a lower gravitational force no atmospheric drag on cargo vessels and no biosphere to damage many neos contain substantial amounts of metals underneath a drier outer crust much like oil shale some other neos are inactive comets which include billions of tons of water ice and kerogen hydrocarbons as well as some nitrogen compounds.nfarther out jupiters trojan asteroids are thought to be rich in water ice and other volatiles.nrecycling of some raw materials would almost certainly be necessary.nnenergyeditnsolar energy in orbit is abundant reliable and is commonly used to power satellites today there is no night in free space and no clouds or atmosphere to block sunlight light intensity obeys an inverse-square law so the solar energy available at distance d from the sun is e 1367/d w/m where d is measured in astronomical units au and 1367 watts/m is the energy available at the distance of earths orbit from the sun 1 au.nin the weightlessness and vacuum of space high temperatures for industrial processes can easily be achieved in solar ovens with huge parabolic reflectors made of metallic foil with very lightweight support structures flat mirrors to reflect sunlight around radiation shields into living areas to avoid line-of-sight access for cosmic rays or to make the suns image appear to move across their sky or onto crops are even lighter and easier to build.nlarge solar power photovoltaic cell arrays or thermal power plants would be needed to meet the electrical power needs of the settlers use in developed parts of earth electrical consumption can average 1 kilowatt/person or roughly 10 megawatt-hours per person per year these power plants could be at a short distance from the main structures if wires are used to transmit the power or much farther away with wireless power transmission.na major export of the initial space settlement designs was anticipated to be large solar power satellites that would use wireless power transmission phase-locked microwave beams or lasers emitting wavelengths that special solar cells convert with high efficiency to send power to locations on earth or to colonies on the moon or other locations in space for locations on earth this method of getting power is extremely benign with zero emissions and far less ground area required per watt than for conventional solar panels once these satellites are primarily built from lunar or asteroid-derived materials the price of sps electricity could be lower than energy from fossil fuel or nuclear energy replacing these would have significant benefits such as the elimination of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste from electricity generation.ntransmitting solar energy wirelessly from the earth to the moon and back is also an idea proposed for the benefit of space colonization and energy resources physicist dr david criswell who worked for nasa during the apollo missions came up with the idea of using power beams to transfer energy from space these beams microwaves with a wavelength of about 12 cm will be almost untouched as they travel through the atmosphere they can also be aimed at more industrial areas to keep away from humans or animal activities this will allow for safer and more reliable methods of transferring solar energy.nin 2008 scientists were able to send a 20 watt microwave signal from a mountain in maui to the island of hawaii since then jaxa and mitsubishi has teamed up on a 21 billion project in order to place satellites in orbit which could generate up to 1 gigawatt of energy these are the next advancements being done today in order to make energy be transmitted wirelessly for space-based solar energy.nhowever the value of sps power delivered wirelessly to other locations in space will typically be far higher than to earth otherwise the means of generating the power would need to be included with these projects and pay the heavy penalty of earth launch costs therefore other than proposed demonstration projects for power delivered to earth the first priority for sps electricity is likely to be locations in space such as communications satellites fuel depots or orbital tugboat boosters transferring cargo and passengers between low-earth orbit leo and other orbits such as geosynchronous orbit geo lunar orbit or highly-eccentric earth orbit heeo the system will also rely on satellites and receiving stations on earth to convert the energy into electricity because of this energy can be transmitted easily from dayside to nightside meaning power is reliable 24/7.nnuclear power is sometimes proposed for colonies located on the moon or on mars as the supply of solar energy is too discontinuous in these locations the moon has nights of two earth weeks in duration mars has nights relatively high gravity and an atmosphere featuring large dust storms to cover and degrade solar panels also mars greater distance from the sun 1.5 astronomical units au translates into e/1.5 2.25 only the solar energy of earth orbit another method would be transmitting energy wirelessly to the lunar or martian colonies from solar power satellites spss as described above the difficulties of generating power in these locations make the relative advantages of spss much greater there than for power beamed to locations on earth in order to also be able to fulfill the requirements of a moon base and energy to supply life support maintenance communications and research a combination of both nuclear and solar energy will be used in the first colonies.nfor both solar thermal and nuclear power generation in airless environments such as the moon and space and to a lesser extent the very thin martian atmosphere one of the main difficulties is dispersing the inevitable heat generated this requires fairly large radiator areas.nnlife supporteditnfurther information effect of spaceflight on the human body space medicine and space foodnin space settlements a life support system must recycle or import all the nutrients without crashing the closest terrestrial analogue to space life support is possibly that of a nuclear submarine nuclear submarines use mechanical life support systems to support humans for months without surfacing and this same basic technology could presumably be employed for space use however nuclear submarines run open loop"extracting oxygen from seawater and typically dumping carbon dioxide overboard although they recycle existing oxygen recycling of the carbon dioxide has been approached in the literature using the sabatier process or the bosch reaction.nalthough a fully mechanistic life support system is conceivable a closed ecological system is generally proposed for life support the biosphere 2 project in arizona has shown that a complex small enclosed man-made biosphere can support eight people for at least a year although there were many problems a year or so into the two-year mission oxygen had to be replenished which strongly suggests that they achieved atmospheric closure.nthe relationship between organisms their habitat and the non-earth environment can be:nnna combination of the above technologies is also possible.nnradiation protectioneditnsee also health threat from cosmic raysncosmic rays and solar flares create a lethal radiation environment in space in earth orbit the van allen belts make living above the earths atmosphere difficult to protect life settlements must be surrounded by sufficient mass to absorb most incoming radiation unless magnetic or plasma radiation shields were developed.npassive mass shielding of four metric tons per square meter of surface area will reduce radiation dosage to several msv or less annually well below the rate of some populated high natural background areas on earth this can be leftover material slag from processing lunar soil and asteroids into oxygen metals and other useful materials however it represents a significant obstacle to maneuvering vessels with such massive bulk mobile spacecraft being particularly likely to use less massive active shielding inertia would necessitate powerful thrusters to start or stop rotation or electric motors to spin two massive portions of a vessel in opposite senses shielding material can be stationary around a rotating interior.nnself-replicationeditnsee also von neumann probe clanking replicator and molecular nanotechnologynspace manufacturing could enable self-replication some think its the ultimate goal because it allows an exponential increase in colonies while eliminating costs to and dependence on earth it could be argued that the establishment of such a colony would be earths first act of self-replication intermediate goals include colonies that expect only information from earth science engineering entertainment and colonies that just require periodic supply of light weight objects such as integrated circuits medicines genetic material and tools.nnpsychological adjustmenteditnthe monotony and loneliness that comes from a prolonged space mission can leave astronauts susceptible to cabin fever or having a psychotic break moreover lack of sleep fatigue and work overload can affect an astronauts ability to perform well in an environment such as space where every action is critical.nnpopulation sizeeditnin 2002 the anthropologist john h moore estimated that a population of 150180 would permit a stable society to exist for 60 to 80 generations equivalent to 2000 years.na much smaller initial population of as little as two women should be viable as long as human embryos are available from earth use of a sperm bank from earth also allows a smaller starting base with negligible inbreeding.nresearchers in conservation biology have tended to adopt the 50/500 rule of thumb initially advanced by franklin and soule this rule says a short-term effective population size n of 50 is needed to prevent an unacceptable rate of inbreeding whereas a longterm n of 500 is required to maintain overall genetic variability the n 50 prescription corresponds to an inbreeding rate of 1 per generation approximately half the maximum rate tolerated by domestic animal breeders the n 500 value attempts to balance the rate of gain in genetic variation due to mutation with the rate of loss due to genetic drift.nassuming a journey of 6,300 years the astrophysicist frdric marin and the particle physicist camille beluffi calculated that the minimum viable population for a generation ship to reach proxima centauri would be 98 settlers at the beginning of the mission then the crew will breed until reaching a stable population of several hundred settlers within the ship nnmoney and currencyeditnexperts have debated on the possible usage of money and currencies in societies that will be established in space the quasi universal intergalactic denomination or quid is a physical currency made from a space-qualified polymer ptfe for inter-planetary travelers quid was designed for the foreign exchange company travelex by scientists from britains national space centre and the university of leicester some researchers have proposed the usage of cryptocurrencies for money transactions in space colonies since using physical money in space will be a costly process experts have explored the usage of blockchains to exchange value among inhabitants in a space colony.nnlocationeditn artist les bossinas 1989 concept of mars missionnlocation is a frequent point of contention between space colonization advocates the location of colonization can be on a physical body planet dwarf planet natural satellite or asteroid or orbiting one for colonies not on a body see also space habitat.nnnear-earth spaceeditnthe mooneditnmain article colonization of the moonndue to its proximity and familiarity earths moon is discussed as a target for colonization it has the benefits of proximity to earth and lower escape velocity allowing for easier exchange of goods and services a drawback of the moon is its low abundance of volatiles necessary for life such as hydrogen nitrogen and carbon water-ice deposits that exist in some polar craters could serve as a source for these elements an alternative solution is to bring hydrogen from near-earth asteroids and combine it with oxygen extracted from lunar rock.nthe moons low surface gravity is also a concern as it is unknown whether 1/6g is enough to maintain human health for long periods.nthe moons lack of atmosphere provides no protection from space radiation or meteoroids the early moon colonies may shelter in ancient lunar lava tubes to gain protection the two-week day/night cycle makes use of solar power more difficult.nnlagrange pointseditnmain article lagrange point colonizationn a contour plot of the gravitational potential of the sun and earth showing the five earthsun lagrange pointsnanother near-earth possibility are the five earthmoon lagrange points although they would generally also take a few days to reach with current technology many of these points would have near-continuous solar power because their distance from earth would result in only brief and infrequent eclipses of light from the sun however the fact that the earthmoon lagrange points l and l tend to collect dust and debris whereas l-l require active station-keeping measures to maintain a stable position make them somewhat less suitable places for habitation than was originally believed additionally the orbit of ll takes them out of the protection of the earths magnetosphere for approximately two-thirds of the time exposing them to the health threat from cosmic rays.nthe five earthsun lagrange points would totally eliminate eclipses but only l and l would be reachable in a few days time the other three earthsun points would require months to reach.nnother micro-g orbitseditnsee space habitatnnthe inner planetseditnmercuryeditnnncolonizing mercury would involve similar challenges as the moon as there are few volatile elements no atmosphere and the surface gravity is lower than earths however the planet also receives almost seven times the solar flux as the earth/moon system.ngeologist stephen gillett suggested in 1996 that this could make mercury an ideal place to build and launch solar sail spacecraft which could launch as folded up chunks by mass driver from mercurys surface once in space the solar sails would deploy since mercurys solar constant is 6.5 times higher than earths energy for the mass driver should be easy to come by and solar sails near mercury would have 6.5 times the thrust they do near earth this could make mercury an ideal place to acquire materials useful in building hardware to send to and terraform venus vast solar collectors could also be built on or near mercury to produce power for large scale engineering activities such as laser-pushed lightsails to nearby star systems.nnvenuseditnmain article colonization of venusn artists impression of a terraformed venusnmarseditnmain article colonization of marsnasteroid belteditnmain article colonization of the asteroidsnsee also asteroids explorationncolonization of asteroids would require space habitats the asteroid belt has significant overall material available the largest object being ceres although it is thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space unmanned supply craft should be practical with little technological advance even crossing 500 million kilometers of space the colonists would have a strong interest in assuring their asteroid did not hit earth or any other body of significant mass but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid of any size the orbits of the earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous momentum rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.nnmoons of outer planetseditnjovian moons europa callisto and ganymedeeditnmain articles colonization of europa and colonization of the outer solar systemnthe artemis project designed a plan to colonize europa one of jupiters moons scientists were to inhabit igloos and drill down into the europan ice crust exploring any sub-surface ocean this plan discusses possible use of air pockets for human habitation europa is considered one of the more habitable bodies in the solar system and so merits investigation as a possible abode for life.nnasa performed a study called hope revolutionary concepts for human outer planet exploration regarding the future exploration of the solar system the target chosen was callisto due to its distance from jupiter and thus the planets harmful radiation it could be possible to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the solar system.nthree of the galilean moons europa ganymede callisto have an abundance of volatiles that may support colonization efforts.nnmoons of saturn titan enceladus and otherseditnmain article colonization of titanntitan is suggested as a target for colonization because it is the only moon in the solar system to have a dense atmosphere and is rich in carbon-bearing compounds titan has ice water and large methane oceans robert zubrin identified titan as possessing an abundance of all the elements necessary to support life making titan perhaps the most advantageous locale in the outer solar system for colonization and saying in certain ways titan is the most hospitable extraterrestrial world within our solar system for human colonization".nenceladus is a small icy moon orbiting close to saturn notable for its extremely bright surface and the geyser-like plumes of ice and water vapor that erupt from its southern polar region if enceladus has liquid water it joins mars and jupiters moon europa as one of the prime places in the solar system to look for extraterrestrial life and possible future settlements.nother large satellites rhea iapetus dione tethys and mimas all have large quantities of volatiles which can be used to support settlements.nntrans-neptunian regioneditnmain article colonization of trans-neptunian objectsnthe kuiper belt is estimated to have 70,000 bodies of 100 km or larger.nfreeman dyson has suggested that within a few centuries human civilization will have relocated to the kuiper belt.nthe oort cloud is estimated to have up to a trillion comets.nnoutside the solar systemeditn a star forming region in the large magellanic cloudnlooking beyond the solar system there are up to several hundred billion potential stars with possible colonization targets the main difficulty is the vast distances to other stars roughly a hundred thousand times further away than the planets in the solar system this means that some combination of very high speed some percentage of the speed of light or travel times lasting centuries or millennia would be required these speeds are far beyond what current spacecraft propulsion systems can provide.nmany scientific papers have been published about interstellar travel given sufficient travel time and engineering work both unmanned and generational voyages seem possible though representing a very considerable technological and economic challenge unlikely to be met for some time particularly for manned probes.nspace colonization technology could in principle allow human expansion at high but sub-relativistic speeds substantially less than the speed of light c an interstellar colony ship would be similar to a space habitat with the addition of major propulsion capabilities and independent energy generation.nhypothetical starship concepts proposed both by scientists and in hard science fiction include:nnnthe above concepts all appear limited to high but still sub-relativistic speeds due to fundamental energy and reaction mass considerations and all would entail trip times which might be enabled by space colonization technology permitting self-contained habitats with lifetimes of decades to centuries yet human interstellar expansion at average speeds of even 0.1 of c would permit settlement of the entire galaxy in less than one half of a galactic rotation period of 250,000,000 years which is comparable to the timescale of other galactic processes thus even if interstellar travel at near relativistic speeds is never feasible which cannot be clearly determined at this time the development of space colonization could allow human expansion beyond the solar system without requiring technological advances that cannot yet be reasonably foreseen this could greatly improve the chances for the survival of intelligent life over cosmic timescales given the many natural and human-related hazards that have been widely noted.nif humanity does gain access to a large amount of energy on the order of the mass-energy of entire planets it may eventually become feasible to construct alcubierre drives these are one of the few methods of superluminal travel which may be possible under current physics however it is probable that such a device could never exist due to the fundamental challenges posed for more on this see difficulties of making and using an alcubierre drive.nnintergalactic traveleditnmain article intergalactic travelnlooking beyond the milky way there are at least 2 trillion other galaxies in the observable universe the distances between galaxies are on the order of a million times farther than those between the stars because of the speed of light limit on how fast any material objects can travel in space intergalactic travel would either have to involve voyages lasting millions of years or a possible faster than light propulsion method based on speculative physics such as the alcubierre drive there are however no scientific reasons for stating that intergalactic travel is impossible in principle.nneconomicseditnspace colonization can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become cheap enough such as space access by cheaper launch systems to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose in addition to estimated profits from commercial use of space.nalthough there are no immediate prospects for the large amounts of money required for space colonization to be available given traditional launch costs there is some prospect of a radical reduction to launch costs in the 2010s which would consequently lessen the cost of any efforts in that direction with a published price of us$56.5 million per launch of up to 13,150 kg 28,990 lb payload to low earth orbit spacex falcon 9 rockets are already the cheapest in the industry advancements currently being developed as part of the spacex reusable launch system development program to enable reusable falcon 9s could drop the price by an order of magnitude sparking more space-based enterprise which in turn would drop the cost of access to space still further through economies of scale if spacex is successful in developing the reusable technology it would be expected to have a major impact on the cost of access to space and change the increasingly competitive market in space launch services.nthe presidents commission on implementation of united states space exploration policy suggested that an inducement prize should be established perhaps by government for the achievement of space colonization for example by offering the prize to the first organization to place humans on the moon and sustain them for a fixed period before they return to earth.nnterrestrial analogues to space colonieseditnnthe most famous attempt to build an analogue to a self-sufficient colony is biosphere 2 which attempted to duplicate earths biosphere bios-3 is another closed ecosystem completed in 1972 in krasnoyarsk siberia.nmany space agencies build testbeds for advanced life support systems but these are designed for long duration human spaceflight not permanent colonization.nremote research stations in inhospitable climates such as the amundsenscott south pole station or devon island mars arctic research station can also provide some practice for off-world outpost construction and operation the mars desert research station has a habitat for similar reasons but the surrounding climate is not strictly inhospitable.nnhistoryeditnthe first known work on space colonization was the brick moon a work of fiction published in 1869 by edward everett hale about an inhabited artificial satellite.nthe russian schoolmaster and physicist konstantin tsiolkovsky foresaw elements of the space community in his book beyond planet earth written about 1900 tsiolkovsky had his space travelers building greenhouses and raising crops in space tsiolkovsky believed that going into space would help perfect human beings leading to immortality and peace.nothers have also written about space colonies as lasswitz in 1897 and bernal oberth von pirquet and noordung in the 1920s wernher von braun contributed his ideas in a 1952 colliers article in the 1950s and 1960s dandridge m cole published his ideas.nanother seminal book on the subject was the book the high frontier human colonies in space by gerard k oneill in 1977 which was followed the same year by colonies in space by t a heppenheimer.nm dyson wrote home on the moon living on a space frontier in 2003 peter eckart wrote lunar base handbook in 2006 and then harrison schmitts return to the moon written in 2007.nas of 2013 bigelow aerospace is the only private commercial spaceflight company that has launched two experimental space station modules genesis i 2006 and genesis ii 2007 into earth-orbit and has indicated that their first production model of the space habitat the ba 330 could be launched by 2017.nnplanetary protectioneditnsee also planetary protectionnrobotic spacecraft to mars are required to be sterilized to have at most 300,000 spores on the exterior of the craftand more thoroughly sterilized if they contact special regions containing water otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.nit is impossible to sterilize human missions to this level as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiome and these cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human containment seems the only option but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing i.e crash there have been several planetary workshops on this issue but with no final guidelines for a way forward yet human explorers would also be vulnerable to back contamination to earth if they become carriers of microorganisms.nnobjectionseditnna corollary to the fermi paradox"nobody else is doing it"is the argument that because no evidence of alien colonization technology exists it is statistically unlikely to even be possible to use that same level of technology ourselves.ncolonizing space would require massive amounts of financial physical and human capital devoted to research development production and deployment earths natural resources do not increase to a noteworthy extent which is in keeping with the only one earth position of environmentalists thus considerable efforts in colonizing places outside earth would appear as a hazardous waste of the earths limited resources for an aim without a clear end.nthe fundamental problem of public things needed for survival such as space programs is the free rider problem convincing the public to fund such programs would require additional self-interest arguments if the objective of space colonization is to provide a backup in case everyone on earth is killed then why should someone on earth pay for something that is only useful after they are dead this assumes that space colonization is not widely acknowledged as a sufficiently valuable social goal.nseen as a relief to the problem of overpopulation even as early as 1758 and listed as one of stephen hawkings reasons for pursuing space exploration it has become apparent that space colonisation in response to overpopulation is unwarranted indeed the birth rates of many developed countries specifically spacefaring ones are at or below replacement rates thus negating the need to use colonisation as a means of population control.nother objections include concerns that the forthcoming colonization and commodification of the cosmos may be likely to enhance the interests of the already powerful including major economic and military institutions e.g the large financial institutions the major aerospace companies and the militaryindustrial complex to lead to new wars and to exacerbate pre-existing exploitation of workers and resources economic inequality poverty social division and marginalization environmental degradation and other detrimental processes or institutions.nadditional concerns include creating a culture in which humans are no longer seen as human but rather as material assets the issues of human dignity morality philosophy culture bioethics and the threat of megalomaniac leaders in these new societies would all have to be addressed in order for space colonization to meet the psychological and social needs of people living in isolated colonies.nas an alternative or addendum for the future of the human race many science fiction writers have focused on the realm of the inner-space that is the computer-aided exploration of the human mind and human consciousnesspossibly en route developmentally to a matrioshka brain.nrobotic exploration is proposed as an alternative to gain many of the same scientific advantages without the limited mission duration and high cost of life support and return transportation involved in manned missions.nanother concern is the
