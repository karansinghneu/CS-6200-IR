paraguay.nnatural regionnthe gran chaco or dry chaco is a sparsely populated hot and semi-arid lowland natural region of the ro de la plata basin divided among easternnbolivia western paraguay northern argentina and a portion of the brazilian states of mato grosso and mato grosso do sul where it is connected with the pantanal region this land is sometimes called the chaco plain.nncontentsnnntoponymyeditnthe name chaco comes from a word in quechua an indigenous language from the andes and highlands of south america the quechua word chaqu meaning hunting land comes probably from the rich variety of animal life present throughout the entire region.nngeographyeditn a bulldozer clearing native forest in the chaco boreal and environmentalists campaigning against it alto chaco virgin forest in dry season bajo chaco extensive cattle ranching deforestation for cattle farming in the paraguayan part of the chaco nthe gran chaco is about 647,500 km 250,000 sq mi in size though estimates differ it is located west of the paraguay river and east of the andes and is mostly an alluvial sedimentary plain shared among paraguay bolivia and argentina it stretches from about 17 to 33 south latitude and between 65 and 60 west longitude though estimates differ.nhistorically the chaco has been divided in three main parts the chaco austral or southern chaco south of the bermejo river and inside argentinian territory blending into the pampa region in its southernmost end the chaco central or central chaco between the bermejo and the pilcomayo river to the north also now in argentinian territory and the chaco boreal or northern chaco north of the pilcomayo up to the brazilian pantanal inside paraguayan territory and sharing some area with bolivia.nlocals sometimes divide it today by the political borders giving rise to the terms argentinian chaco paraguayan chaco and bolivian chaco inside paraguay people sometimes use the expression central chaco for the area roughly in the middle of the chaco boreal where mennonite colonies are established.nthe chaco boreal may be divided in two closer to the mountains in the west the alto chaco upper chaco sometimes known as chaco seco or dry chaco is very dry and sparsely vegetated to the east less arid conditions combined with favorable soil characteristics permit a seasonally dry higher-growth thorn tree forest and further east still higher rainfall combined with improperly drained lowland soils result in a somewhat swampy plain called the bajo chaco lower chaco sometimes known as chaco hmedo humid chaco it has a more open savanna vegetation consisting of palm trees quebracho trees and tropical high-grass areas with a wealth of insects the landscape is mostly flat and slopes at a 0.004 degree gradient to the east this area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the parana-paraguay plain division.nthe areas more hospitable to development are along the paraguay bermejo and pilcomayo rivers it is a great source of timber and tannin which is derived from the native quebracho tree special tannin factories have been constructed there the wood of the palo santo from the central chaco is the source of oil of guaiac a fragrance for soap paraguay also cultivates mate in the lower part of the chaco.nlarge tracts of the central and northern chaco have high soil fertility sandy alluvial soils with elevated levels of phosphorus and a topography that is favorable for agricultural development other aspects are challenging for farming a semi-arid to semi-humid climate 6001300 mm annual rainfall with a six-month dry season and sufficient fresh groundwater restricted to roughly one third of the region two thirds being without groundwater or with groundwater of high salinity soils are generally erosion prone once the forest has been cleared in the central and northern paraguay chaco occasional dust storms have caused major top soil loss.nnhistoryeditnthe chaco was occupied by nomadic peoples notably the various groups making up the guaycuru who resisted spanish control often with success of the chaco from the 16th until the early 20th century nprior to national independence of the nations that compose the chaco the entire area was a separate colonial region named by the spaniards as chiquitos.nthe gran chaco had been a disputed territory since 1810 officially it was supposed to be part of argentina bolivia and paraguay although a bigger land portion west of the paraguay river had belonged to paraguay since its independence argentina claimed territories south of the bermejo river until paraguays defeat in the war of the triple alliance in 1870 established its current border with argentina.nover the next few decades bolivia began to push the natives out and settle in the gran chaco while paraguay ignored it bolivia sought the paraguay river for shipping oil out into the sea it had become a land-locked country after the loss of its pacific coast in the war of the pacific and paraguay claimed ownership of the land this became the backdrop to the gran chaco war 19321935 between paraguay and bolivia over supposed oil in the chaco boreal the aforementioned region north of the pilcomayo river and to the west of the paraguay river eventually argentine foreign minister carlos saavedra lamas mediated a cease fire and subsequent treaty signed in 1938 which gave paraguay three quarters of the chaco boreal and gave bolivia a corridor to the paraguay river with the ability to use the puerto casado and the right to construct their own port in the end no oil was found in the region.nn road construction in the deep gran chaco during the 1960s mennonites immigrated into the paraguayan part of the region from canada in the 1920s more came from the ussr in the 1930s and immediately following world war ii these immigrants created some of the largest and most prosperous municipalities in the deep gran chaco.nthe region is home to over nine million people divided about evenly among argentina bolivia brazil and including around 100,000 in paraguay the area remains relatively underdeveloped in the 1960s the paraguayan authorities constructed the trans-chaco highway and the argentine national highway directorate national routes 16 and 81 in an effort to encourage access and development all three highways extend about 700 km 430 mi from east to west and are now completely paved as are a network of nine brazilian highways in mato grosso do sul state.nnflora and faunaeditn an algarrobo white carob tree in the gran chaco area of argentina this prized shade tree is common to the area.nthe gran chaco has some of the highest temperatures on the continent nit has high biodiversity containing around 3,400 plant species 500 birds 150 mammals and 220 reptiles and amphibians.nthe floral characteristics of the gran chaco are varied given the large geographical span of the region the dominant vegetative structure is xerophytic deciduous forests with multiple layers including a canopy trees sub-canopy shrub layer and herbaceous layer there are ecosystems such as riverine forests wetlands savannas and cactus stands as well.nat higher elevations of the eastern zone of the humid/sub-humid chaco there are transitional mature forests from the wet forests of southern brazil these woodlands are dominated by canopy trees such as handroanthus impetiginosus and characterized by frequent lianas and epiphytes this declines to seasonally flooded forests at lower elevations that are dominated by schinopsis spp a common plains tree genus often harvested for its tannin content and dense wood the understory comprises bromeliad and cactus species as well as hardy shrubs like schinus fasciculatus these lower areas lack lianas but have abundant epiphytic species like tillandsia.nthe river systems that flow through the area such as the rio paraguay and rio parana allow for seasonally flooded semi evergreen gallery forests that hold riparian species such as tessaria integrifolia and salix humboltiana other seasonally flooded ecosystems of this area include palm dominated copernicia alba savannas with a bunch grass dominated herbaceous layer.nto the west in the semi-arid/arid chaco there are medium-sized forests consisting of aspidosperma quebracho-blanco and schinopsis quebracho with a slightly shorter subcanopy made up of several species from the fabaceae family as well as several arboreal cacti species that distinguish this area of the chaco there is a scrub-like shrub and herbaceous layer on sandy soils the thick woodlands turn into savannas where the aforementioned species prevail as well as species like jacaranda mimosifolia the giant stetsonia coryne found throughout the western semi-arid/arid region becomes very conspicuous in these sandy savannas nthere are various upland systems of plant associations that occur throughout the gran chaco the highlands of the argentinian chaco are made up of on the dry sunny side up to 1800m schinopsis haenkeana woodlands the cooler side of the uplands hosts zanthoxylum coco locally referred to as fagara coco and schinus molleoides locally referred to as lithrea molleoides as the predominant species other notable species include bougainvillea stipitata and several spp from fabaceae the paraguyan uplands have other woodland slope ecosystems notably those dominated by anadenanthera colubrina on moist slopes both of these upland systems as well as numerous other gran chaco areas are rich with endemism.nfaunal diversity in the gran chaco is high as well.the gran chaco has high levels of biodiversity containing around 3,400 plant species 500 birds 150 mammals and 220 reptiles and amphibians animals typically associated with tropical and subtropical forests are often found throughout the eastern humid chaco including jaguars howler monkeys peccaries deer and tapirs edentate species including anteaters and armadillos are readily seen here as well being home to at least ten species the argentinian chaco is the location of the peak diversity for the armadillo including species such as the nine-banded armadillo dasypus novemcinctus whose range extends north to the southern us and the southern three-banded armadillo tolypeutes matacus the pink fairy armadillo chlamyphrous truncatus is found nowhere else in the world the giant armadillo priodontes maximus while not found in the eastern humid chaco can be seen in the drier arid chaco of the west some other notable endemics of the region include the san luis tuco-tuco ctenomys pontifex this small rodent is only found in the argentinian chaco all of 60 species of ctenomys are endemic to the continent of south america the chacoan peccary catagonus wagneri locally known as tauga is the largest of the three peccary species found in the area this species was thought to be extinct by scientists until 1975 when it was recorded by dr ralph wetzel.ndue to the climatic regime of the gran chaco herpetofauna are restricted to moist refugia in various places throughout the chaco rotting logs debris piles old housing settlement wells and seasonal farm ponds are examples of such refugia nthe black-legged seriema chunga burmeisteri blue-crowned parakeet aratinga acuticadauta picui ground dove columbina picui guira cuckoo guira guira little thornbird phacellodomus sibilatrix and many-colored chaco finch saltaitricula multicolor are notable of the 409 bird species that are resident or breed in the gran chaco 252 of these chaco species are endemic to south america.nin september 1995 the kaa-iya del gran chaco national park and integrated management natural area was established in an area of the chaco in bolivia it is administered and was established solely by the indigenous peoples including the izoceo guaran the ayoreode and the chiquitano.nnconservation issueseditn sorghum harvest 2008 linea 14 agua dulce region alto paraguaynthe chaco is one of south americas last agricultural frontiers very sparsely populated and lacking sufficient all-weather roads and basic infrastructure the argentinian part is more developed than the paraguayan or bolivian part it has long been too remote for crop planting the central chacos mennonite colonies are a notable exception.ntwo factors may substantially change the chaco in the near
