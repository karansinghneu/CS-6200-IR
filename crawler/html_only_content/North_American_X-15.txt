operated by the united states air force and the national aeronautics and space administration as part of the x-plane series of experimental aircraft the x-15 set speed and altitude records in the 1960s reaching the edge of outer space and returning with valuable data used in aircraft and spacecraft design the x-15s official world record for the highest speed ever recorded by a manned powered aircraft set in october 1967 when william j knight flew mach 6.70 at 102,100 feet 31,120 m a speed of 4,520 miles per hour 7,274 km/h 2,021 m/s has remained unbroken as of 2017.nduring the x-15 program 13 flights by eight pilots met the air force spaceflight criterion by exceeding the altitude of 50 miles 80 km thus qualifying these pilots as being astronauts the air force pilots qualified for astronaut wings immediately while the civilian pilots were eventually awarded nasa astronaut wings in 2005 35 years after the last x-15 flight the only navy pilot in the x-15 program never took the aircraft above the requisite 50 mile 80 km altitude and thus never earned astronaut wings.nncontentsnnndesign and developmenteditn x-15 after igniting rocket enginen x-15a-2 with sealed ablative coating external fuel tanks and ramjet dummy testnthe x-15 was based on a concept study from walter dornberger for the national advisory committee for aeronautics naca for a hypersonic research aircraft the requests for proposal rfps were published on 30 december 1954 for the airframe and on 4 february 1955 for the rocket engine the x-15 was built by two manufacturers north american aviation was contracted for the airframe in november 1955 and reaction motors was contracted for building the engines in 1956.nlike many x-series aircraft the x-15 was designed to be carried aloft and drop launched from under the wing of a b-52 mother ship air force nb-52a the high and mighty one serial 52-0003 and nb-52b the challenger serial 52-0008 a.k.a balls 8 served as carrier planes for all x-15 flights release took place at an altitude of about 8.5 miles 13.7 km and a speed of about 500 miles per hour 805 km/h the x-15 fuselage was long and cylindrical with rear fairings that flattened its appearance and thick dorsal and ventral wedge-fin stabilizers parts of the fuselage were heat-resistant nickel alloy inconel-x 750 the retractable landing gear comprised a nose-wheel carriage and two rear skids the skids did not extend beyond the ventral fin which required the pilot to jettison the lower fin just before landing the lower fin was recovered by parachute.nncockpit and pilot systemseditn cockpit of an x-15nthe x-15 was the product of developmental research and changes were made to various systems over the course of the program and between the different models the x-15 was operated under several different scenarios including attachment to a launch aircraft drop main engine start and acceleration ballistic flight into thin air/space re-entry into thicker air unpowered glide to landing and direct landing without a main-engine start the main rocket engine operated only for a relatively short part of the flight but boosted the x-15 to its high speeds and altitudes without main engine thrust the x-15s instruments and control surfaces remained functional but the aircraft could not maintain altitude.nbecause the x-15 also had to be controlled in an environment where there was too little air for aerodynamic flight control surfaces it had a reaction control system rcs that used rocket thrusters there were two different x-15 pilot control setups one used three joysticks the other one joystick.nthe x-15 type with multiple control sticks for the pilot placed a traditional rudder and stick between a left joystick that sent commands to the reaction control system and a third joystick on the right used during high-g maneuvers to augment the center stick in addition to pilot input the x-15 stability augmentation system sas sent inputs to the aerodynamic controls to help the pilot maintain attitude control the reaction control system rcs could be operated in two modes manual and automatic the automatic mode used a feature called reaction augmentation system ras that helped stabilize the vehicle at high altitude the ras was typically used for approximately three minutes of an x-15 flight before automatic power off.nthe alternative control setup used the mh-96 flight control system which allowed one joystick in place of three and simplified pilot input the mh-96 could automatically blend aerodynamic and rocket controls depending on how effective each system was at controlling the aircraft.namong the many controls were the rocket engine throttle and a control for jettisoning the ventral tail fin other features of the cockpit included heated windows to prevent icing and a forward headrest for periods of high deceleration.nthe x-15 had an ejection seat designed to operate at speeds up to mach 4 4,480 km/h 2,784 mph and/or 120,000 feet 37 km altitude although it was never used during the program in the event of ejection the seat was designed to deploy fins which were used until it reached a safer speed/altitude at which to deploy its main parachute pilots wore pressure suits which could be pressurized with nitrogen gas above 35,000 feet 11 km altitude the cockpit was pressurized to 3.5 psi 0.24 atm with nitrogen gas while oxygen for breathing was fed separately to the pilot.nnpropulsioneditn x-15 tail with xlr-99nthe initial 24 powered flights used two reaction motors xlr11 liquid-propellant rocket engines enhanced to provide a total of 16,000 pounds-force 71 kn of thrust as compared to the 6,000 pounds-force 27 kn that a single xlr11 provided in 1947 to make the bell x-1 the first aircraft to fly faster than the speed of sound the xlr11 used ethyl alcohol and liquid oxygen.nby november 1960 reaction motors was able to deliver the xlr99 rocket engine generating 57,000 pounds-force 250 kn of thrust the remaining 175 flights of the x-15 used xlr99 engines in a single engine configuration the xlr99 used anhydrous ammonia and liquid oxygen as propellant and hydrogen peroxide to drive the high-speed turbopump that delivered propellants to the engine it could burn 15,000 pounds 6,804 kg of propellant in 80 seconds jules bergman titled his book on the program ninety seconds to space to describe the total powered flight time of the aircraft.nthe x-15 reaction control system rcs for maneuvering in low-pressure/density environment used high-test peroxide htp which decomposes into water and oxygen in the presence of a catalyst and could provide a specific impulse of 140 seconds the htp also fueled a turbopump for the main engines and auxiliary power units apus additional tanks for helium and liquid nitrogen performed other functions for example the fuselage interior was purged with helium gas and the liquid nitrogen was used as coolant for various systems.nnwedge tail and hypersonic stabilityeditn x-15 attached to its b-52 mother ship with a t-38 flying nearbynthe x-15 had a thick wedge tail to enable it to fly in a steady manner at hypersonic speeds this produced a significant amount of drag at lower speeds the blunt end at the rear of the x-15 could produce as much drag as an entire f-104 starfighter.nna wedge shape was used because it is more effective than the conventional tail as a stabilizing surface at hypersonic speeds a vertical-tail area equal to 60 percent of the wing area was required to give the x-15 adequate directional stability wendell h stillwell x-15 research results sp-60nnstability at hypersonic speeds was aided by side panels which could be extended from the tail to increase the overall surface area and these panels doubled as air-brakes.nnoperational historyeditn neil armstrong with x-15 number 1n x-15 pilots as of december 1965 left to right joe engle bob rushworth john mckay pete knight milt thompson and bill

among manned rocket-powered aircraft becoming the worlds first operational spaceplane in the early 1960s.nbefore 1958 united states air force usaf and naca officials discussed an orbital x-15 spaceplane the x-15b that would launch into outer space from atop an sm-64 navaho missile this was canceled when the naca became nasa and adopted project mercury instead.nby 1959 the boeing x-20 dyna-soar space-glider program was to become the usafs preferred means for launching military manned spacecraft into orbit this program was canceled in the early 1960s before an operational vehicle could be built various configurations of the navajo were considered and another proposal involved a titan i stage.nthree x-15s were built flying 199 test flights the last on 24 october 1968.nthe first x-15 flight was an unpowered glide flight by scott crossfield on 8 june 1959 crossfield also piloted the first powered flight on 17 september 1959 and his first flight with the xlr-99 rocket engine on 15 november 1960 twelve test pilots flew the x-15 among these were neil armstrong later a nasa astronaut and first man to set foot on the moon and joe engle later a commander of nasa space shuttle missions.nin a 1962 proposal nasa considered using the b-52/x-15 as a launch platform for a blue scout rocket to place satellites weighing up to 150 pounds 68 kg into orbit.nin july and august 1963 pilot joseph a walker exceeded 100 km in altitude joining nasa astronauts and soviet cosmonauts as the first human beings to cross that line on their way to outer space the usaf awarded astronaut wings to anyone achieving an altitude of 50 miles 80 km while the fai set the limit of space at 100 kilometers 62.1 mi.non 15 november 1967 u.s air force test pilot major michael j adams was killed during x-15 flight 191 when x-15-3 af ser no 56-6672 entered a hypersonic spin while descending then oscillated violently as aerodynamic forces increased after re-entry as his aircrafts flight control system operated the control surfaces to their limits acceleration built to 15 g 150 m/s vertical and 8.0 g 78 m/s lateral the airframe broke apart at 60,000 feet 18 km altitude scattering the x-15s wreckage for 50 square miles 130 km on 8 may 2004 a monument was erected at the cockpits locale near randsburg california major adams was posthumously awarded air force astronaut wings for his final flight in x-15-3 which had reached an altitude of 50.4 miles 81.1 km in 1991 his name was added to the astronaut memorial.nthe second plane x-15-2 was rebuilt after a landing accident on 9 november 1962 which damaged the craft and injured its pilot john mckay it was lengthened by 2.4 feet 73 cm had a pair of auxiliary fuel tanks attached beneath its fuselage and wings and a complete heat-resistant ablative coating was added the plane was renamed the x-15a-2 and took flight for the first time on 25 june 1964 it reached its maximum speed of 4,520 miles per hour 7,274 km/h in october 1967 with pilot william pete knight of the u.s air force in control.nfive principal aircraft were used during the x-15 program three x-15 planes and two modified nonstandard nb-52 bombers:nnnadditionally f-100 f-104 and f5d chase aircraft and c-130 and c-47 transports supported the program.na 200th flight over nevada was first scheduled for 21 november 1968 to be flown by william pete knight numerous technical problems and outbreaks of bad weather delayed this proposed flight six times and it was permanently canceled on 20 december 1968 this x-15 was detached from the b-52 and then put into indefinite storage the aircraft was later donated to the air force museum at wright-patterson air force base for display.nnncurrent static displayseditn x-15 at the national air
