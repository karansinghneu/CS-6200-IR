kingdom of macedon and a member of the argead dynasty he was born in pella in 356 bc and succeeded his father philip ii to the throne at the age of 20 he spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through asia and northeast africa and he created one of the largest empires of the ancient world by the age of thirty stretching from greece to northwestern india he

336 bc he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army alexander was awarded the generalship of greece and used this authority to launch his fathers pan-hellenic project to lead the greeks in the conquest of persia in 334 bc he invaded the achaemenid empire persian empire and began a series of campaigns that lasted 10 years following the conquest of anatolia alexander broke the power of persia in a series of decisive battles most notably the battles of issus and gaugamela he subsequently overthrew persian king darius iii and conquered the achaemenid empire in its entirety at that point his empire stretched from the adriatic sea to the indus river.nhe endeavored to reach the ends of the world and the great outer sea and invaded india in 326 bc winning an important victory over the pauravas at the battle of the hydaspes he eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops alexander died in babylon in 323 bc the city that he planned to establish as his capital without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of arabia in the years following his death a series of civil wars tore his empire apart resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the diadochi alexanders surviving generals and heirs.nalexanders legacy includes the cultural diffusion and syncretism which his conquests engendered such as greco-buddhism he founded some twenty cities that bore his name most notably alexandria in egypt alexanders settlement of greek colonists and the resulting spread of greek culture in the east resulted in a new hellenistic civilization aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the byzantine empire in the mid-15th century ad and the presence of greek speakers in central and far eastern anatolia until the 1920s alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of achilles and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of

the most influential people in history.nncontentsnnnnearly lifenlineage and childhoodn bust of a young alexander the great from the hellenistic era british museumn aristotle tutoring alexander by jean leon gerome ferrisnalexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient greek month of hekatombaion which probably corresponds to 20 july 356 bc although the exact date is disputed in pella the capital of the kingdom of macedon he was the son of the king of macedon philip ii and his fourth wife olympias the daughter of neoptolemus i king of epirus although philip had seven or eight wives olympias was his principal wife for some time likely because she gave birth to alexander.nn statue of alexander the great in thessaloniki macedonia greecenseveral legends surround alexanders birth and childhood according to the ancient greek biographer plutarch on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to philip olympias dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt that caused a flame to spread far and wide before dying away sometime after the wedding philip is said to have seen himself in a dream securing his wifes womb with a seal engraved with a lions image plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams that olympias was pregnant before her marriage indicated by the sealing of her womb or that alexanders father was zeus ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious olympias promulgated the story of alexanders divine parentage variously claiming that she had told alexander or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.non the day alexander was born philip was preparing a siege on the city of potidea on the peninsula of chalcidice that same day philip received news that his general parmenion had defeated the combined illyrian and paeonian armies and that his horses had won at the olympic games it was also said that on this day the temple of artemis in ephesus one of the seven wonders of the world burnt down this led hegesias of magnesia to say that it had burnt down because artemis was away attending the birth of alexander such legends may have emerged when alexander was king and possibly at his own instigation to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.nin his early years alexander was raised by a nurse lanike sister of alexanders future general cleitus the black later in his childhood alexander was tutored by the strict leonidas a relative of his mother and by lysimachus of acarnania alexander was raised in the manner of noble macedonian youths learning to read play the lyre ride fight and hunt.nwhen alexander was ten years old a trader from thessaly brought philip a horse which he offered to sell for thirteen talents the horse refused to be mounted and philip ordered it away alexander however detecting the horses fear of its own shadow asked to tame the horse which he eventually managed plutarch stated that philip overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition kissed his son tearfully declaring my boy you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions macedon is too small for you and bought the horse for him alexander named it bucephalas meaning ox-head bucephalas carried alexander as far as india when the animal died because of old age according to plutarch at age thirty alexander named a city after him bucephala.nneducationnwhen alexander was 13 philip began to search for a tutor and considered such academics as isocrates and speusippus the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the academy to take up the post in the end philip chose aristotle and provided the temple of the nymphs at mieza as a classroom in return for teaching alexander philip agreed to rebuild aristotles hometown of stageira which philip had razed and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves or pardoning those who were in exile.nmieza was like a boarding school for alexander and the children of macedonian nobles such as ptolemy hephaistion and cassander many of these students would become his friends and future generals and are often known as the companions aristotle taught alexander and his companions about medicine philosophy morals religion logic and art under aristotles tutelage alexander developed a passion for the works of homer and in particular the iliad aristotle gave him an annotated copy which alexander later carried on his campaigns.nnphilips heirnregency and ascent of macedonnmain articles philip ii of macedon and rise of macedonnfurther information history of macedonia ancient kingdomn philip ii of macedon alexanders fathernat age 16 alexanders education under aristotle ended philip waged war against byzantion leaving alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent during philips absence the thracian maedi revolted against macedonia alexander responded quickly driving them from their territory he colonized it with greeks and founded a city named alexandropolis.nupon philips return he dispatched alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern thrace campaigning against the greek city of perinthus alexander is reported to have saved his fathers life meanwhile the city of amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to apollo near delphi a sacrilege that gave philip the opportunity to further intervene in greek affairs still occupied in thrace he ordered alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern greece concerned that other greek states might intervene alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack illyria instead during this turmoil the illyrians invaded macedonia only to be repelled by alexander.nphilip and his army joined his son in 338 bc and they marched south through thermopylae taking it after stubborn resistance from its theban garrison they went on to occupy the city of elatea only a few days march from both athens and thebes the athenians led by demosthenes voted to seek alliance with thebes against macedonia both athens and philip sent embassies to win thebes favour but athens won the contest philip marched on amphissa ostensibly acting on the request of the amphictyonic league capturing the mercenaries sent there by demosthenes and accepting the citys surrender philip then returned to elatea sending a final offer of peace to athens and thebes who both rejected it.nn statue of alexander in istanbul archaeology museumnas philip marched south his opponents blocked him near chaeronea boeotia during the ensuing battle of chaeronea philip commanded the right wing and alexander the left accompanied by a group of philips trusted generals according to the ancient sources the two sides fought bitterly for some time philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat counting on the untested athenian hoplites to follow thus breaking their line alexander was the first to break the theban lines followed by philips generals having damaged the enemys cohesion philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them with the athenians lost the thebans were surrounded left to fight alone they were defeated.nafter the victory at chaeronea philip and alexander marched unopposed into the peloponnese welcomed by all cities however when they reached sparta they were refused but did not resort to war at corinth philip established a hellenic alliance modelled on the old anti-persian alliance of the greco-persian wars which included most greek city-states except sparta philip was then named hegemon often translated as supreme commander of this league known by modern scholars as the league of corinth and announced his plans to attack the persian empire.nnexile and returnnwhen philip returned to pella he fell in love with and married cleopatra eurydice in 338 bc the niece of his general attalus the marriage made alexanders position as heir less secure since any son of cleopatra eurydice would be a fully macedonian heir while alexander was only half-macedonian during the wedding banquet a drunken attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.nnat the wedding of cleopatra whom philip fell in love with and married she being much too young for him her uncle attalus in his drink desired the macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece this so irritated alexander that throwing one of the cups at his head you villain said he what am i then a bastard then philip taking attaluss part rose up and would have run his son through but by good fortune for them both either his over-hasty rage or the wine he had drunk made his foot slip so that he fell down on the floor at which alexander reproachfully insulted over him see there said he the man who makes preparations to pass out of europe into asia overturned in passing from one seat to another plutarch describing the feud at philips wedding.nnalexander fled macedon with his mother dropping her off with her brother king alexander i of epirus in dodona capital of the molossians he continued to illyria where he sought refuge with the illyrian king and was treated as a guest despite having defeated them in battle a few years before however it appears philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son accordingly alexander returned to macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend demaratus who mediated between the two parties.nin the following year the persian satrap governor of caria pixodarus offered his eldest daughter to alexanders half-brother philip arrhidaeus olympias and several of alexanders friends suggested this showed philip intended to make arrhidaeus his heir alexander reacted by sending an actor thessalus of corinth to tell pixodarus that he should not offer his daughters hand to an illegitimate son but instead to alexander when philip heard of this he stopped the negotiations and scolded alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a carian explaining that he wanted a better bride for him philip exiled four of alexanders friends harpalus nearchus ptolemy and erigyius and had the corinthians bring thessalus to him in chains.nnking of

was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguards pausanias as pausanias tried to escape he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers including two of alexanders companions perdiccas and leonnatus alexander was proclaimed king on the spot by the nobles and army at the age of 20.nnconsolidation of powernalexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne he had his cousin the former amyntas iv executed he also had two macedonian princes from the region of lyncestis killed but spared a third alexander lyncestes olympias had cleopatra eurydice and europa her daughter by philip burned alive when alexander learned about this he was furious alexander also ordered the murder of attalus who was in command of the advance guard of the army in asia minor and cleopatras uncle.nattalus was at that time corresponding with demosthenes regarding the possibility of defecting to athens attalus also had severely insulted alexander and following cleopatras murder alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive alexander spared arrhidaeus who was by all accounts mentally disabled possibly as a result of poisoning by olympias.nnews of philips death roused many states into revolt including thebes athens thessaly and the thracian tribes north of macedon when news of the revolts reached alexander he responded quickly though advised to use diplomacy alexander mustered 3,000 macedonian cavalry and rode south towards thessaly he found the thessalian army occupying the pass between mount olympus and mount ossa and ordered his men to ride over mount ossa when the thessalians awoke the next day they found alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered adding their cavalry to alexanders force he then continued south towards the peloponnese.nalexander stopped at thermopylae where he was recognized as the leader of the amphictyonic league before heading south to corinth athens sued for peace and alexander pardoned the rebels the famous encounter between alexander and diogenes the cynic occurred during alexanders stay in corinth when alexander asked diogenes what he could do for him the philosopher disdainfully asked alexander to stand a little to the side as he was blocking the sunlight this reply apparently delighted alexander who is reported to have said but verily if i were not alexander i would like to be diogenes at corinth alexander took the title of hegemon leader and like philip was appointed commander for the coming war against persia he also received news of a thracian uprising.nnbalkan

attacked and defeated the thracian forces manning the heights the macedonians marched into the country of the triballi and defeated their army near the lyginus river a tributary of the danube alexander then marched for three days to the danube encountering the getae tribe on the opposite shore crossing the river at night he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry skirmish.nnews then reached alexander that cleitus king of illyria and king glaukias of the taulantii were in open revolt against his authority marching west into illyria alexander defeated each in turn forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops with these victories he secured his northern frontier.nwhile alexander campaigned north the thebans and athenians rebelled once again alexander immediately headed south while the other cities again hesitated thebes decided to fight the theban resistance was ineffective and alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other boeotian cities the end of thebes cowed athens leaving all of greece temporarily at peace alexander then set out on his asian campaign leaving antipater as regent.nnmaps of

thrace paionia and illyria he showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the persian empire by throwing a spear into asian soil and saying he accepted asia as a gift from the gods this also showed alexanders eagerness to fight in contrast to his fathers preference for diplomacy.nafter an initial victory against persian forces at the battle of the granicus alexander accepted the surrender of the persian provincial capital and treasury of sardis he then proceeded along the ionian coast granting autonomy and democracy to the cities miletus held by achaemenid forces required a delicate siege operation with persian naval forces nearby further south at halicarnassus in caria alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege eventually forcing his opponents the mercenary captain memnon of rhodes and the persian satrap of caria orontobates to withdraw by sea alexander left the government of caria to a member of the hecatomnid dynasty ada who adopted alexander.nfrom halicarnassus alexander proceeded into mountainous lycia and the pamphylian plain asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the persians naval bases from pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and alexander moved inland at termessos alexander humbled but did not storm the pisidian city at the ancient phrygian capital of gordium alexander undid the hitherto unsolvable gordian

already lost and a ransom of 10,000 talents for his family alexander replied that since he was now king of asia it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.nalexander proceeded to take

unsuccessful assaults the stronghold fell but not before alexander had received a serious shoulder wound as in tyre men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.nalexander advanced on egypt in later 332 bc where he was regarded as a liberator he was pronounced son of the deity amun at the oracle of siwa oasis in the libyan desert henceforth alexander

mountains which had been blocked by a persian army under ariobarzanes and then hurried to persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.non entering persepolis alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days alexander stayed in persepolis for five months during his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of xerxes i and spread to the rest of the city possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the acropolis of athens during the second persian war by xerxes even as he watched the city burn alexander immediately began to regret his decision plutarch claims that he ordered his men to put out the fires but that the flames had already spread to most of the city curtius claims that alexander did not regret his decision until the next morning plutarch recounts an anecdote in which alexander pauses and talks to a fallen statue of xerxes as if it were a live person:nnshall i pass by and leave you lying there because of the expeditions you led against greece or shall i set you up again because of your magnanimity and your virtues in other respects?nnfall of the empire and the eastn a contemporary depiction of

and was taken prisoner by bessus his bactrian satrap and kinsman as alexander approached bessus had his men fatally stab the great king and then declared himself darius successor as artaxerxes v before retreating into central asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against alexander alexander buried darius remains next to his achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral he claimed that while dying darius had named him as his successor to the achaemenid throne the achaemenid empire is normally considered to have fallen with darius.nalexander viewed bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him this campaign initially against bessus turned into a grand tour of central asia alexander founded a series of new cities all called alexandria including modern kandahar in afghanistan and alexandria eschate the furthest in modern tajikistan the campaign took alexander through media parthia aria west afghanistan drangiana arachosia south and central afghanistan bactria north and central afghanistan and scythia.nspitamenes who held an undefined position in the satrapy of sogdiana in 329 bc betrayed bessus to ptolemy one of alexanders trusted companions and bessus was executed however when at some point later alexander was on the jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army spitamenes raised sogdiana in revolt alexander personally defeated the scythians at the battle of jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against spitamenes defeating him in the battle of gabai after the defeat spitamenes was killed by his own men who then sued for peace.nnproblems and plotsn the killing of cleitus by andr castaigne 18981899nduring this time alexander adopted some elements of persian dress and customs at his court notably the custom of proskynesis either a symbolic kissing of the hand or prostration on the ground that persians showed to their social superiors the greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it this cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen and he eventually abandoned it.na plot against his life was revealed and one of his officers philotas was executed for failing to alert alexander the death of the son necessitated the death of the father and thus parmenion who had been charged with guarding the treasury at ecbatana was assassinated at alexanders command to prevent attempts at vengeance most infamously alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at granicus cleitus the black during a violent drunken altercation at maracanda modern day samarkand in uzbekistan in which cleitus accused alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially of having forgotten the macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.nlater in the central asian campaign a second plot against his life was revealed this one instigated by his own royal pages his official historian callisthenes of olynthus was implicated in the plot and in the anabasis of alexander arrian states that callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment and likely died soon after it remains unclear if callisthenes was actually involved in the plot for prior to his accusation he had fallen out of favour by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.nnmacedon in alexanders absencenwhen alexander set out for asia he left his general antipater an experienced military and political leader and part of philip iis old guard in charge of macedon alexanders sacking of thebes ensured that greece remained quiet during his absence the one exception was a call to arms by spartan king agis iii in 331 bc whom antipater defeated and killed in the battle of megalopolis antipater referred the spartans punishment to the league of corinth which then deferred to alexander who chose to pardon them there was also considerable friction between antipater and olympias and each complained to alexander about the other.nin general greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during alexanders campaign in asia alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire however alexanders constant demands for troops and the migration of macedonians throughout his empire depleted macedons strength greatly weakening it in the years after alexander and ultimately led to its subjugation by rome after the third macedonian war 171168 bc.nnindian campaignnmain article indian campaign of alexander the greatnforays into the indian subcontinentn the phalanx attacking the

cement relations with his new satrapies alexander turned to the indian subcontinent he invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of gandhara a region presently straddling eastern afghanistan and northern pakistan to come to him and submit to his authority omphis indian name ambhi the ruler of taxila whose kingdom extended from the indus to the hydaspes jhelum complied but the chieftains of some hill clans including the aspasioi and assakenoi sections of the kambojas known in indian texts also as ashvayanas and ashvakayanas refused to submit ambhi hastened to relieve alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents placing himself and all his forces at his disposal alexander not only returned ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of persian robes gold and silver ornaments 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold alexander was emboldened to divide his forces and ambhi assisted hephaestion and perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the indus where it bends at hund fox 1973 supplied their troops with provisions and received alexander himself and his whole army in his capital city of taxila with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.non the subsequent advance of the macedonian king taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the battle of the hydaspes river after that victory he was sent by alexander in pursuit of porus to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy subsequently however the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of alexander and taxiles after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the hydaspes was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the indus a considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of philip son of machatas and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of alexander himself 323 bc as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at triparadisus 321 bc.nin the winter of 327/326 bc alexander personally led a campaign against the aspasioi of kunar valleys the guraeans of the guraeus valley and the assakenoi of the swat and buner valleys a fierce contest ensued with the aspasioi in which alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the aspasioi lost alexander then faced the assakenoi who fought against him from the strongholds of massaga ora and aornos.nthe fort of massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting in which alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle according to curtius not only did alexander slaughter the entire population of massaga but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble a similar slaughter followed at ora in the aftermath of massaga and ora numerous assakenians fled to the fortress of aornos alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.nafter aornos alexander crossed the indus and fought and won an epic battle against king porus who ruled a region lying between the hydaspes and the acesines chenab in what is now the punjab in the battle of the hydaspes in 326 bc alexander was impressed by porus bravery and made him an ally he appointed porus as satrap and added to porus territory land that he did not previously own towards the south-east up to the hyphasis beas choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from greece alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the hydaspes river naming one bucephala in honour of his horse who died around this time the other was nicaea victory thought to be located at the site of modern-day mong punjab.nnrevolt of the armyn asia in 323 bc the nanda

beas refusing to march farther east this river thus marks the easternmost extent of alexanders conquests.nnas for the macedonians however their struggle with porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into india for having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse they violently opposed alexander when he insisted on crossing the river ganges also the width of which as they learned was thirty-two furlongs its depth a hundred fathoms while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of men-at-arms and horsemen and elephants for they were told that the kings of the ganderites and praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen two hundred thousand footmen eight thousand chariots and six thousand war elephants.nnalexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther but his general coenus pleaded with him to change his opinion and return the men he said longed to again see their parents their wives and children their homeland alexander eventually agreed and turned south marching along the indus along the way his army conquered the malhi in modern-day multan and other indian tribes and alexander sustained an injury during the siege.nalexander sent much of his army to carmania modern southern iran with general craterus and commissioned a fleet to explore the persian gulf shore under his admiral nearchus while he led the rest back to persia through the more difficult southern route along the gedrosian desert and makran alexander reached susa in 324 bc but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.nnlast years in persian alexander left and hephaestion rightndiscovering that many of his satraps and military governors had misbehaved in his

back to macedon led by craterus his troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of opis they refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of persian customs and dress and the introduction of persian officers and soldiers into macedonian units.nn alexander at the tomb of cyrus the great by pierre-henri de valenciennes 1796nafter three days unable to persuade his men to back down alexander gave persians command posts in the army and conferred macedonian military titles upon persian units the macedonians quickly begged forgiveness which alexander accepted and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together in an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his macedonian and persian subjects alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to persian and other noblewomen at susa but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year meanwhile upon his return to persia alexander learned that guards of the tomb of cyrus the great in pasargadae had desecrated it and swiftly executed them alexander admired cyrus the great from an early age reading xenophons cyropaedia which described cyruss heroism in battle and governance as a king and legislator during his visit to pasargadae alexander ordered his architect aristobulus to decorate the interior of the sepulchral chamber of cyrus tomb.nafterwards alexander travelled to ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the persian treasure there his closest friend and possible lover hephaestion died of illness or poisoning hephaestions death devastated alexander and he ordered the preparation of an expensive funeral pyre in babylon as well as a decree for public mourning back in babylon alexander planned a series of new campaigns beginning with an

roughly 14 days before his death alexander entertained admiral nearchus and spent the night and next day drinking with medius of larissa he developed a fever which worsened until he was unable to speak the common soldiers anxious about his health were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them in the second account diodorus recounts that alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of heracles followed by 11 days of weakness he did not develop a fever and died after some agony arrian also mentioned this as an alternative but plutarch specifically denied this claim.ngiven the propensity of the macedonian aristocracy to assassination foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death diodorus plutarch arrian and justin all mentioned the theory that alexander was poisoned justin stated that alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication while both diodorus and arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness the accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating antipater recently removed as macedonian viceroy and at odds with olympias as the head of the alleged plot perhaps taking his summons to babylon as a death sentence and having seen the fate of parmenion and philotas antipater purportedly arranged for alexander to be poisoned by his son iollas who was alexanders wine-pourer there was even a suggestion that aristotle may have participated.nthe strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death such long-acting poisons were probably not available however in a 2003 bbc documentary investigating the death of alexander leo schep from the new zealand national poisons centre proposed that the plant white hellebore veratrum album which was known in antiquity may have been used to poison alexander in a 2014 manuscript in the journal clinical toxicology schep suggested alexanders wine was spiked with veratrum album and that this would produce poisoning symptoms that match the course of events described in the alexander romance veratrum album poisoning can have a prolonged course and it was suggested that if alexander was poisoned veratrum album offers the most plausible cause another poisoning explanation put forward in 2010 proposed that the circumstances of his death were compatible with poisoning by water of the river styx modern-day mavroneri in arcadia greece that contained calicheamicin a dangerous compound produced by bacteria.nseveral natural causes diseases have been suggested including malaria and typhoid fever a 1998 article in the new england journal of medicine attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis another recent analysis suggested pyogenic infectious spondylitis or meningitis other illnesses fit the symptoms including acute pancreatitis and west nile virus natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that alexanders health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds the anguish that alexander felt after hephaestions death may also have contributed to his declining health.nnafter deathnsee also tomb of alexander the greatn detail of alexander on the alexander sarcophagusnalexanders body was laid in a gold anthropoid sarcophagus that was filled with honey which was in turn placed in a gold casket according to aelian a seer called aristander foretold that the land where alexander was laid to rest would be happy and unvanquishable forever perhaps more likely the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy since burying the prior king was a royal prerogative.nwhile alexanders funeral cortege was on its way to macedon ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to memphis his successor ptolemy ii philadelphus transferred the sarcophagus to alexandria where it remained until at least late antiquity ptolemy ix lathyros one of ptolemys final successors replaced alexanders sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage the recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern greece at amphipolis dating from the time of alexander the great has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of alexander this would fit with the intended destination of alexanders funeral cortege.npompey julius caesar and augustus all visited the tomb in alexandria where augustus allegedly accidentally knocked the nose off caligula was said to have taken alexanders breastplate from the tomb for his own use around ad 200 emperor septimius severus closed alexanders tomb to the public his son and successor caracalla a great admirer visited the tomb during his own reign after this details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.nthe so-called alexander sarcophagus discovered near sidon and now in the istanbul archaeology museum is so named not because it was thought to have contained alexanders remains but because its bas-reliefs depict alexander and his companions fighting the persians and hunting it was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of abdalonymus died 311 bc the king of sidon appointed by alexander immediately following the battle of issus in 331 however more recently it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than abdalonymus death.nndivision of the empirenmain articles partition of babylon and diadochin kingdoms of the diadochi in 301 bc the

by roxane being born after alexanders death according to diodorus alexanders companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom his laconic reply was ti kratisti""to the strongest another theory is that his successors willfully or erroneously misheard ti krateri""to craterus the general leading his macedonian troops home and newly entrusted with the regency of macedonia.narrian and plutarch claimed that alexander was speechless by this point implying that this was an apocryphal story diodorus curtius and justin offered the more plausible story that alexander passed his signet ring to perdiccas a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry in front of witnesses thereby nominating him.nperdiccas initially did not claim power instead suggesting that roxanes baby would be king if male with himself craterus leonnatus and antipater as guardians however the infantry under the command of meleager rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion instead they supported alexanders half-brother philip arrhidaeus eventually the two sides reconciled and after the birth of alexander iv he and philip iii were appointed joint kings albeit in name only.ndissension and rivalry soon afflicted the macedonians however the satrapies handed out by perdiccas at the partition of babylon became power bases each general used to bid for power after the assassination of perdiccas in 321 bc macedonian unity collapsed and 40 years of war between the successors diadochi ensued before the hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocs ptolemaic egypt seleucid mesopotamia and central asia attalid anatolia and antigonid macedon in the process both alexander iv and philip iii were murdered.nnwilln commemorative coin by agathocles of

for military expansion into the southern and western mediterranean monumental constructions and the intermixing of eastern and western populations it included:nnncharacterngeneralshipn the battle of the granicus 334 bcn the battle of issus 333 bcnalexander earned the epithet the great due to his unparalleled success as a military commander he never lost a battle despite typically being outnumbered this was due to use of terrain phalanx and cavalry tactics bold strategy and the fierce loyalty of his troops the macedonian phalanx armed with the sarissa a spear 6 metres 20 ft long had been developed and perfected by philip ii through rigorous training and alexander used its speed and maneuverability to great effect against larger but more disparate persian forces alexander also recognized the potential for disunity among his diverse army which employed various languages and weapons he overcame this by being personally involved in battle in the manner of a macedonian king.nin his first battle in asia at granicus alexander used only a small part of his forces perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry against a much larger persian force of 40,000 alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings so that his line matched the length of the persian cavalry line about 3 km 1.86 mi by contrast the persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry this ensured that alexander would not be outflanked while his phalanx armed with long pikes had a considerable advantage over the persians scimitars and javelins macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the persians.nat issus in 333 bc his first confrontation with darius he used the same deployment and again the central phalanx pushed through alexander personally led the charge in the center routing the opposing army at the decisive encounter with darius at gaugamela darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes alexander arranged a double phalanx with the center advancing at an angle parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming the advance was successful and broke darius center causing the latter to flee once again.nwhen faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques such as in central asia and india alexander adapted his forces to his opponents style thus in bactria and sogdiana alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements while massing his cavalry at the center in india confronted by porus elephant corps the macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants handlers.nnphysical appearancen roman copy of a herma by lysippos louvre museum plutarch reports that sculptures by lysippos were the most faithful.ngreek biographer plutarch c 45 c 120 ad describes alexanders appearance as:nnthe outward appearance of alexander is best represented by the statues of him which lysippus made and it was by this artist alone that alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled for those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate namely the poise of the neck which was bent slightly to the left and the melting glance of his eyes this artist has accurately observed apelles however in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt did not reproduce his complexion but made it too dark and swarthy whereas he was of a fair colour as they say and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly and in his face moreover that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh so that his garments were filled with it this we have read in the memoirs of aristoxenus.nngreek historian arrian lucius flavius arrianus xenophon c 86 c 160 ad described alexander as:nn the strong handsome commander with one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky.nnthe semi-legendary alexander romance also suggests that alexander exhibited heterochromia iridum that one eye was dark and the other light.nbritish historian peter green provided a description of alexanders appearance based on his review of statues and some ancient documents:nn physically alexander was not prepossessing even by macedonian standards he was very short though stocky and tough his beard was scanty and he stood out against his hirsute macedonian barons by going clean-shaven his neck was in some way twisted so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle his eyes one blue one brown revealed a dewy feminine quality he had a high complexion and a harsh voice.nnancient authors recorded that alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image lysippos had often used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray alexander and other characters such as apoxyomenos hermes and eros lysippos sculpture famous for its naturalism as opposed to a stiffer more static pose is thought to be the most faithful depiction.nnpersonalityn alexander left wearing a kausia and fighting an asiatic lion with his friend craterus detail late 4th century bc mosaic pella museumnsome of alexanders strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents his mother had huge ambitions and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the persian empire olympias influence instilled a sense of destiny in him and plutarch tells how his ambition kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years however his father philip was alexanders most immediate and influential role model as the young alexander watched him campaign practically every year winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds alexanders relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality he had a need to outdo his father illustrated by his reckless behaviour in battle while alexander worried that his father would leave him no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world he also downplayed his fathers achievements to his companions.naccording to plutarch among alexanders traits were a violent temper and rash impulsive nature which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions although alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father he was open to reasoned debate he had a calmer sideperceptive logical and calculating he had a great desire for knowledge a love for philosophy and was an avid reader this was no doubt in part due to aristotles tutelage alexander was intelligent and quick to learn his intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general he had great self-restraint in pleasures of the body in contrast with his lack of self-control with alcohol.nn a roman copy of an original 3rd century bc greek bust depicting alexander the great ny carlsberg glyptotek copenhagennalexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences however he had little interest in sports or the olympic games unlike his father seeking only the homeric ideals of honour tim and glory kudos he had great charisma and force of personality characteristics which made him a great leader his unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite macedonia and retain the empire after his deathonly alexander had the ability to do so.nduring his final years and especially after the death of hephaestion alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia his extraordinary achievements coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions may have combined to produce this effect his delusions of grandeur are readily visible in his will and in his desire to conquer the world in as much as he is by various sources described as having boundless ambition an epithet the meaning of which has descended into an historical clich.nhe appears to have believed himself a deity or at least sought to deify himself olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of zeus a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of amun at siwa he began to identify himself as the son of zeus-ammon alexander adopted elements of persian dress and customs at court notably proskynesis a practice of which macedonians disapproved and were loath to perform this behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen however alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine thus rather than megalomania his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.nnpersonal relationshipsnmain article personal relationships of alexander the greatn a mural in pompeii depicting the marriage of alexander to barsine stateira in 324 bc the couple are apparently dressed as ares and aphrodite.nalexander married three times roxana daughter of the sogdian nobleman oxyartes of bactria out of love and the persian princesses stateira ii and parysatis ii the former a daughter of darius iii and latter a daughter of artaxerxes iii for political reasons he apparently had two sons alexander iv of macedon by roxana and possibly heracles of macedon from his mistress barsine he lost another child when roxana miscarried at babylon.nalexander also had a close relationship with his friend general and bodyguard hephaestion the son of a macedonian noble hephaestions death devastated alexander this event may have contributed to alexanders failing health and detached mental state during his final months.nalexanders sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy in modern times the roman era writer athenaeus says based on the scholar dicaearchus who was alexanders contemporary that the king was also very much in the habit of giving in to this fashion i.e homosexuality and that alexander sexually embraced his eunuch bagoas in public this episode is also told by plutarch probably based on the same source no ancient writer however explicitly describes alexanders relationship with hephaestion as sexual though the pair was often compared to achilles and patroclus whom classical greek culture painted as a couple aelian writes of alexanders visit to troy where alexander garlanded the tomb of achilles and hephaestion that of patroclus the latter hinting that he was a beloved of alexander in just the same way as patroclus was of achilles some modern historians e.g robin lane fox believe not only that alexanders youthful relationship with hephaestion was sexual but that their sexual contacts may have continued into adulthood which went against the social norms of at least some greek cities such as athens though some modern researchers have provisionally proposed that macedonia or at least the macedonian court may have been more tolerant of homosexuality between adults.ngreen argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that alexander had much carnal interest in women he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life however he was relatively young when he died and ogden suggests that alexanders matrimonial record is more impressive than his fathers at the same age apart from wives alexander had many more female companions alexander accumulated a harem in the style of persian kings but he used it rather sparingly showing great self-control in pleasures of the body nevertheless plutarch described how alexander was infatuated by roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her green suggested that in the context of the period alexander formed quite strong friendships with women including ada of caria who adopted him and even darius mother sisygambis who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of alexanders death.nnbattle recordnnlegacyn the hellenistic world view after alexander ancient world map of eratosthenes 276194 bc incorporating information

were at least initially dominant forces and these 300 years are often referred to as the hellenistic period.nthe eastern borders of alexanders empire began to collapse even during his lifetime however the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful indian dynasties in history the maurya empire taking advantage of this power vacuum

state of its time covering approximately 5.2 million square km.nhellenization was coined by the german historian johann gustav droysen to denote the spread of greek language culture and population into the former persian empire after alexanders conquest that this export took place is undoubted and can be seen in the great hellenistic cities of for instance alexandria antioch and seleucia south of modern baghdad alexander sought to insert greek elements into persian culture and attempted to hybridize greek and persian culture this culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of asia and europe however his successors explicitly rejected such policies nevertheless hellenization occurred throughout the region accompanied by a distinct and opposite orientalization of the successor states.nthe core of the hellenistic culture promulgated by the conquests was essentially athenian the close association of men from across greece in alexanders army directly led to the emergence of the largely attic-based koine or common greek dialect koine spread throughout the hellenistic world becoming the lingua franca of hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of modern greek furthermore town planning education local government and art current in the hellenistic period were all based on classical greek ideals evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as

indian and especially buddhist culture the resulting syncretism known as greco-buddhism heavily influenced the development of buddhism and created a culture of greco-buddhist art these greco-buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first buddhist missionaries to china sri lanka and the mediterranean greco-buddhist monasticism some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the buddha appeared at this time perhaps modeled on greek statues of apollo in the greco-buddhist style several buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient greek religion the concept of boddhisatvas is reminiscent of greek divine heroes and some mahayana ceremonial practices burning incense gifts of flowers and food placed on altars are similar to those practiced by the ancient greeks however similar practices were also observed amongst the native indic culture one greek king menander i probably became buddhist and was immortalized in buddhist literature as milinda the process of hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west for example greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century bc were found in the greco-bactrian city of ai khanoum in modern-day afghanistan while the greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain mount meru like the petals of a flower the yavanajataka lit greek astronomical treatise and paulisa siddhanta texts depict the influence of greek astronomical ideas on indian astronomy.nfollowing the conquests of alexander the great in the east hellenistic influence on indian art was far-ranging in the area of architecture a few examples of the
