viking 1 wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnviking 1 was the first of two spacecraft along with viking 2 sent to mars as part of nasas viking program on july 20 1976 it became the second spacecraft to soft-land on mars and the first soft lander to successfully perform its mission the first spacecraft to soft-land on mars was the soviet unions mars 3 on december 2 1971 which stopped transmitting after 14.5 seconds viking 1 held the record for the longest mars surface mission of 2307 days over 6 years or 2245 martian solar days until that record was broken by opportunity on may 19 2010.nncontentsnnnmissioneditnfollowing launch using a titan/centaur launch vehicle on august 20 1975 and a 10-month cruise to mars the orbiter began returning global images of mars about 5 days before orbit insertion the viking 1 orbiter was inserted into mars orbit on june 19 1976 and trimmed to a 1513 x 33,000 km 24.66 h site certification orbit on june 21 landing on mars was planned for july 4 1976 the united states bicentennial but imaging of the primary landing site showed it was too rough for a safe landing the landing was delayed until a safer site was found and took place instead on july 20 the seventh anniversary of the apollo 11 moon landing the lander separated from the orbiter at 08:51 utc and landed at 11:53:06 utc it was the first attempt by the united states at landing on mars.nnorbitereditnthe instruments of the orbiter consisted of two vidicon cameras for imaging vis an infrared spectrometer for water vapor mapping mawd and infrared radiometers for thermal mapping irtm the orbiter primary mission ended at the beginning of solar conjunction on november 5 1976 the extended mission commenced on december 14 1976 after solar conjunction operations included close approaches to phobos in february 1977 the periapsis was reduced to 300 km on march 11 1977 minor orbit adjustments were done occasionally over the course of the mission primarily to change the walk rate the rate at which the areocentric longitude changed with each orbit and the periapsis was raised to 357 km on july 20 1979 on august 7 1980 viking 1 orbiter was running low on attitude control gas and its orbit was raised from 357 33943 km to 320 56000 km to prevent impact with mars and possible contamination until the year 2019 operations were terminated on august 17 1980 after 1485 orbits a 2009 analysis concluded that while the possibility that viking 1 had impacted mars could not be ruled out it was most likely still in orbit.nnlandereditn viking aeroshell model of viking landerthe lander and its aeroshell separated from the orbiter on july 20 at 08:51 utc at the time of separation the lander was orbiting at about 5 kilometers per second 3.1 miles per second the aeroshells retrorockets fired to begin the lander de-orbit maneuver after a few hours at about 300 kilometers 190 miles altitude the lander was reoriented for atmospheric entry the aeroshell with its ablative heat shield slowed the craft as it plunged through the atmosphere during this time entry science experiments were performed by using a retarding potential analyzer a mass spectrometer as well as pressure temperature and density sensors at 6 km 3.7 mi altitude traveling at about 250 meters per second 820 feet per second the 16 m diameter lander parachutes deployed seven seconds later the aeroshell was jettisoned and 8 seconds after that the three lander legs were extended in 45 seconds the parachute had slowed the lander to 60 meters per second 200 feet per second at 1.5 km 0.93 mi altitude retrorockets on the lander itself were ignited and 40 seconds later at about 2.4 m/s 7.9 ft/s the lander arrived on mars with a relatively light jolt the legs had honeycomb aluminum shock absorbers to soften the landing.nthe landing rockets used an 18-nozzle design to spread the hydrogen and nitrogen exhaust over a large area nasa calculated that this approach would mean that the surface would not be heated by more than one 1 c 1.8 f and that it would move no more than 1 millimeter 0.04 inches of surface material since most of vikings experiments focused on the surface material a more straightforward design would not have served.nthe viking 1 lander touched down in western chryse planitia golden plain at 224149n 481319w 22.697n 48.222w 22.697 48.222 at a reference

16:13 local mars time approximately 22 kilograms 49 lb of propellants were left at landing.ntransmission of the first surface image began 25 seconds after landing and took about four minutes see below during these minutes the lander activated itself it erected a high-gain antenna pointed toward earth for direct communication and deployed a meteorology boom mounted with sensors in the next seven minutes the second picture of the 300 panoramic scene displayed below was taken.non the day after the landing the first color picture of the surface of mars displayed below was taken the seismometer failed to uncage and a sampler arm locking pin was stuck and took five days to shake out otherwise all experiments functioned normally the lander had two means of returning data to earth a relay link up to the orbiter and back and by using a direct link to earth the data capacity of the relay link was about 10 times higher than the direct link.nnn first clear image ever transmitted from the surface of mars shows rocks near the viking 1 lander july 20 1976 the haze on the left is possibly dust that had recently been kicked up by the landing rockets because of the slow scan facsimile nature of the cameras the dust since settled by mid-image.nnthe lander had two facsimile cameras three analyses for metabolism growth or photosyntheses a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer gcms an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer pressure temperature and wind velocity sensors a three-axis seismometer a magnet on a sampler observed by the cameras and various engineering sensors.nthe viking 1 lander was named the thomas mutch memorial station in january 1982 in honor of thomas a mutch the leader of the viking imaging team the lander operated for 2245 sols about 2306 earth days or 6 years until november 11 1982 sol 2600 when a faulty command sent by ground control resulted in loss of contact the command was intended to uplink new battery charging software to improve the landers deteriorating battery capacity but it inadvertently overwrote data used by the antenna pointing software attempts to contact the lander during the next four months based on the presumed antenna position were unsuccessful in 2006 the viking 1 lander was imaged on the martian surface by the mars reconnaissance orbiter.nnmission resultseditnsearch for lifeeditnviking 1 carried a biology experiment whose purpose was to look for evidence of life the viking spacecraft biological experiments weighed 15.5 kg 34 lbs and consisted of three subsystems the pyrolytic release experiment pr the labeled release experiment lr and the gas exchange experiment gex in addition independent of the biology experiments viking carried a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer gcms that could measure the composition and abundance of organic compounds in the martian soil the results were surprising and interesting the gcms gave a negative result the pr gave a negative result the gex gave a negative result and the lr gave a positive result viking scientist patricia straat stated in 2009 our lr experiment was a definite positive response for life but a lot of people have claimed that it was a false positive for a variety of reasons most scientists now believe that the data were due to inorganic chemical reactions of the soil however this view may be changing after the recent discovery of near-surface ice near the viking landing zone some scientists still believe the results were due to living reactions no organic chemicals were found in the soil however dry areas of antarctica do not have detectable organic compounds either but they have organisms living in the rocks mars has almost no ozone layer unlike the earth so uv light sterilizes the surface and produces highly reactive chemicals such as peroxides that would oxidize any organic chemicals the phoenix lander discovered the chemical perchlorate in the martian soil perchlorate is a strong oxidant so it may have destroyed any organic matter on the surface if it is widespread on mars carbon-based life would be difficult at the soil surface.nnfirst panorama by viking 1 landereditnn first panoramic view by viking 1 from

the cassini space probe artists impressionngravitational time dilation is a phenomenon predicted by the theory of general relativity whereby time passes more slowly in regions of lower gravitational potential scientists used the lander to test this hypothesis by sending radio signals to the lander on mars and instructing the lander to send back signals in cases which sometimes included the signal passing close to the sun scientists found that the observed shapiro delays of the signals matched the predictions of general relativity.nnorbiter shotseditnnlander locationeditnnn interactive imagemap
