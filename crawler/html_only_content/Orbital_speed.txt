orbital speed wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnot to be confused with escape velocity.nnin gravitationally bound systems the orbital speed of an astronomical body or object e.g planet moon artificial satellite spacecraft or star is the speed at which it orbits around either the barycenter or if the object is much less massive than the largest body in the system its speed relative to that largest body the speed in this latter case may be relative to the surface of the larger body or relative to its center of mass.nthe term can be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed i.e the average speed over an entire orbit or its instantaneous speed at a particular point in its orbit maximum instantaneous orbital speed occurs at periapsis perigee perhelion etc while minimum speed for objects in closed orbits occurs at apoapsis aphelion apogee etc in ideal two-body systems objects in open orbits continue to slow down forever as their distance to the barycenter increases nwhen a system approximates a two-body system instantaneous orbital speed at a given point of the orbit can be computed from its distance to the central body and the objects specific orbital energy specific orbital energy is constant and independent of position.nncontentsnnnradial trajectorieseditnin the following it is assumed that the system is a two-body system and the orbiting object has a negligible mass compared to the larger central object in real-world orbital mechanics it is the systems barycenter not the larger object which is at the focus.nspecific orbital energy k.e p.e kinetic energy potential energy since kinetic energy is always non-negative greater than or equal to zero 0 and potential energy is always non-positive less than or equal to zero 0 the sign of this may be positive zero or negative and the sign tells us something about the type of orbit:nnntransverse orbital speededitnthe transverse orbital speed is inversely proportional to the distance to the central body because of the law of conservation of angular momentum or equivalently keplers second law this states that as a body moves around its orbit during a fixed amount of time the line from the barycenter to the body sweeps a constant area of the orbital plane regardless of which part of its orbit the body traces during that period of time.nthis law implies that the body moves slower near its apoapsis than near its periapsis because at the smaller distance along the arc it needs to move faster to cover the same area.nnmean orbital speededitnfor orbits with small eccentricity the length of the orbit nis close to that of a circular one and the mean orbital speed can be approximated either from observations of the orbital period and the semimajor axis of its orbit or from knowledge of the masses of the two bodies and the semimajor axis.nnnwhere v is the orbital velocity a is the length of the semimajor axis t is the orbital period and gm is the standard gravitational parameter this is an approximation that only holds true when the orbiting body is of considerably lesser mass than the central one and eccentricity is close to zero.nwhen one of the bodies is not of considerably lesser mass see gravitational two-body problemnso when one of the masses is almost negligible compared to the other mass as the case for earth and sun one can approximate the orbit velocity as:nnnor assuming r equal to the bodys radiusnnnwhere m is the greater mass around which this negligible mass or body is orbiting and v is the escape velocity.nfor an object in an eccentric orbit orbiting a much larger body the length of the orbit decreases with orbital eccentricity e and is an ellipse this can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the average orbital speed:nnnthe mean orbital speed decreases with eccentricity.nnprecise orbital speededitnfor the precise orbital speed of a body at any given point in its trajectory both the mean distance and the precise distance are taken into account:nnnwhere is the standard gravitational parameter r is the distance at which the speed is to be calculated and a is the length of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit this expression is called the vis-viva equation for the earth at perihelion,nnnwhich is slightly faster than earths average orbital speed of 29,800 m/s as expected from keplers 2nd law.nntangential velocities at altitudeeditnnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
