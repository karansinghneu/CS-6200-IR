list of multiple discoveries wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnmain article multiple discoverynhistorians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence in science of multiple independent discovery robert k merton defined such multiples as instances in which similar discoveries are made by scientists working independently of each other sometimes writes merton the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which unknown to him somebody else has made years before."ncommonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of calculus by isaac newton gottfried wilhelm leibniz and others described by a rupert hall the 18th-century discovery of oxygen by carl wilhelm scheele joseph priestley antoine lavoisier and others and the theory of the evolution of species independently advanced in the 19th century by charles darwin and alfred russel wallace.nmultiple independent discovery however is not limited to only a few historic instances involving giants of scientific research merton believed that it is multiple discoveries rather than unique ones that represent the common pattern in science.nmerton contrasted a multiple with a singleton"a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.na distinction is drawn between a discovery and an invention as discussed for example by bolesaw prus however since the same phenomenon of multiplicity occurs in relation to both discoveries and inventions this article lists both multiple discoveries and multiple inventions.nncontentsnnn3rd century bceeditn aristarchosnn13th century ceeditn copernicusnn14th centuryeditnn16th centuryeditn galileon orteliusnn17th centuryeditn newtonn leibniznn18th centuryeditn scheelen laplacenn19th centuryeditn gaussn faradayn darwinn pierre janssenn mendeleyevn belln abakanowiczn cybulskin gibbsnn20th centuryeditn becquereln nettie stevensn skodowska curien smoluchowskin tykociski-tykocinern einsteinn alexander friedmannn hsien wun szilrdn purcelln nambun higgsn penziasn baltimoren tingn immermannn21st centuryeditn wilczeknn perlmutter riess schmidtn mcdonald kajitannquotationseditn"when the time is ripe for certain things these things appear in different places in the manner of violets coming to light in early spring farkas bolyai to his son jnos bolyai urging him to claim the invention of non-euclidean geometry without delay quoted in ming li and paul vitanyi an introduction to kolmogorov complexity and its applications 1st ed 1993 p 83.nn"you do not make a discovery until a background knowledge is built up to a place where its almost impossible not to see the new thing and it often happens that the new step is done contemporaneously in two different places in the world independently a physicist nobel laureate interviewed by harriet zuckerman in scientific elite nobel laureates in the united states 1977 p 204.nn"a man can no more be completely original than a tree can grow out of air george bernard shaw preface to major barbara 1905.nnsee alsoeditnnnnnoteseditnnnreferenceseditnnexternal linkseditnnthis list is incomplete you can help by expanding it.nnnn ncategories hidden categories n
