mark shuttleworthnspace tourism is space travel for recreational leisure or business purposes there are several different types of space tourism including orbital suborbital and lunar space tourism to date orbital space tourism has been performed only by the russian space agency work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles this is being done by aerospace companies like blue origin and virgin galactic in addition spacex an aerospace manufacturer announced in 2018 that it is planning on sending two space tourists on a free-return trajectory around the moon on the upper stage of spacexs bfr rocket known as the big falcon spaceship bfs.nduring the period from 2001 to 2009 the publicized price for flights brokered by space adventures to the international space station aboard a russian soyuz spacecraft was in the range of us$2040 million 7 space tourists made 8 space flights during this time some space tourists have signed contracts with third parties to conduct certain research activities while in orbit by 2007 space tourism was thought to be one of the earliest markets that would emerge for commercial spaceflight space adventures is the only company that has sent paying passengers to space in conjunction with the federal space agency of the russian federation and rocket and space corporation energia space adventures facilitated the flights for all of the worlds first private space explorers the first three participants paid in excess of 20 million usd each for their 10-day visit to the iss.nrussia halted orbital space tourism in 2010 due to the increase in the international space station crew size using the seats for expedition crews that would previously have been sold to paying spaceflight participants orbital tourist flights were set to resume in 2015 but the one planned was postponed indefinitely and none have occurred since 2009.nas an alternative term to tourism some organizations such as the commercial spaceflight federation use the term personal spaceflight the citizens in space project uses the term citizen space exploration".nncontentsnnnterminologyeditnmany private space travelers have objected to the term space tourist often pointing out that their role went beyond that of an observer since they also carried out scientific experiments in the course of their journey richard garriott additionally emphasized that his training was identical to the requirements of non-russian soyuz crew members and that teachers and other non-professional astronauts chosen to fly with nasa are called astronauts he has said that if the distinction has to be made he would rather be called private astronaut than tourist dennis tito has asked to be known as an independent researcher and mark shuttleworth described himself as a pioneer of commercial space travel gregory olsen prefers private researcher and anousheh ansari prefers the term private space explorer other space enthusiasts object to the term on similar grounds rick tumlinson of the space frontier foundation for example has said i hate the word tourist and i always will tourist is somebody in a flowered shirt with three cameras around his neck russian cosmonaut maksim surayev told the press in 2009 not to describe guy lalibert as a tourist its become fashionable to speak of space tourists he is not a tourist but a participant in the mission."n"spaceflight participant is the official term used by nasa and the russian federal space agency to distinguish between private space travelers and career astronauts tito shuttleworth olsen ansari and simonyi were designated as such during their respective space flights nasa also lists christa mcauliffe as a spaceflight participant although she did not pay a fee apparently due to her non-technical duties aboard the sts-51-l flight.nthe us federal aviation administration awards the title of commercial astronaut to trained crew members of privately funded spacecraft the only people currently holding this title are mike melvill and brian binnie the pilots of spaceshipone.nnprecursorseditnsee also space racenthe soviet space program was aggressive in broadening the pool of cosmonauts the soviet intercosmos program included cosmonauts selected from warsaw pact member countries czechoslovakia poland east germany bulgaria hungary romania and later from allies of the ussr cuba mongolia vietnam and non-aligned countries india syria afghanistan most of these cosmonauts received full training for their missions and were treated as equals but were generally given shorter flights than soviet cosmonauts the european space agency esa also took advantage of the program.nthe us space shuttle program included payload specialist positions which were usually filled by representatives of companies or institutions managing a specific payload on that mission these payload specialists did not receive the same training as professional nasa astronauts and were not employed by nasa in 1983 ulf merbold from esa and byron lichtenberg from mit engineer and air force fighter pilot were the first payload specialists to fly on the space shuttle on mission sts-9.nin 1984 charles d walker became the first non-government astronaut to fly with his employer mcdonnell douglas paying us$40,000 equivalent to 96,464 in 2018 for his flight nasa was also eager to prove its capability to congressional sponsors during the 1970s shuttle prime contractor rockwell international studied a 200300 million removable cabin that could fit into the shuttles cargo bay the cabin could carry up to 74 passengers into orbit for up to three days space habitation design associates proposed in 1983 a cabin for 72 passengers in the bay passengers were located in six sections each with windows and its own loading ramp and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing another proposal was based on the spacelab habitation modules which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area a 1985 presentation to the national space society stated that although flying tourists in the cabin would cost 1 to 1.5 million per passenger without government subsidy within 15 years 30,000 people a year would pay us$25,000 equivalent to 58,238 in 2018 each to fly in space on new spacecraft the presentation also forecast flights to lunar orbit within 30 years and visits to the lunar surface within 50 years.nas the shuttle program expanded in the early 1980s nasa began a space flight participant program to allow citizens without scientific or governmental roles to fly christa mcauliffe was chosen as the first teacher in space in july 1985 from 11,400 applicants 1,700 applied for the journalist in space program an artist in space program was considered and nasa expected that after mcauliffes flight two to three civilians a year would fly on the shuttle after mcauliffe was killed in the challenger disaster in january 1986 the programs were canceled mcauliffes backup barbara morgan eventually got hired in 1998 as a professional astronaut and flew on sts-118 as a mission specialist a second journalist-in-space program in which nasa green-lighted miles obrien to fly on the space shuttle was scheduled to be announced in 2003 that program was canceled in the wake of the columbia disaster on sts-107 and subsequent emphasis on finishing the international space station before retiring the space shuttle.nninitially senior figures at nasa strongly opposed space tourism on principle from the beginning of the iss expeditions nasa stated it wasnt interested in accommodating paying guests the subcommittee on space and aeronautics committee on science of the house of representatives held in june 2001 revealed the shifting attitude of nasa towards paying space tourists wanting to travel to the iss in its statement on the hearings purpose review the issues and opportunities for flying nonprofessional astronauts in space the appropriate government role for supporting the nascent space tourism industry use of the shuttle and space station for tourism safety and training criteria for space tourists and the potential commercial market for space tourism the subcommittee report was interested in evaluating dennis titos extensive training and his experience in space as a nonprofessional astronaut.nwith the realities of the post-perestroika economy in russia its space industry was especially starved for cash the tokyo broadcasting system tbs offered to pay for one of its reporters to fly on a mission toyohiro akiyama was flown in 1990 to mir with the eighth crew and returned a week later with the seventh crew cost estimates vary from 10 million up to 37 million akiyama gave a daily tv broadcast from orbit and also performed scientific experiments for russian and japanese companies however since the cost of the flight was paid by his employer akiyama could be considered a business traveler rather than a tourist.nin 1991 british chemist helen sharman was selected from a pool of 13,000 applicants to be the first briton in space the program was known as project juno and was a cooperative arrangement between the soviet union and a group of british companies the project juno consortium failed to raise the funds required and the program was almost canceled reportedly mikhail gorbachev ordered it to proceed under soviet expense in the interests of international relations but in the absence of western underwriting less expensive experiments were substituted for those in the original plans sharman flew aboard soyuz tm-12 to mir and returned aboard soyuz tm-11.nnsub-orbital space tourismeditnsee also sub-orbital spaceflightnas of 2018 no suborbital space tourism has yet occurred but since it is projected to be more affordable many companies view it as a money-making proposition most are proposing vehicles that make suborbital flights peaking at an altitude of 100160 km 6299 mi passengers would experience three to six minutes of weightlessness a view of a twinkle-free starfield and a vista of the curved earth below projected costs are expected to be about 200,000 per passenger.nnsuccessful projectseditnnongoing projectseditnncancelled projectseditnnorbital space tourismeditnsee also orbital spaceflightnsuccessful projectseditnat the end of the 1990s mircorp a private venture that was by then in charge of the space station began seeking potential space tourists to visit mir in order to offset some of its maintenance costs dennis tito an american businessman and former jpl scientist became their first candidate when the decision was made to de-orbit mir tito managed to switch his trip to the international space station iss through a deal between mircorp and us-based space adventures ltd dennis tito visited the iss for seven days in april-may 2001 becoming the worlds first fee-paying space tourist.ntito was followed in april 2002 by south african mark shuttleworth soyuz tm-34 the third was gregory olsen in october 2005 soyuz tma-7 in february 2003 the space shuttle columbia disintegrated on re-entry into the earths atmosphere killing all seven astronauts aboard after this disaster space tourism on the russian soyuz program was temporarily put on hold because soyuz vehicles became the only available transport to the iss after the shuttle return to service in july 2005 space tourism was resumed in september 2006 an iranian american businesswoman named anousheh ansari became the fourth space tourist soyuz tma-9 in april 2007 charles simonyi an american businessman of hungarian descent joined their ranks soyuz tma-10 simonyi became the first repeat space tourist paying again to fly on soyuz tma-14 in march 2009 british-american richard garriott became the next space tourist in october 2008 aboard soyuz tma-14 as of 2018 canadian guy lalibert is the most recent tourism to fly to the iss in september 2009 aboard soyuz tma-16 since the space shuttle was retired in 2011 soyuz once again became the only means of accessing the iss and so tourism was once again put on hold.nbigelow aerospace acquired the designs for inflatable space habitats from nasas transhab program and has already launched two first inflatable habitat modules the first named genesis i was launched in july 2006 and the second test module genesis ii was

dictates that outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty by means of use or occupation or by any other means however countries have the right to freely explore the moon and any resources collected are property of that country when they return.nnunited stateseditnin december 2005 the us government released a set of proposed rules for space tourism these included screening procedures and training for emergency situations but not health requirements.nunder current us law any company proposing to launch paying passengers from american soil on a suborbital rocket must receive a license from the federal aviation administrations office of commercial space transportation faa/ast the licensing process focuses on public safety and safety of property and the details can be found in the code of federal regulations title 14 chapter iii this is in accordance with the commercial space launch amendments act passed by congress in 2004.nin march 2010 the new mexico legislature passed the spaceflight informed consent act the sica gives legal protection to companies who provide private space flights in the case of accidental harm or death to individuals participants sign an informed consent waiver dictating that spaceflight operators cannot be held liable in the death of a participant resulting from the inherent risks of space flight activities operators are however not covered in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct.nnattitudes toward space tourismeditna web-based survey suggested that over 70 of those surveyed wanted less than or equal to 2 weeks in space in addition 88 wanted to spacewalk only 14 of these would do it for a 50 premium and 21 wanted a hotel or space station.nthe concept has met with some criticism from some including politicians notably gnter verheugen vice-president of the european commission who said of the eads astrium space tourism project its only for the super-rich which is against my social convictions".nnenvironmental effectseditna 2010 study published in geophysical research letters raised concerns that the growing commercial spaceflight industry could accelerate global warming the study funded by nasa and the aerospace corporation simulated the impact of 1,000 suborbital launches of hybrid rockets from a single location calculating that this would release a total of 600 tonnes of black carbon into the stratosphere they found that the resultant layer of soot particles remained relatively localized with only 20 of the carbon straying into the southern hemisphere thus creating a strong hemispherical asymmetry this unbalance would cause the temperature to decrease by about 0.4 c 0.72 f in the tropics and subtropics whereas the temperature at the poles would increase by between 0.2 and 1 c 0.36 and 1.80 f the ozone layer would also be affected with the tropics losing up to 1.7 of ozone cover and the polar regions gaining 56 the researchers stressed that these results should not be taken as a precise forecast of the climate response to a specific launch rate of a specific rocket type but as a demonstration of the sensitivity of the atmosphere to the large-scale disruption that commercial space tourism could bring.nneducation and advocacyeditnseveral organizations have been formed to promote the space tourism industry including the space tourism society space future and hobbyspace unigalactic space travel magazine is a bi-monthly educational publication covering space tourism and space exploration developments in companies like spacex orbital sciences virgin galactic and organizations like nasa.nclasses in space tourism are currently taught at the rochester institute of technology in new york and keio university in japan.nneconomic potentialeditna 2010 report from the federal aviation administration titled the economic impact of commercial space transportation on the u s economy in 2009 cites studies done by futron an aerospace and technology-consulting firm which predict that space tourism could become a billion-dollar market within 20 years in addition in the nearly two decades since dennis tito journeyed to the international space station eight private citizens have paid the 20 million fee to travel to space space adventures suggests that this number could increase fifteen-fold by 2020 these figures do not include other private space agencies such as virgin galactic which as of 2014 has sold approximately 700 tickets priced at 200,000 or 250,000 dollars each and has accepted more than 80 million in deposits.nnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnfurther readingeditnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
