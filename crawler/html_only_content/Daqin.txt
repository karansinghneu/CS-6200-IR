arriving in china beginning in 166 ad and lasting into the 3rd century these early embassies were said to arrive by a maritime route via the south china sea in the chinese province of jiaozhi now northern vietnam archaeological evidence such as roman coins points to the presence of roman commercial activity in southeast asia later recorded embassies arriving from the byzantine empire lasting from the 7th to 11th centuries ostensibly took an overland route following the silk road alongside other europeans in medieval china byzantine greeks are recorded as being present in the court of kublai khan 12601294 the mongol ruler of the yuan dynasty in khanbaliq beijing while the hongwu emperor r 13681398 founder of the ming dynasty sent a letter of correspondence to byzantine emperor john

qin and chinas first emperor who unified chinas warring states by 221 bc the prefix da or great signified that the roman empire was on par with the might of the qin empire and was viewed as a utopian land located to the northwest of the parthian empire the title daqin does not seem to have any phonetic derivation from latin roma or greek romaik although it is possible that the latin term used for china serica i.e land of silk derived from greek serikon chinese si chinese pinyin s meaning silk originates from the name qin using early middle chinese pronunciation with the final syllable pronounced with an r sound.nnfulineditnthe term daqin was used from the han dynasty 202 bc 220 ad onwards but by the beginning of the tang dynasty 618907 ad a new name emerged in chinese historical records for distinguishing the eastern roman empire fulin chinese pinyin f ln friedrich hirth surmised that fulin may have been based on the accusative form of constantinopolis in greek polin in constantinopolin the eastern roman empires capital city constantinople using historical phonetic pronunciations of cantonese and japanese hirth also speculated that fulin in middle chinese was pronounced butlim or butlam and came from the syriac pronunciation for bethlehem while some scholars of the 20th century believed that fulin was a transliteration of ephrem an ancient word for israel samuel n c lieu highlights how more recent scholarship has deduced that fulin is most likely derived from the persianate word for the roman empire shared by several contemporaneous iranian languages

of the roman empire as a civilized counterpart to the chinese empire the romans occupied one extreme position on the trade route with the chinese located on the other.nchina never managed to reach the roman empire directly in antiquity although general ban chao sent gan ying as an envoy to daqin in 97 ad gan ying did not reach daqin he stopped at the coast of a large sea because sailors of the parthian west border told him that the voyage to cross the sea might take a long time and be dangerous gan ying left a detailed account of the roman empire but it is generally considered to have been based on second hand information from parthians:nn nthe kingdom of da qin the roman empire is also called lijian as it is found to the west of the sea it is also called the kingdom of haixi west of the sea the territory extends for several thousands of li it has more than four hundred walled towns there are several tens of smaller dependent kingdoms the walls of the towns are made of stone they have established postal relays at intervals which are all plastered and whitewashed there are pines and cypresses as well as trees and plants of all kinds.nnngan ying gives a very idealistic view of roman governance which is likely the result of some story he was told while visiting the persian gulf in 97 ad he also described less fancifully roman products:nnntheir kings are not permanent they select and appoint the most worthy man if there are unexpected calamities in the kingdom such as frequent extraordinary winds or rains he is unceremoniously rejected and replaced the one who has been dismissed quietly accepts his demotion and is not angry the people of this country are all tall and honest they resemble the people of the middle kingdom and that is why this kingdom is called da qin

made from the down of water sheep but which is made in fact from the cocoons of wild silkworms they blend all sorts of fragrances and by boiling the juice make a compound perfume they have all the precious and rare things that come from the various foreign kingdoms they make gold and silver coins ten silver coins are worth one gold coin they trade with anxi and tianzhu by sea the profit margin is ten to one the king of this country always wanted to send envoys to the han but anxi wishing to control the trade in multi-coloured chinese silks blocked the route to prevent the romans getting through to china.nnngeographical descriptions in the weileeditnfurther information geography of egyptn roman fresco from pompeii showing a maenad in silk dress naples national archaeological museumn

claims yet it mentions some as being the alexandria-euphrates or charax spasinu ala-san nikephorium lu-fen palmyra chieh-lan damascus hsien-tu emesa si-fu and hira ho-lat perhaps some of these are in reference to certain states that were temporarily conquered during the romanparthian wars 66 bc 217 ad when for instance the army of roman emperor trajan reached the persian gulf and captured characene the capital of which was charax spasinu the weile provides the traveling directions and approximate distances between each of these cities counted in ancient chinese miles li and along with the book of later han even mentions the pontoon bridge flying bridge across the euphrates at the roman city of zeugma commagene in modern-day turkey.nhirth and arkenberg identified si-fu chinese with emesa however john e hill provides evidence that it was most likely petra in the nabataean kingdom given the directions and distance from yuluo i.e al karak and the fact that it fell under roman dominion in 106 ad when it was annexed by trajan even more convincing for hill is the fact that si-fu in chinese means an arm of a river which rejoins the main stream or more aptly rejoined water courses he believes this is directly related to the reservoir and cistern flood-control system harnessing the many streams running through the settlement and nearby canyons or wadis such as the wadi musa valley of moses".nnchristianityeditnfurther information daqin pagodan the daqin pagoda which once formed part of a nestorian churchn the nestorian stele entitled stele to the propagation in china of the luminous religion of daqin was erected in china in 781.nin later eras starting in 550 ad as syriac christians settled along the silk road and founded mission churches daqin or tai-chin is also used to refer to these christian populations rather than to rome or the roman church so for example when the taoist tang emperor wuzong closed christian monasteries in the mid-9th century the imperial edict commanded:nn as for the tai-chin syrian christian and muh-hu zoroastrian forms of worship since buddhism has already been cast out these heresies alone must not be allowed to survive.nnthe name daqin for rome was used on chinese maps as late as the 16th century such as the sihai huayi zongtu the identification of daqin with the western roman empire eastern roman empire or the church of the east varies with the era and context of the document the nestorian stele erected in 781 in the tang capital changan contains an inscription that briefly summarizes the knowledge about daqin in the chinese histories written up to that point and notes how only the luminous religion i.e christianity was practiced there.nncapital citieseditnto the chinese the capital of daqin was an-tu or antioch the first great christian city however the old book of tang and new book of tang which identified daqin and fulin i.e the byzantine empire as the same countries noted a different capital city constantinople one that had walls of enormous height and was eventually besieged by the commander mo-yi chinese pinyin m zhui f zh of the da shi i.e the arabs friedrich hirth identifies this commander as muawiyah i who was first governor of syria before becoming caliph and founder of the umayyad caliphate the city of rome itself does not appear to have been described.nnembassieseditnfurther

with virgil horace and strabo roman histories offer only vague accounts of china and the silk-producing seres of the distant east the 2nd-century historian florus seems to have conflated the seres with peoples of india or at least noted that their skin complexions proved that they both lived beneath another sky than the romans the 1st-century geographer pomponius mela noted that their lands formed the center of the coast of an eastern ocean flanked by india to the south and the scythians of the northern steppe while the historian ammianus marcellinus c 330 c 400 wrote that the land of the seres was enclosed by great natural walls around a river called bautis perhaps the yellow river in his geography ptolemy also provided a rough sketch of the gulf of thailand and south china sea with a port city called cattigara lying beyond the golden chersonese i.e malay peninsula visited by a greek sailor named alexander among the proposed sites for ptolemys cattigara are oc eo vietnam where roman artefacts have been found.nin contrast chinese histories offer an abundance of source material about their interactions with alleged roman embassies and descriptions of their country the first of these embassies is recorded in the book of later han as having arrived by sea in 166 ad and came by way of jiaozhou later known as annam northern vietnam as would later embassies its members claimed to be representatives of the daqin ruler andun either antoninus pius or his co-emperor marcus aurelius antoninus and offered gifts to the court of emperor huan of han other embassies arrived sporadically afterwards the book of liang mentions a daqin embassy to sun quan of eastern wu in 226 while the book of jin records a daqin embassy to emperor wu of jin in 284.nalthough emperor yang of sui r 604618 had desired to send an embassy to daqin this never came to fruition instead an embassy from a country that was now called fulin i.e the byzantine empire which the old book of tang and new book of tang identified as being the same as daqin arrived in 643 at the court of emperor taizong of tang and claimed to represent their king bo duoli i.e knstantinos pogonatos constantine the bearded the nickname of constans ii several other fulin i.e byzantium embassies during the tang dynasty are mentioned for the years 667 701 and 719.nthe wenxian tongkao written by ma duanlin 12451322 and the

shenzong of song r 10671085 during the subsequent yuan dynasty 12711368 an unprecedented number of europeans started to visit and live in china such as marco polo and katarina vilioni and papal missionaries such as john of montecorvino and giovanni de marignolli the history of yuan recounts how a man of fulin named ai-sie transliteration of either joshua or joseph initially in the service of gyk khan was well-versed in western languages and had expertise in the fields of medicine and astronomy this convinced kublai khan founder of the yuan dynasty to offer him a position as the director of medical and astronomical boards eventually honoring him with the title of prince of fulin chinese f ln wng his biography in the history of yuan lists his children by their chinese names which are similar to the christian names elias ye-li-ah luke lu-ko and antony an-tun with a daughter named a-na-si-sz.nthe history of ming explains how the founder of the ming dynasty 13681644 the hongwu emperor sent a merchant of fulin named nieh-ku-lun back to his home country with a letter announcing the founding of a new dynasty it is speculated that this merchant was actually a former bishop of khanbaliq named nicolaus de bentra the history of ming goes on to explain that contacts between china and fulin ceased thereafter whereas an envoy of the great western sea i.e the mediterranean sea did not arrive again until the 16th century with the italian jesuit missionary matteo ricci.nncurrency and coinageeditnfurther information roman currency and byzantine currencyn bronze coin of constantius ii 337361 found in karghalik modern chinanalthough the ancient romans imported han chinese silk while the han-dynasty chinese imported roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs valerie hansen 2012 claimed that no roman coins from the roman republic 50727 bc or the principate 27 bc284 ad era of the roman empire have been found in china yet this assumption has been overturned warwick ball 2016 notes the discovery of sixteen roman coins found at xian china site of the han capital changan minted during the reign of various emperors from tiberius 1437 ad to aurelian 270275 ad the earliest gold solidus coins from the eastern roman empire found in china date to the reign of byzantine emperor theodosius ii r 408450 and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found compared to thirteen hundred silver coins in xinjiang and the rest of china however roman golden medallions from the reign of antoninus pius and possibly his successor marcus aurelius have been discovered at c eo in southern vietnam which was then part of the kingdom of funan bordering the chinese province of jiaozhi in northern vietnam this was the same region where chinese historical texts claim the romans first landed before venturing further into china to conduct diplomacy.nchinese histories offer descriptions of byzantine coins in discussing trade with india the parthian empire and the roman empire the book of jin as well as the later wenxian tongkao noted how ten ancient roman silver coins were worth one roman gold coin with fluctuations the roman golden aureus was worth about twenty-five silver denarii the history of song notes how the byzantines made coins of either silver or gold without holes in the middle yet with an inscription of the kings name.nnlaw and ordereditnfurther information roman law and byzantine lawn an 1860 sketch depicting a roman lictor a bodyguard for roman magistratesnthe history of song described forms of punishment in criminal law as they were carried out in daqin roman empire and fulin byzantine empire it states that they made a distinction between minor and major offenses with 200 strikes from a bamboo rod being reserved for major crimes it described their form of capital punishment as having the guilty person being stuffed into a feather bag and thrown into the sea this seems to correspond with the romano-byzantine punishment of poena cullei from latin punishment of the sack where those who committed parricide i.e murder of a father or mother were sewn up into a sack sometimes with wild animals and thrown into either a river or sea the history of song also mentioned how it was forbidden by law to counterfeit the coins minted by fulin these descriptions from the history of song are also found in the wenxian tongkao.nnnaming conventionseditnfurther information chinese name chinese surname and roman naming conventionsnin the chinese histories the names of romans and byzantines were often transliterated into chinese as they were heard yet occasionally the surname stemmed from their country of origin daqin for instance the roman merchant qin lun who visited the eastern wu court of sun quan in 226 ad bears the surname derived from the name for his homeland while having a given name that is perhaps derived from the greek name leon e.g leon of sparta in the han-era intermediate spoken language between old chinese and middle chinese the pronunciation for his given name lun would have sounded quite different than modern spoken mandarin k 470b liwn liun or lwn lun emc lwn or lwnh.ngranting roman individuals the surname qin followed a common chinese naming convention for foreign peoples for instance people from the parthian empire of ancient persia such as an shigao were often given the surname an derived from anxi the arsacid dynasty the sogdians an eastern iranian people from central asia were also frequently given the surname an e.g an chongzhang especially those from bukhara while sogdians from samarkand were surnamed kang e.g kang senghui derived from kangju the chinese term for transoxiana the name given for antoninus pius/marcus aurelius antoninus in the chinese
