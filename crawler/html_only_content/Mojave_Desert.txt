mojave desert wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchndesert in southwestern united statesnnthe mojave desert mohvi m mo-hah-vee is an arid rain-shadow desert and the driest desert in north america it is in the southwestern united states primarily within southeastern california and southern nevada and it occupies 47,877 sq mi 124,000 km very small areas also extend into utah and arizona its boundaries are generally noted by the presence of joshua trees which are native only to the mojave desert and are considered an indicator species and it is believed to support an additional 1,750 to 2,000 species of plants the central part of the desert is sparsely populated while its peripheries support large communities such as las vegas barstow lancaster palmdale victorville and st george.nthe mojave desert is bordered by the great basin desert to its north and the sonoran desert to its south and east topographical boundaries include the tehachapi mountains to the west and the san gabriel mountains and san bernardino mountains to the south the mountain boundaries are distinct because they are outlined by the two largest faults in california the san andreas and garlock faults the mojave desert displays typical basin and range topography higher elevations above 2,000 ft 610 m in the mojave are commonly referred to as the high desert however death valley is the lowest elevation in north america at 280 ft 85 m below sea level and is one of the mojave deserts more notorious places the mojave desert occupies less than 50,000 sq mi 130,000 km making it the smallest of the north american deserts.nthe mojave desert is often referred to as the high desert in contrast to the low desert the sonoran desert to the south however the mojave desert is generally lower than the great basin desert to the north the spelling mojave originates from the spanish language while the spelling mohave comes from modern english both are used today although the mojave tribal nation officially uses the spelling mojave the word is a shortened form of hamakhaave their endonym in their native language which means beside the water.nncontentsnnnclimateeditnthe mojave desert receives less than 2 inches 51 mm of rain a year and is generally between 2,000 and 5,000 feet 610 and 1,520 m in elevation the mojave desert also contains the mojave national preserve as well as the lowest and hottest place in north america death valley at 282 ft 86 m below sea level where the temperature often surpasses 120 f 49 c from late june to early august zion national park in utah lies at the junction of the mojave the great basin desert and the colorado plateau despite its aridity the mojave and particularly the antelope valley in its southwest has long been a center of alfalfa production fed by irrigation coming from groundwater and from the california aqueduct.nn mustard blue summer sunset at landers californianthe mojave is a desert of temperature extremes and two distinct seasons winter months bring comfortable daytime temperatures which occasionally drop to around 25 f 4 c on valley floors and below 0 f 18 c at the highest elevations storms moving from the pacific northwest can bring rain and in some places even snow more often the rain shadow created by the sierra nevada as well as mountain ranges within the desert such as the spring mountains bring only clouds and wind in longer periods between storm systems winter temperatures in valleys can approach 80 f 27 c.nspring weather continues to be influenced by pacific storms but rainfall is more widespread and occurs less often after april by early june it is rare for another pacific storm to have a significant impact on the regions weather and temperatures after the middle of may are normally above 90 f 32 c and frequently above 100 f 38 c.nsummer weather is dominated by heat temperatures on valley floors can soar above 120 f 49 c and above 130 f 54 c at the lowest elevations low humidity high temperatures and low pressure draw in moisture from the gulf of mexico creating thunderstorms across the desert southwest known as the north american monsoon while the mojave does not get nearly the amount of rainfall the sonoran desert to the south receives monsoonal moisture will create thunderstorms as far west as californias central valley from mid-june through early september.nn clouds reflecting high wind conditions from orographic lift in the mojave desertnautumn is generally pleasant with one to two pacific storm systems creating regional rain events october is one of the driest and sunniest months in the mojave and average high temperatures usually remain between 70 f 21 c and 90 f 32 c on the valley floors.nafter temperature wind is the most significant weather phenomenon in the mojave across the region windy days are common and also common in areas near the transition between the mojave and the california low valleys including near cajon pass soledad canyon and the tehachapi areas during the june gloom cooler air can be pushed into the desert from southern california in santa ana wind events hot air from the desert blows into the los angeles basin and other coastal areas wind farms in these areas generate power from these winds.nthe other major weather factor in the region is elevation the highest peak within the mojave is charleston peak at 11,918 feet 3,633 m while the badwater basin in death valley is 279 feet 85 m below sea level accordingly temperature and precipitation ranges wildly in all seasons across the region.nthe mojave desert has not historically supported a fire regime because of low fuel loads and connectivity however in the last few decades invasive annual plants such as some within the genera bromus schismus and brassica have facilitated fire this has significantly altered many areas of the desert at higher elevations fire regimes are regular but infrequent.nnnnngeographyeditnsee also the categories mountain ranges of the mojave desert valleys of the mojave desert and lakes of the mojave desert.nthe mojave desert is defined by numerous mountain ranges creating its xeric conditions these ranges often create valleys endorheic basins salt pans and seasonal saline lakes when precipitation is high enough these mountain ranges and valleys are part of the basin and range province and the great basin a geologic area of crustal thinning which pulls open valleys over millions of years most of the valleys are internally drained endorheic basins so all precipitation that falls within the valley does not eventually flow to the ocean some of the mojave toward the east in and around the colorado river/virgin river gorge is within a different geographic domain called the colorado plateau.nncities and regionseditnmain article

palms the us army also maintains fort irwin the national training center ntc which is another major training area for the united states military mojave airport is also home to a long term storage facility for large airplanes due to extremely dry non-corrosive weather conditions and a hard ground ideal for parking aircraft the airport also houses the air and space port and was one of the test centres for the virgin galactic fleet.nthe mojave desert has several ghost towns the most significant are the gold-mining town of oatman arizona the silver-mining town of calico california and the old railroad depot of kelso some of the other ghost towns are more modern created when u.s route 66 and the lesser-known u.s route 91 were abandoned in favor of the interstates the mojave desert is crossed by major highways interstate 15 interstate 40 u.s route 95 u.s route 395 and california state route 58.nother than the colorado river on the eastern half of the mojave few long streams cross the desert the mojave river is an important source of water for the southern parts of the desert the amargosa river flows from the great basin desert south to near beatty nevada then underground through ash meadows before returning to the surface near shoshone california disappearing underground again a short while later and has its final outlet into the southern end of death valley the riverbed passes under sr 127 near dumont dunes before turning north into death valley national park.nthe mojave desert is also home to the devils playground about 40 miles 64 km of dunes and salt flats going in a northwest-southeasterly direction the devils playground is a part of the mojave national preserve and is between the town of baker california and providence mountains the cronese mountains are within the devils playground.nnparks and tourismeditnthe mojave desert is one of the most popular tourism spots in north america primarily because of the gambling destination of las

considered to be outlined by the extent of growth of one of its plants the joshua tree yucca brevifolia mojave desert flora is not a vegetation type although plants in the area have evolved in isolation because of physical barriers this area includes southeastern california and smaller parts of central california southern nevada southwestern utah and northwestern arizona in the united states the flora are adapted to extremely hot and dry conditions but generally not as extreme as the adaptations needed for survival in the flora of the sonoran desert which has an overlap in its major flora such as the creosote bush larrea tridentata.nnfaunaeditnsee also category:fauna of the mojave desertnnnnsoil and plants conditionseditnthe soil types in the mojave and sonoran deserts are mostly derived from volcano specifically the areas in california as the topography goes down particle sizes decreases as you move down the gradient where you can also find low alkalinity these erosional gradient is a habitat for many plant communities as you go up the gradient of the desert you will find more pediment and alluvial fan soil in this areas the flora is mostly succulents as you move down the gradient this area is described to be the upper and lower bajada then you move into playa and salina and finally you will reach the river drought deciduous plants are found in the alluvial fans and upper bajada evergreen perennials are found in some parts of the upper bajada but it is mostly found in lower bajada once the salinity increases you will find more salt-tolerant plants in the river areas deep-rooted plants reside due to the harsh and dry conditions in the desert the plants have adapted to have succulent leaves with cam photosynthesis spines buried bulbs hairy or waxy leaves photosynthetic stems deep tap roots and ephemerals.nnwest mojave plan litigationeditnthe u.s bureau of land management blm manages public lands in the mojave desert as part of its crown jewels of the american west national landscape conservation system it has designated numerous large off-road vehicle open use areas on public lands in the western mojave desert including el mirage jawbone canyon rasor spangler hills stoddard valley dove spring canyon dumont dunes and the worlds largest open off-road vehicle use area johnson valley open areas designated for unrestricted vehicle travel in the western mojave desert total 363,480 acres 1,471.0 km several additional open areas dedicated to unrestricted vehicle travel on public lands have been designated in the northern and eastern colorado neco desert in 2002 blm designated all washes in the southeastern third of the neco planning area as also open to unrestricted vehicle travel this was followed in 2003 by blm expanding the off-road vehicle network in the western mojave desert to enhance off-road vehicle recreation opportunity in 2004 relative to the case of center for biological diversity et al plaintiffs v bureau of land management et al defendants the united states district court enjoined all off-road vehicle use in the washes of the neco desert planning area pending issuance of a new biological opinion a new biological opinion was subsequently issued and blms open wash designation in the neco planning area was reinstated in 2006 several environmental groups protested an additional route network expansion designated under the west mojave desert wemo plan.nin 2009 u.s district judge susan illston ruled against the blms proposed designation of additional off-road vehicle use allowance in the western mojave desert according to the ruling the blm violated its own regulations when it designated approximately 5,000 miles 8,000 km of off-roading routes in 2006 according to judge ilston the blms designation was significantly flawed because it does not contain a reasonable range of alternatives to limit damage to sensitive habitat judge illston found the bureau had inadequately analyzed the routes impacts on air quality soils plant communities riparian habitats and sensitive species such as the endangered mojave fringe-toed lizard pointing out that the desert and its resources are extremely fragile easily scarred and slowly healed."nthe court also found the blm failed to follow route designation procedures established in the agencys own california desert conservation area plan which allowed visitors to create hundreds of illegal ohv routes during the past three decades the plan normally requires the blm to consider the impacts to private property non-motorized recreation opportunity and natural resources before establishing off-road areas the adopted west mojave plan amendment was found to have violated the blms own manual of regulations the federal land policy and management act of 1976 flpma and the national environmental policy act of 1969 nepa the ruling was considered a success for a coalition of conservation groups including the california native plant society friends of juniper flats the alliance for responsible recreation community off-road vehicle watch the center for biological diversity sierra club and the wilderness society who together initiated the legal challenge in late 2006.nin 2011 judge illston ruled on a remedy request submitted by the ten involved environmental organizations blm in this ruling was directed to complete a revised wemo route designation complying with all laws and regulations by march 2014 the agency is also required per this ruling to place signs on all off-road vehicle routes which are legal to use create a monitoring plan to determine if illegal vehicle use is occurring and provide additional enforcement to prevent illegal use.nngalleryeditnnsee
