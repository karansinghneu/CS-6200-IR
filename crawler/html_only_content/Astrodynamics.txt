orbital mechanics wikipedia n redirected from astrodynamicsn jump to navigationnjump to searchnn a satellite orbiting the earth has a tangential velocity and an inward acceleration.nnorbital mechanics or space aerodynamics is the application of ballistics and celestial mechanics to the practical problems concerning the motion of rockets and other spacecraft the motion of these objects is usually calculated from newtons laws of motion and law of universal gravitation it is a core discipline within space-mission design and control.ncelestial mechanics treats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systems under the influence of gravity including both spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems planets moons and comets orbital mechanics focuses on spacecraft trajectories including orbital maneuvers orbital plane changes and interplanetary transfers and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers general relativity is a more exact theory than newtons laws for calculating orbits and is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or in high-gravity situations e.g orbits near the sun.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnnuntil the rise of space travel in the twentieth century there was little distinction between orbital and celestial mechanics at the time of sputnik the field was termed space dynamics the fundamental techniques such as those used to solve the keplerian problem determining position as a function of time are therefore the same in both fields furthermore the history of the fields are almost entirely shared.njohannes kepler was the first to successfully model planetary orbits to a high degree of accuracy publishing his laws in 1605 isaac newton published more general laws of celestial motion in the first edition of philosophi naturalis principia mathematica 1687 which gave a method for finding the orbit of a body following a parabolic path from three observations this was used by edmund halley to establish the orbits of various comets including that which bears his name newtons method of successive approximation was formalised into an analytic method by euler in 1744 whose work was in turn generalised to elliptical and hyperbolic orbits by lambert in 1761-1777.nanother milestone in orbit determination was carl friedrich gausss assistance in the recovery of the dwarf planet ceres in 1801 gausss method was able to use just three observations in the form of pairs of right ascension and declination to find the six orbital elements that completely describe an orbit the theory of orbit determination has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in gps receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed minor planets.nnpractical techniqueseditnfurther information list of orbitsnrules of thumbeditnthe following rules of thumb are useful for situations approximated by classical mechanics under the standard assumptions of astrodynamics outlined below the rules the specific example discussed is of a satellite orbiting a planet but the rules of thumb could also apply to other situations such as orbits of small bodies around a star such as the sun.nnnthe consequences of the rules of orbital mechanics are sometimes counter-intuitive for example if two spacecraft are in the same circular orbit and wish to dock unless they are very close the trailing craft cannot simply fire its engines to go faster this will change the shape of its orbit causing it to gain altitude and actually slow down relative to the leading craft missing the target the space rendezvous before docking normally takes multiple precisely calculated engine firings in multiple orbital periods requiring hours or even days to complete.nto the degree that the standard assumptions of astrodynamics do not hold actual trajectories will vary from those calculated for example simple atmospheric drag is another complicating factor for objects in low earth orbit these rules of thumb are decidedly inaccurate when describing two or more bodies of similar mass such as a binary star system see n-body problem celestial mechanics uses more general rules applicable to a wider variety of situations keplers laws of planetary motion which can be mathematically derived from newtons laws hold strictly only in describing the motion of two gravitating bodies in the absence of non-gravitational forces they also describe parabolic and hyperbolic trajectories in the close proximity of large objects like stars the differences between classical mechanics and general relativity also become important.nnlaws of astrodynamicseditnsee also laplacerungelenz vectornthe fundamental laws of astrodynamics are newtons law of universal gravitation and newtons laws of motion while the fundamental mathematical tool is his differential calculus.nevery orbit and trajectory outside atmospheres is in principle reversible i.e in the space-time function the time is reversed the velocities are reversed and the accelerations are the same including those due to rocket bursts thus if a rocket burst is in the direction of the velocity in the reversed case it is opposite to the velocity of course in the case of rocket bursts there is no full reversal of events both ways the same delta-v is used and the same mass ratio applies.nstandard assumptions in astrodynamics include non-interference from outside bodies negligible mass for one of the bodies and negligible other forces such as from the solar wind atmospheric drag etc more accurate calculations can be made without these simplifying assumptions but they are more complicated the increased accuracy often does not make enough of a difference in the calculation to be worthwhile.nkeplers laws of planetary motion may be derived from newtons laws when it is assumed that the orbiting body is subject only to the gravitational force of the central attractor when an engine thrust or propulsive force is present newtons laws still apply but keplers laws are invalidated when the thrust stops the resulting orbit will be different but will once again be described by keplers laws the three laws are:nnnescape velocityeditnmain article escape velocitynthe formula for an escape velocity is easily derived as follows the specific energy energy per unit mass of any space vehicle is composed of two components the specific potential energy and the specific kinetic energy the specific potential energy associated with a planet of mass m is given bynnnwhile the specific kinetic energy of an object is given bynnnsince energy is conserved,nnnand so the total specific orbital energynnndoes not depend on the distance from the center of the central body to the space vehicle in question therefore the object can reach infinite only if this quantity is nonnegative which impliesnnnthe escape velocity from the earths surface is about 11 km/s but that is insufficient to send the body an infinite distance because of the gravitational pull of the sun to escape the solar system from a location at a distance from the sun equal to the distance sunearth but not close to the earth requires around 42 km/s velocity but there will be part credit for the earths orbital velocity for spacecraft launched from earth if their further acceleration due to the propulsion system carries them in the same direction as earth travels in its orbit.nnformulae for free orbitseditnorbits are conic sections so the formula for the distance of a body for a given angle corresponds to the formula for that curve in polar coordinates which is:nnnnn is called the gravitational parameter and are the masses of objects 1 and 2 and is the specific angular momentum of object 2 with respect to object 1 the parameter is known as the true anomaly is the semi-latus rectum while is the orbital eccentricity all obtainable from the various forms of the six independent orbital elements.nncircular orbitseditnall bounded orbits where the gravity of a central body dominates are elliptical in nature a special case of this is the circular orbit which is an ellipse of zero eccentricity the formula for the velocity of a body in a circular orbit at distance r from the center of gravity of mass m can be derived as follows ncentrifugal acceleration matches the acceleration due to gravity.nso ntherefore,nnnwhere is the gravitational constant equal tonnnto properly use this formula the units must be consistent for example must be in kilograms and must be in meters the answer will be in meters per second.nthe quantity is often termed the standard gravitational parameter which has a different value for every planet or moon in the solar system.nonce the circular orbital velocity is known the escape velocity is easily found by multiplying by the square root of 2:nnnto escape from gravity the kinetic energy must at least match the negative potential energy.nso and therefore,nnnelliptical orbitseditnif then the denominator of the equation of free orbits varies with the true anomaly but remains positive never becoming zero therefore the relative position vector remains bounded having its smallest magnitude at

the eccentric anomaly and is the eccentricity.nwith keplers formula finding the time-of-flight to reach an angle true anomaly of from periapsis is broken into two steps:nnnfinding the eccentric anomaly at a given time the inverse problem is more difficult keplers equation is transcendental in meaning it cannot be solved for algebraically keplers equation can be solved for analytically by inversion.na solution of keplers equation valid for all real values of is:nnevaluating this yields:nnnalternatively keplers equation can be solved numerically first one must guess a value of and solve for time-of-flight then adjust as necessary to bring the computed time-of-flight closer to the desired value until the required precision is achieved usually newtons method is used to achieve relatively fast convergence.nthe main difficulty with this approach is that it can take prohibitively long to converge for the extreme elliptical orbits for near-parabolic orbits eccentricity is nearly 1 and plugging into the formula for mean anomaly we find ourselves subtracting two nearly-equal values and accuracy suffers for near-circular orbits it is hard to find the periapsis in the first place and truly circular orbits have no periapsis at all furthermore the equation was derived on the assumption of an elliptical orbit and so it does not hold for parabolic or hyperbolic orbits these difficulties are what led to the development of the universal variable formulation described below.nnconic orbitseditnfor simple procedures such as computing the delta-v for coplanar transfer ellipses traditional approaches are fairly effective others such as time-of-flight are far more complicated especially for near-circular and hyperbolic orbits.nnthe patched conic approximationeditnmain article patched conic approximationnthe hohmann transfer orbit alone is a poor approximation for interplanetary trajectories because it neglects the planets own gravity planetary gravity dominates the behaviour of the spacecraft in the vicinity of a planet and in most cases hohmann severely overestimates delta-v and produces highly inaccurate prescriptions for burn timings.na relatively simple way to get a first-order approximation of delta-v is based on the patched conic approximation technique one must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass and to model only that bodys effects in that region for instance on a trajectory from the earth to mars one would begin by considering only the earths gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the earths gravity no longer dominates that of the sun the spacecraft would be given escape velocity to send it on its way to interplanetary space next one would consider only the suns gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighbourhood of mars during this stage the transfer orbit model is appropriate finally only marss gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where marss gravity dominates the spacecrafts behaviour the spacecraft would approach mars on a hyperbolic orbit and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by mars.nthe size of the neighborhoods or spheres of influence vary with radius nnnwhere is the semimajor axis of the planets orbit relative to the sun and are the masses of the planet and sun respectively.nthis simplification is sufficient to compute rough estimates of fuel requirements and rough time-of-flight estimates but it is not generally accurate enough to guide a spacecraft to its destination for that numerical methods are required.nnthe universal variable formulationeditnto address computational shortcomings of traditional approaches for solving the 2-body problem the universal variable formulation was developed it works equally well for the circular elliptical parabolic and hyperbolic cases the differential equations converging well when integrated for any orbit it also generalizes well to problems incorporating perturbation theory.nnperturbationseditnthe universal variable formulation works well with the variation of parameters technique except now instead of the six keplerian orbital elements we use a different set of orbital elements namely the satellites initial position and velocity vectors and at a given epoch in a two-body simulation these elements are sufficient to compute the satellites position and velocity at any time in the future using the universal variable formulation conversely at any moment in the satellites orbit we can measure its position and velocity and then use the universal variable approach to determine what its initial position and velocity would have been at the epoch in perfect two-body motion these orbital elements would be invariant just like the keplerian elements would be.nhowever perturbations cause the orbital elements to change over time hence we write the position element as and the velocity element as indicating that they vary with time the technique to compute the effect of perturbations becomes one of finding expressions either exact or approximate for the functions and nthe following are some effects which make real orbits differ from the simple models based on a spherical earth most of them can be handled on short timescales perhaps less than a few thousand orbits by perturbation theory because they are small relative to the corresponding two-body effects.nnnover very long timescales perhaps millions of orbits even small perturbations can dominate and the behaviour can become chaotic on the other hand the various perturbations can be orchestrated by clever astrodynamicists to assist with orbit maintenance tasks such as station-keeping ground track maintenance or adjustment or phasing of perigee to cover selected targets at low altitude.nnorbital maneuvereditnmain article orbital maneuvernin spaceflight an orbital maneuver is the use of propulsion systems to change the orbit of a spacecraft for spacecraft far from earthfor example those in orbits around the sunan orbital maneuver is called a deep-space maneuver dsm.nnorbital transfereditntransfer orbits are usually elliptical orbits that allow spacecraft to move from one usually substantially circular orbit to another usually they require a burn at the start a burn at the end and sometimes one or more burns in the middle.nnnfor the case of orbital transfer between non-coplanar orbits the change-of-plane thrust must be made at the point where the orbital planes intersect the node as the objective is to change the direction of the velocity vector by an angle equal to the angle between the planes almost all of this thrust should be made when the spacecraft is at the node near the apoapse when the magnitude of the velocity vector is at its lowest however a small fraction of the orbital inclination change can be made at the node near the periapse by slightly angling the transfer orbit injection thrust in the direction of the desired inclination change this works because the cosine of a small angle is very nearly one resulting in the small plane change being effectively free despite the high velocity of the spacecraft near periapse as the oberth effect due to the increased slightly angled thrust exceeds the cost of the thrust in the orbit-normal axis.nna hohmann transfer from a low circular orbit to a higher circular orbita bi-elliptic transfer from a low circular starting orbit dark blue to a higher circular orbit redgeneric two-impulse elliptical transfer between two circular orbitsa general transfer from a low circular orbit to a higher circular orbitan optimal sequence for transferring a satellite from a supersynchronous to a geosynchronous orbit using electric propulsionngravity assist and the oberth effecteditnin a gravity assist a spacecraft swings by a planet and leaves in a different direction at a different speed this is useful to speed or slow a spacecraft instead of carrying more fuel.nthis maneuver can be approximated by an elastic collision at large distances though the flyby does not involve any physical contact due to newtons third law equal and opposite reaction any momentum gained by a spacecraft must be lost by the planet or vice versa however because the planet is much much more massive than the spacecraft the effect on the planets orbit is negligible.nthe oberth effect can be employed particularly during a gravity assist operation this effect is that use of a propulsion system works better at high speeds and hence course changes are best done when close to a gravitating body this can multiply the effective delta-v.nninterplanetary transport network and fuzzy orbitseditnmain article interplanetary transport networknsee also low energy transfersnit is now possible to use computers to search for routes using the nonlinearities in the gravity of the planets and moons of the solar system for example it is possible to plot an orbit from high earth orbit to mars passing close to one of the earths trojan points collectively referred to as the interplanetary transport network these highly perturbative even chaotic orbital trajectories in principle need no fuel beyond that needed to reach the lagrange point in practice keeping to the trajectory requires some course corrections the biggest problem with them is they can be exceedingly slow taking many years in addition launch windows can be very far apart.nthey have however been employed on projects such as genesis this spacecraft visited the earth-sun l point and returned using very little propellant.nnsee alsoeditnnnnnnreferenceseditnnnnnnfurther readingeditnmany of the options procedures and supporting theory are
