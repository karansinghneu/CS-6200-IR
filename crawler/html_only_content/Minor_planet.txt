of bodies in the solar systemna minor planet is an astronomical object in direct orbit around the sun or more broadly any star with a planetary system that is neither a planet nor exclusively classified as a comet before 2006 the international astronomical union iau officially used the term minor planet but during that years meeting it reclassified minor planets and comets into dwarf planets and small solar system bodies sssbs.nminor planets can be dwarf planets asteroids trojans centaurs kuiper belt objects and other trans-neptunian objects as of 2018 the orbits of 757,626 minor planets were archived at the minor planet center 516,386 of which had received permanent numbers for the complete list see index.nthe first minor planet to be discovered was ceres in 1801 the term minor planet has been used since the 19th century to describe these objects the term planetoid has also been used especially for larger planetary objects such as those the international astronomical union iau has called dwarf planets since 2006 historically the terms asteroid minor planet and planetoid have been more or less synonymous this terminology has become more complicated by the discovery of numerous minor planets beyond the orbit of jupiter especially trans-neptunian objects that are generally not considered asteroids a minor planet seen releasing gas may be dually classified as a comet.nobjects are called dwarf planets if their own gravity is sufficient to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium and form an ellipsoidal shape all other minor planets and comets are called small solar system bodies the iau stated that the term minor planet may still be used but the term small solar system body will be preferred however for purposes of numbering and naming the traditional distinction between minor planet and comet is still used.nncontentsnnnpopulationseditnmain article list of minor-planet groupsnhundreds of thousands of minor planets have been discovered within the solar system and thousands more are discovered each month the minor planet center has documented over 188 million observations and 757,626 minor planets of which 516,386 have orbits known well enough to be assigned permanent official numbers of these 21,787 have official names as of 30 december 2018 the lowest-numbered unnamed minor planet is 3708 1974 fv1 and the highest-numbered named minor planet is 516560 annapolisroyal.nthere are various broad minor-planet populations:nnnnaming conventionseditnmain article astronomical naming conventions minor planetsn out of a total of more than 700,000 discovered minor planets 66 have been numbered green and 34 remain unnumbered red only a small fraction of 20,071 minor planets 3 have been named purple.nall astronomical bodies in the solar system need a distinct designation the naming of minor planets runs through a three-step process first a provisional designation is given upon discoverybecause the object still may turn out to be a false positive or become lost later oncalled a provisionally designated minor planet after the observation arc is accurate enough to predict its future location a minor planet is formally designated and receives a number it is then a numbered minor planet finally in the third step it may be named by its discoverers however only a small fraction of all minor planets have been named the vast majority is either numbered or has still only a provisional designation example of the naming process:nnnprovisional designationeditnmain article provisional designation in astronomyna newly discovered minor planet is given a provisional designation for example the provisional designation 2002 at4 consists of the year of discovery 2002 and an alphanumeric code indicating the half-month of discovery and the sequence within that half-month once an asteroids orbit has been confirmed it is given a number and later may also be given a name e.g 433 eros the formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number but dropping the parentheses is quite common informally it is common to drop the number altogether or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.nminor planets that have been given a number but not a name keep their provisional designation e.g 29075 1950 da because modern discovery techniques are finding vast numbers of new asteroids they are increasingly being left unnamed the earliest discovered to be left unnamed was for a long time 3360 1981 va now 3360 syrinx as of september 2008 this distinction is held by 3708 1974 fv1 on rare occasions a small objects provisional designation may become used as a name in itself the then unnamed 15760 1992 qb1 gave its name to a group of objects that became known as classical kuiper belt objects cubewanos before it was finally named 15760 albion in january 2018.na few objects are cross-listed as both comets and asteroids such as 4015 wilsonharrington which is also listed as 107p/wilsonharrington.nnnumberingeditnmain article minor planet designationnminor planets are awarded an official number once their orbits are confirmed with the increasing rapidity of discovery these are now six-figure numbers the switch from five figures to six figures arrived with the publication of the minor planet circular mpc of october 19 2005 which saw the highest numbered minor planet jump from 99947 to 118161.nnnamingeditnmain article name conflicts with minor planetsnthe first few asteroids were named after figures from greek and roman mythology but as such names started to dwindle the names of famous people literary characters discoverers wives children and even television characters were used.nngendereditnneccentriceditnndiscoverers
