cassinihuygens wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnthe cassinihuygens mission ksini hnz k-see-nee hoy-gnz commonly called cassini was a collaboration between nasa the european space agency esa and the italian space agency asi to send a probe to study the planet saturn and its system including its rings and natural satellites the flagship-class robotic spacecraft comprised both nasas cassini probe and esas huygens lander which landed on saturns largest moon titan cassini was the fourth space probe to visit saturn and the first to enter its orbit the craft were named after astronomers giovanni cassini and christiaan huygens.nlaunched aboard a titan ivb/centaur on october 15 1997 cassini was active in space for nearly 20 years with 13 years spent orbiting saturn studying the planet and its system after entering orbit on july 1 2004 the voyage to saturn included flybys of venus april 1998 and july 1999 earth august 1999 the asteroid 2685 masursky and jupiter december 2000 its mission ended on september 15 2017 when cassinis trajectory took it into saturns upper atmosphere and it burned up in order to prevent any risk of contaminating saturns moons which might have offered habitable environments to stowaway terrestrial microbes on the spacecraft the mission is widely perceived to have been successful beyond expectation cassini-huygens has been described by nasas planetary science division director as a mission of firsts that has revolutionized human understanding of the saturn system including its moons and rings and our understanding of where life might be found in the solar system.ncassinis original mission was planned to last for four years from june 2004 to may 2008 the mission was extended for another two years until september 2010 branded the cassini equinox mission the mission was extended a second and final time with the cassini solstice mission lasting another seven years until september 15 2017 on which date cassini was de-orbited to burn up in saturns upper atmosphere.nthe huygens module traveled with cassini until its separation from the probe on december 25 2004 it was landed by parachute on titan on january 14 2005 it returned data to earth for around 90 minutes using the orbiter as a relay this was the first landing ever accomplished in the outer solar system and the first landing on a moon other than our own.nat the end of its mission the cassini spacecraft executed the grand finale of its mission a number of risky passes through the gaps between saturn and saturns inner rings the purpose of this phase was to maximize cassinis scientific outcome before the spacecraft was disposed the atmospheric entry of cassini ended the mission but analyses of the returned data will continue for many years.nncontentsnnnovervieweditnteams from 28 countries made up the joint team responsible for designing building flying and collecting data from the cassini orbiter and huygens probe.nthe mission was managed by nasas jet propulsion laboratory in the united states where the orbiter was assembled huygens was developed by the european space research and technology centre the centres prime contractor arospatiale of france now thales alenia space assembled the probe with equipment and instruments supplied by many european countries huygens batteries and two scientific instruments by the united states the italian space agency asi provided the cassini orbiters high-gain radio antenna with the incorporation of a low-gain antenna to ensure telecommunications with the earth for the entire duration of the mission a compact and lightweight radar which also uses the high-gain antenna and serves as a synthetic-aperture radar a radar altimeter a radiometer the radio science subsystem rss the visible channel portion vims-v of vims spectrometer.nthe vims infrared counterpart was provided by nasa as well as main electronic assembly which includes electronic subassemblies provided by cnes of france.non april 16 2008 nasa announced a two-year extension of the funding for ground operations of this mission at which point it was renamed the cassini equinox mission the round of funding was again extended in february 2010 with the cassini solstice mission.nnnamingeditn huygens explanation for the aspects of saturn systema saturnium 1659nthe mission consisted of two main elements the asi/nasa cassini orbiter named for the italian astronomer giovanni domenico cassini discoverer of saturns ring divisions and four of its satellites and the esa-developed huygens probe named for the dutch astronomer mathematician and physicist christiaan huygens discoverer of titan.nthe mission was commonly called saturn orbiter titan probe sotp during gestation both as a mariner mark ii mission and generically.ncassini-huygens was a flagship-class mission to the outer planets the other planetary flagships include galileo voyager and viking.nnobjectiveseditncassini had several objectives including:nnncassinihuygens was launched on october 15 1997 from cape canaveral air force stations space launch complex 40 using a u.s air force titan ivb/centaur rocket the complete launcher was made up of a two-stage titan iv booster rocket two strap-on solid rocket engines the centaur upper stage and a payload enclosure or fairing.nthe total cost of this scientific exploration mission was about us$3.26 billion including 1.4 billion for pre-launch development 704 million for mission operations 54 million for tracking and 422 million for the launch vehicle the united states contributed 2.6 billion 80 the esa 500 million 15 and the asi 160 million 5 however these figures are from the press kit which was prepared in october 2000 they do not include inflation over the course of a very long mission nor do they include the cost of the extended missions.nthe primary mission for cassini was completed on july 30 2008 the mission was extended to june 2010 cassini equinox mission this studied the saturn system in detail during the planets equinox which happened in august 2009.non february 3 2010 nasa announced another extension for cassini lasting 6 years until 2017 ending at the time of summer solstice in saturns northern hemisphere cassini solstice mission the extension enabled another 155 revolutions around the planet 54 flybys of titan and 11 flybys of enceladus.nin 2017 an encounter with titan changed its orbit in such a way that at closest approach to saturn it was only 3,000 km above the planets cloudtops below the inner edge of the d ring this sequence of proximal orbits ended when its final encounter with titan sent the probe into saturns atmosphere to be destroyed.nnitineraryeditnnnnhistoryeditn cassini-huygens on the launch padncassinihuygenss origins date to 1982 when the european science foundation and the american national academy of sciences formed a working group to investigate future cooperative missions two european scientists suggested a paired saturn orbiter and titan probe as a possible joint mission in 1983 nasas solar system exploration committee recommended the same orbiter and probe pair as a core nasa project nasa and the european space agency esa performed a joint study of the potential mission from 1984 to 1985 esa continued with its own study in 1986 while the american astronaut sally ride in her influential 1987 report nasa leadership and americas future in space also examined and approved of the cassini mission.nwhile rides report described the saturn orbiter and probe as a nasa solo mission in 1988 the associate administrator for space science and applications of nasa len fisk returned to the idea of a joint nasa and esa mission he wrote to his counterpart at esa roger bonnet strongly suggesting that esa choose the cassini mission from the three candidates at hand and promising that nasa would commit to the mission as soon as esa did.nat the time nasa was becoming more sensitive to the strain that had developed between the american and european space programs as a result of european perceptions that nasa had not treated it like an equal during previous collaborations nasa officials and advisers involved in promoting and planning cassinihuygens attempted to correct this trend by stressing their desire to evenly share any scientific and technology benefits resulting from the mission in part this newfound spirit of cooperation with europe was driven by a sense of competition with the soviet union which had begun to cooperate more closely with europe as esa drew further away from nasa late in 1988 esa chose cassinihuygens as its next major mission and the following year the program received major funding in the us.nthe collaboration not only improved relations between the two space programs but also helped cassinihuygens survive congressional budget cuts in the united states cassinihuygens came under fire politically in both 1992 and 1994 but nasa successfully persuaded the united states congress that it would be unwise to halt the project after esa had already poured funds into development because frustration on broken space exploration promises might spill over into other areas of foreign relations the project proceeded politically smoothly after 1994 although citizens groups concerned about its potential environmental impact attempted to derail it through protests and lawsuits until and past its 1997 launch.nnspacecraft designeditn cassini-huygens assemblynthe spacecraft was planned to be the second three-axis stabilized rtg-powered mariner mark ii a class of spacecraft developed for missions beyond the orbit of mars cassini was developed simultaneously with the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf spacecraft but budget cuts and project rescopings forced nasa to terminate craf development to save cassini as a result cassini became more specialized the mariner mark ii series was cancelled.nthe combined orbiter and probe is the third-largest unmanned interplanetary spacecraft ever successfully launched behind the phobos 1 and 2 mars probes as well as being among the most complex the orbiter had a mass of 2,150 kg 4,740 lb the probe 350 kg 770 lb with the launch vehicle adapter and 3,132 kg 6,905 lb of propellants at launch the spacecraft had a mass of 5,600 kg 12,300 lb.nthe cassini spacecraft was 6.8 meters 22 ft high and 4 meters 13 ft wide spacecraft complexity was increased by its trajectory flight path to saturn and by the ambitious science at its destination cassini had 1,630 interconnected electronic components 22,000 wire connections and 14 kilometers 8.7 mi of cabling the core control computer cpu was a redundant mil-std-1750a system the main propulsion system consisted of one prime and one backup r-4d bipropellant rocket engine the thrust of each engine was 490 newtons and the total spacecraft delta-v was about 2,040 meters per second smaller monopropellant rockets provided attitude control.ncassini was powered by 32.7 kg of plutonium-238the heat from the materials radioactive decay was turned into electricity huygens was supported by cassini during cruise but used chemical batteries when independent.nthe probe contained a dvd with more than 616,400 signatures from citizens in 81 countries collected in a public campaign.nuntil september 2017 the cassini probe continued orbiting saturn at a distance of between 8.2 and 10.2 astronomical units from the earth it took 68 to 84 minutes for radio signals to travel from earth to the spacecraft and vice versa thus ground controllers could not give real-time instructions for daily operations or for unexpected events even if response were immediate more than two hours would have passed between the occurrence of a problem and the reception of the engineers response by the satellite.nninstrumentseditn titans surface revealed by vimsn rhea in front of saturnn saturns north polar hexagonn saturn in natural-color july 2018n animated 3d model of the

spectrometer a composite infrared spectrometer a cosmic dust analyzer a radio and plasma wave experiment a plasma spectrometer an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph a magnetospheric imaging instrument a magnetometer and an ion/neutral mass spectrometer telemetry from the communications antenna and other special transmitters an s-band transmitter and a dual-frequency k-band system was also used to make observations of the atmospheres of titan and saturn and to measure the gravity fields of the planet and its satellites.nnnnnnnnnnnn vims spectra taken while looking through titans atmosphere towards the sun helped understand the atmospheres of exoplanets artists concept may 27 2014.nnnplutonium power sourceeditn a cassini rtg before installationnbecause of saturns distance from the sun solar arrays were not feasible as power sources for this space probe to generate enough power such arrays would have been too large and too heavy instead the cassini orbiter was powered by three radioisotope thermoelectric generators rtgs which use heat from the natural decay of about 33 kg 73 lb of plutonium-238 in the form of plutonium dioxide to generate direct current electricity via thermoelectrics.nthe rtgs on the cassini mission have the same design as those used on the new horizons galileo and ulysses space probes and they were designed to have very long operational lifetimes.nat the end of the nominal 11-year cassini mission they were still able to produce 600 to 700 watts of electrical power one of the spare rtgs for the cassini mission was used to power the new horizons mission to pluto and the kuiper belt which was designed and launched later.nn a glowing-hot plutonium pellet that is the power source of the probes radioisotope thermoelectric generatornto gain momentum while already in flight the trajectory of the cassini mission included several gravitational slingshot maneuvers two fly-by passes of venus one more of the earth and then one of the planet jupiter the terrestrial flyby was the final instance when the probe posed any conceivable danger to human beings the maneuver was successful with cassini passing by 1,171 km 728 mi above the earth on august 18 1999.nhad there been any malfunction causing the probe to collide with the earth nasas complete environmental impact study estimated that in the worst case with an acute angle of entry in which cassini would gradually burn up a significant fraction of the 33 kg of plutonium-238 inside the rtgs would have been dispersed into the earths atmosphere so that up to five billion people i.e almost the entire terrestrial population could have been exposed causing up to an estimated 5,000 additional cancer deaths over the subsequent decades 0.0005 per cent i.e a fraction 0.000005 of a billion cancer deaths expected anyway from other causes the product is incorrectly calculated elsewhere as 500,000 deaths however the chance of this happening were estimated to be less than one in one million.nntelemetryeditnthe cassini spacecraft was capable of transmitting in several different telemetry formats the telemetry subsystem is perhaps the most important subsystem because without it there could be no data return.nthe telemetry was developed from ground up due to the spacecraft using a more modern set of computers than previous missions therefore cassini was the first spacecraft to adopt mini-packets to reduce the complexity of the telemetry dictionary and the software development process led to the creation of a telemetry manager for the mission.nthere were around 1088 channels in 67 mini-packets assembled in the cassini telemetry dictionary out of these 67 lower complexity mini-packets 6 mini-packets contained the subsystem covariance and kalman gain elements 161 measurements not used during normal mission operations this left 947 measurements in 61 mini-packets.na total of seven telemetry maps corresponding to 7 aacs telemetry modes were constructed these modes are 1 record 2 nominal cruise 3 medium slow cruise 4 slow cruise 5 orbital ops 6 av 7 ate attitude estimator calibration these 7 maps cover all spacecraft telemetry modes.nnhuygens probeeditnmain article huygens spacecraftnhuygens view of titans surfacesame image with different data processingnthe huygens probe supplied by the european space agency esa and named after the 17th century dutch astronomer who first discovered titan christiaan huygens scrutinized the clouds atmosphere and surface of saturns moon titan in its descent on january 15 2005 it was designed to enter and brake in titans atmosphere and parachute a fully instrumented robotic laboratory down to the surface.nthe probe system consisted of the probe itself which descended to titan and the probe support equipment pse which remained attached to the orbiting spacecraft the pse includes electronics that track the probe recover the data gathered during its descent and process and deliver the data to the orbiter that transmits it to earth the core control computer cpu was a redundant mil-std-1750a control system.nthe data were transmitted by a radio link between huygens and cassini provided by probe data relay subsystem pdrs as the probes mission could not be telecommanded from earth because of the great distance it was automatically managed by the command data management subsystem cdms the pdrs and cdms were provided by the italian space agency asi.nafter cassinis launch it was discovered that data sent back from the probe to european space agencys mission control center was largely unreadable it was determined that cassinis receiver was unable to accurately process the changes in frequency and wavelength of the signal it would be receiving from huygens during its descent to titan the problem was rectified by changing the distance and angle of cassinis trajectory to huygens during the landing.nnnselected events and discoverieseditnmain article

gravitational-assist flybys of venus on april 26 1998 and june 24 1999 these flybys provided the space probe with enough momentum to travel all the way out to the asteroid belt at that point the suns gravity pulled the space probe back into the inner solar system.non august 18 1999 at 03:28 utc the craft made a gravitational-assist flyby of the earth one hour and 20 minutes before closest approach cassini made its closest approach to the earths moon at 377,000 kilometers and it took a series of calibration photos.non january 23 2000 cassini performed a flyby of the asteroid 2685 masursky at around 10:00 utc it took photos in the period five to seven hours before the flyby at a distance of 1.6 million kilometers and a diameter of 15 to 20 km was estimated for the asteroid.nnjupiter flybyeditnn a jupiter flyby picturencassini made its closest approach to jupiter on december 30 2000 and made many scientific measurements about 26,000 images of jupiter its faint rings and its moons were taken during the six-month flyby it produced the most detailed global color portrait of the planet yet see image at right in which the smallest visible features are approximately 60 km 37 mi across.nn cassini photographed io transiting jupiter on january 1 2001.na major finding of the flyby announced on march 6 2003 was of jupiters atmospheric circulation dark belts alternate with light zones in the atmosphere and scientists had long considered the zones with their pale clouds to be areas of upwelling air partly because many clouds on earth form where air is rising but analysis of cassini imagery showed that individual storm cells of upwelling bright-white clouds too small to see from earth pop up almost without exception in the dark belts according to anthony del genio of nasas goddard institute for space studies the belts must be the areas of net-rising atmospheric motion on jupiter so the net motion in the zones has to be sinking."nother atmospheric observations included a swirling dark oval of high atmospheric haze about the size of the great red spot near jupiters north pole infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles with bands of globe-encircling winds with adjacent bands moving in opposite directions.nthe same announcement also discussed the nature of jupiters rings light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped rather than spherical and likely originate as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on jupiters moons probably metis and adrastea.nntests of general relativityeditnon october 10 2003 the missions science team announced the results of tests of albert einsteins general theory of relativity performed by using radio waves transmitted from the cassini space probe the radio scientists measured a frequency shift in the radio waves to and from the spacecraft as those passed close to the sun according to the general theory of relativity a massive object like the sun causes space-time to curve causing a beam of radiowaves or light or any form of electromagnetic radiation that passes by the sun to travel farther known as the shapiro time delay.nalthough some measurable deviations from the values calculated using the general theory of relativity are predicted by some unusual cosmological models no such deviations were found by this experiment previous tests using radiowaves transmitted by the viking and voyager space probes were in agreement with the calculated values from general relativity to within an accuracy of one part in one thousand the more refined measurements from the cassini space probe experiment improved this accuracy to about one part in 51,000 the data firmly support einsteins general theory of relativity.nnnew moons of saturneditn the possible formation of a new moon was captured on april 15 2013.nin total the cassini mission discovered seven new moons orbiting saturn using images taken by cassini researchers discovered methone pallene and polydeuces in 2004 although later analysis revealed that voyager 2 had photographed pallene in its 1981 flyby of the ringed planet.nn discovery photograph of moon daphnisnon may 1 2005 a new moon was discovered by cassini in the keeler gap it was given the designation s/2005 s 1 before being named daphnis a fifth new moon was discovered by cassini on may 30 2007 and was provisionally labeled s/2007 s 4 it is now known as anthe a press release on february 3 2009 showed a sixth new moon found by cassini the moon is approximately 1/3 of a mile 500 m in diameter within the g-ring of the ring system of saturn and is now named aegaeon formerly s/2008 s 1 a press release on november 2 2009 mentions the seventh new moon found by cassini on july 26 2009 it is presently labeled s/2009 s 1 and is approximately 300 m 1000 ft in diameter in the b-ring system.non april 14 2014 nasa scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon in saturns a ring.nnphoebe flybyeditn cassini arrival left and departure mosaics of phoebe 2004non june 11 2004 cassini flew by the moon phoebe this was the first opportunity for close-up studies of this moon voyager 2 performed a distant flyby in 1981 but returned no detailed images it also was cassinis only possible flyby for phoebe due to the mechanics of the available orbits around saturn.nthe first close-up images were received on june 12 2004 and mission scientists immediately realized that the surface of phoebe looks different from asteroids visited by spacecraft parts of the heavily cratered surface look very bright in those pictures and it is currently believed that a large amount of water ice exists under its immediate surface.nnsaturn rotationeditnin an announcement on june 28 2004 cassini program scientists described the measurement of the rotational period of saturn because there are no fixed features on the surface that can be used to obtain this period the repetition of radio emissions was used this new data agreed with the latest values measured from earth and constituted a puzzle to the scientists it turns out that the radio rotational period had changed since it was first measured in 1980 by voyager 1 and it was now 6 minutes longer this however does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet it is thought to be due to variations in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere at the latitudes which are magnetically connected to the radio source region.nnorbiting saturneditn saturn reached equinox in 2008 shortly after the end of the prime mission.non july 1 2004 the spacecraft flew through the gap between the f and g rings and achieved orbit after a seven-year voyage it was the first spacecraft to ever orbit saturn.nthe saturn orbital insertion soi maneuver performed by cassini was complex requiring the craft to orient its high-gain antenna away from earth and along its flight path to shield its instruments from particles in saturns rings once the craft crossed the ring plane it had to rotate again to point its engine along its flight path and then the engine fired to decelerate the craft by 622 meters/s to allow saturn to capture it cassini was captured by saturns gravity at around 8:54 pm pacific daylight time on june 30 2004 during the maneuver cassini passed within 20,000 km 12,000 mi of saturns cloud tops.nwhen cassini was in saturnian orbit departure from the saturn system was evaluated in 2008 during end of mission planning.nntitan flybyseditn titan infrared views 2004 2017ncassini had its first flyby of saturns largest moon titan on july 2 2004 a day after orbit insertion when it approached to within 339,000 km 211,000 mi of titan images taken through special filters able to see through the moons global haze showed south polar clouds thought to be composed of methane and surface features with widely differing brightness on october 27 2004 the spacecraft executed the first of the 45 planned close flybys of titan when it passed a mere 1,200 kilometers above the moon almost four gigabits of data were collected and transmitted to earth including the first radar images of the moons haze-enshrouded surface it revealed the surface of titan at least the area covered by radar to be relatively level with topography reaching no more than about 50 meters in altitude the flyby provided a remarkable increase in imaging resolution over previous coverage images with up to 100 times better resolution were taken and are typical of resolutions planned for subsequent titan flybys cassini collected pictures of titan and the lakes of methane were similar to the lakes of earth.nnhuygens lands on titaneditnmain article huygens spacecraftnncassini released the huygens probe on december 25 2004 by means of a spring and spiral rails intended to rotate the probe for greater stability it entered the atmosphere of titan on january 14 2005 and after a two-and-a-half-hour descent landed on solid ground although cassini successfully relayed 350 of the pictures that it received from huygens of its descent and landing site a software error failed to turn on one of the cassini receivers and caused the loss of another 350 pictures while landing for caution nasa loaded huygens with 3 parachutes.nnenceladus flybyseditn view of enceladuss europa-like surface with the labtayt sulci fractures at center and the ebony left and cufa dorsa at lower left imaged by cassini on february 17 2005nduring the first two close flybys of the moon enceladus in 2005 cassini discovered a deflection in the local magnetic field that is characteristic for the existence of a thin but significant atmosphere other measurements obtained at that time point to ionized water vapor as its main constituent cassini also observed water ice geysers erupting from the south pole of enceladus which gives more credibility to the idea that enceladus is supplying the particles of saturns e ring mission scientists began to suspect that there may be pockets of liquid water near the surface of the moon that fuel the eruptions.non march 12 2008 cassini made a close fly-by of enceladus passing within 50 km of the moons surface the spacecraft passed through the plumes extending from its southern geysers detecting water carbon dioxide and various hydrocarbons with its mass spectrometer while also mapping surface features that are at much higher temperature than their surroundings with the infrared spectrometer cassini was unable to collect data with its cosmic dust analyzer due to an unknown software malfunction.nnnon november 21 2009 cassini made its eighth flyby of enceladus this time with a different geometry approaching within 1,600 kilometers 990 mi of the surface the composite infrared spectrograph cirs instrument produced a map of thermal emissions from the baghdad sulcus tiger stripe the data returned helped create a detailed and high resolution mosaic image of the southern part of the moons saturn-facing hemisphere.non april 3 2014 nearly ten years after cassini entered saturns orbit nasa reported evidence of a large salty internal ocean of liquid water in enceladus the presence of an internal salty ocean in contact with the moons rocky core places enceladus among the most likely places in the solar system to host alien microbial life on june 30 2014 nasa celebrated ten years of cassini exploring saturn and its moons highlighting the discovery of water activity on enceladus among other findings.nin september 2015 nasa announced that gravitational and imaging data from cassini were used to analyze the librations of enceladus orbit and determined that the moons surface is not rigidly joined to its core concluding that the underground ocean must therefore be global in extent.non october 28 2015 cassini performed a close flyby of enceladus coming within 49 km 30 mi of the surface and passing through the icy plume above the south pole.nnradio occultations of saturns ringseditnin may 2005 cassini began a series of radio occultation experiments to measure the size-distribution of particles in saturns rings and measure the atmosphere of saturn itself for over four months the craft completed orbits designed for this purpose during these experiments it flew behind the ring plane of saturn as seen from earth and transmitted radio waves through the particles the radio signals received on earth were analyzed for frequency phase and power shift of the signal to determine the structure of the rings.nnn upper image visible color mosaic of saturns

forced it to temporarily enter safe mode all of the data from the flyby were recovered.nnmission extensioneditnon april 15 2008 cassini received funding for a 27-month extended mission it consisted of 60 more orbits of saturn with 21 more close titan flybys seven of enceladus six of mimas eight of tethys and one targeted flyby each of dione rhea and helene the extended mission began on july 1 2008 and was renamed the cassini equinox mission as the mission coincided with saturns equinox.nnsecond mission extensioneditna proposal was submitted to nasa for a second mission extension september 2010

massive great white spot storm that recurs roughly every 30 years on saturn data from the composite infrared spectrometer cirs instrument indicated a powerful discharge from the storm that caused a temperature spike in the stratosphere of saturn 83 k 83 c 149 f above normal simultaneously a huge increase in ethylene gas was detected by nasa researchers at goddard research center in greenbelt maryland ethylene is a colorless gas that is highly uncommon on saturn and is produced both naturally and through man-made sources on earth the storm that produced this discharge was first observed by the spacecraft on december 5 2010 in saturns northern hemisphere the storm is the first of its kind to be observed by a spacecraft in orbit around saturn as well as the first to be observed at thermal infrared wavelengths allowing scientists to observe the temperature of saturns atmosphere and track phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye the spike of ethylene gas that was produced by the storm reached levels that were 100 times more than those thought possible for saturn scientists have also determined that the storm witnessed was the largest hottest stratospheric vortex ever detected in the solar system initially being larger than jupiters great red spot.nnvenus transiteditnon december 21 2012 cassini observed a transit of venus across the sun the vims instrument analyzed sunlight

mostly blue color to more of a golden color one theory for this is a seasonal change extended exposure to sunlight may be creating haze as the pole swivels toward the sun it was previously noted that there was less blue color overall on saturn between 2004 and 2008.nn 2012 and 2016:hexagon color changesn 2013 and 2017:hexagon color changesnngrand finale and destructioneditnmain article cassini retirementncassinis end involved a series of close saturn passes approaching within the rings then an entry into saturns atmosphere on september 15 2017 to destroy the spacecraft this method was chosen because it is imperative to ensure protection and prevent biological contamination to any of the moons of saturn thought to offer potential habitability.nin 2008 a number of options were evaluated to achieve this goal each with varying funding scientific and technical challenges a short period saturn impact for an end of mission was rated excellent with the reasons d-ring option satisfies unachieved ao goals cheap and easily achievable while collision with an icy moon was rated good for being cheap and achievable anywhere/time".non november 29 2016 the spacecraft performed a titan flyby that took it to the gateway of f-ring orbits this was the start of the grand finale phase culminating in its impact with the planet a final titan flyby on april 22 2017 changed the orbit again to fly through the gap between saturn and its inner ring days later on april 26 cassini passed about 3,100 km 1,900 mi above saturns cloud layer and 320 km 200 mi from the visible edge of the inner ring it successfully took images of saturns atmosphere and began returning data the next day after a further 22 orbits through the gap the mission was ended with a dive into saturns atmosphere on september 15 signal was lost at 7:55:46 am edt on september 15 2017 just 30 seconds later than predicted it is estimated that the spacecraft burned up about 45 seconds after the last transmission.nin september 2018 nasa won an emmy award for outstanding original interactive program for its presentation of the cassini missions grand finale at saturn.nin january 2019 new research
