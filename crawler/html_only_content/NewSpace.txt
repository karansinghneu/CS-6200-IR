to a global sector of new aerospace companies and ventures working independently of governments and traditional major contractors to develop faster better and cheaper access to space and spaceflight technologies driven by commercial as distinct from political or other motivations to broader more socioeconomically-oriented ends.ninvestment bank morgan stanley expects 2019 to show key milestones and catalysts in the new space sector"nand advises its customers to pay attention to space companies".nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnthe space race which began in the mid-1950s and gave birth in earnest to spaceflight was famously a manifestation of the then larger politico-economic competition between capitalism represented by the united states and communism represented by the former soviet union for this reason from the very beginning the american business establishmentparticularly those bellwether private firms directly involved in the u.s space programhas championed the private development of space and space activity in 1961 writing as one of the deans of the american business establishment ralph j cordiner then chairman of general electric a blue-chip charter-prime contractor to nasa and the u.s space program contributed a chapter titled competitive private enterprise in space to the anthology peacetime uses of outer space while recognizing at the time the realities of having to initially rely on the u.s governments vast and convenient organization resources and power in order to effectively address the immediate soviet space challenge cordiner nonetheless advocated private sector dominanceultimatelyof space activity consistent with textbook american capitalist ideals.nnin fact syncom hughes aircraft companys pioneering commercial communications satellite system was originally conceived as a direct competitive response by american private industry to the soviets successful deployment of sputnik in 1957 the iconic cold war event that triggered the space race while syncom was eventually successfully deployed in 1963 dr harold rosen the hughes engineer responsible for developing championing and spearheading syncom also brother of ben rosen a pioneering silicon valley venture capitalist and entrepreneur and wall street technology analyst cited a general lack of confidence in the u.s governments early launch capabilities he later explained the syncom projects lengthy gestation period:this was not the most auspicious time late 1950s to propose a commercial space program...the most vivid impression most people then had of space-related activities was of rockets blowing up at cape canaveral.n1980s u.s commercial space policy and enabling legislationeditnnotwithstanding the free-enterprise sentiments and preferences of american industry space remained a firmly government-controlled and directed endeavor well after the capstone apollo moon landing in 1969 the term alt.space was first used in the early 1980s to describe companies that were at last beginning to take up cordiners mantle and make serious efforts to reach outer space without needing or relying on the cooperation of nasa or other governmental agencies or by extension even their major contractors efforts which were catalyzed by an historic shift in u.s policy favoring private space activity culminating in the landmark commercial space launch act of 1984 beyond the terminology"alt.space private space newspace or new space"since the 1980s the philosophy of various organizations such as the space frontier foundation in the united states has been one of extolling the virtues of solar system settlement and operating independent of bureaucratic government programs".nn1990s post-soviet u.s.-russian private space ventureseditnthe seeds of todays newspace were brought to fruition by the collapse of the former soviet union in 1991 and the releasing of that former rival-superpowers iconic state-owned and otherwise mature and proven space assets technologies capabilities and services onto the worlds private markets with the assistance of a handful of largely american private firms notably these core-four international launch services f/k/a

est 1999 until that moment in world industrial history no private business enterprise or entrepreneur could rightly conceive of for example leasingor possibly owning and operatingan orbiting space station such as mir or even just ordering a space launch in the ordinary course of business.nuntil then even for a telecommunications giant like at&t placing a commercial communications satellite in orbit for example was a fairly monumental undertaking contrast that with today when a 100 million space launch vehicle can now be specified built priced ordered and eventually even launched online through for example united launch alliances rocketbuilder website.nonce that industry-wide mental block was removedonce the ease relatively speaking and normalization of planning and conducting space activities began to dawn on private industrythe animal spirits of aerospace capitalism were roused entrepreneurial vision and imagination started to abound and newspace began to take shape in earnest this set off todays competitive industry-wide virtuous cycle of faster better cheaper a project and systems management philosophy pioneered in the space field by nasa and otherwise paved the way to todays generally far more vibrant and conducive space-business environmentwhether or not involving russian space resources at this pointwhere entrepreneurs investors regulators lawmakers supranational organizations non-governmental organizations ngos the media and other key ecosystem participants are now able to deal with privately conducted for-profit space activity more rationally practically and cost-efficiently than ever before wernher von braun summed up the historical institutional-bureaucratic cautiousness toward space activity in general by famously quipping we can lick gravity but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming."nnin his 2016 wall street journal review of julian guthries book how to make a spaceship a band of renegades an epic race and the birth of private spaceflight gregg easterbrook highlighted the seminal importance of these often overlooked post-soviet private space efforts in enabling and shaping todays newspace how to make a spaceship centers largely around the efforts of space entrepreneur peter diamandis and his ansari x prize won in 2004 by the spaceshipone team led by american aerospace engineer burt rutan and funded by microsoft co-founder and billionaire paul allen spaceshiptwo was then funded by british billionaire and industrialist sir richard branson and his virgin galactic to set the stage guthrie retraces the private space industrys development path however according to easterbrook:mr diamandis wasnt the sole entrepreneur to pursue private space flight early on ms guthrie covers other peculiar attempts neglected in ms guthries account is sea launch archetypal post-soviet boeing jv with russians and others the first private project to send heavy objects into orbit including in 2001 the big satellites rock and roll the

sea launch was indeed the first privately financed working launch system and infrastructure...".nnear the end of the 1990s favored by strong public policy and spurred on by the foundational success of these post-soviet u.s.-russian private space ventures there was a dramatic increase in companies engaging in this process leading to common usage of the phrase new space companies newspace most prominently entrepreneurial space and commercial space are now the most commonly used terms though alt.space was still seen occasionally as late as 2011.nn2000s silicon valley-style entrepreneurial space initiativeseditnthings changed further in the early 2000s as elon musk formed spacex with significantly more private capital while he articulated a strong and consistent vision of the colonization of space beginning with mars."nhowever one company in a worldwide milieu of government-driven spaceflight activities simply did not cement a movement this began to change with the increasingly public revelations and pronouncements of blue origin after 2014 even though the company was formed about the same time as spacex it had maintained a very low profile in its first decade-and-a-half of existence by 2016 both of these private companies with billion-us-dollar-plus backing by committed investors were successfully vertically landing and reusing space launch vehicles both companies are building large reusable orbital launch systems that will utilize currently-under-development rocket engines that are each at least four years along in development and are already in use or under development test on ground test stands all with a focus on radically lowering the price of carrying people and cargo to space.nbeginning on november 23 2015 blue origin successfully demonstrated the repeated reuse of a rocket for the first time ever by completing five suborbital vertical takeoff and landing vtol flights of the same new shepard rocket a feat for which blue origin was awarded the prestigious 2016 robert j collier trophy.nnon march 30 2017 spacex successfully relaunched a previously flown orbital-class rocket falcon 9 for the first time in history an achievement many compare in significance to that of the wright brothers first flight celebrated astrophysicist neil degrasse tyson described the underlying economic importance of spacexs otherwise technical milestone:any demonstration of rocket reusability is a good thing when we fly on a boeing 747 across great distances we dont throw it away and roll out a new one reusability is arguably the most fundamental feature of affordable expensive things.echoing degrasse tysons post-flight sentiments former nasa official and current engineering dean at the university of colorado boulder bobby braun compared the falcon 9 rocket to the first successful commercial airliner the boeing 707 which ushered in the jet age".nindustry verticalseditnwhile newspace is currently a primarily horizontal market phenomenon or force which cuts across or converges many traditional existing space-industry verticals i.e vertical marketsincluding spacecraft launch vehicles and services scientific research etc.the ultimate promise of newspace is that it can become a true general purpose technology or meta-technology uniquely enabling the creation of new emerging and even once-unimaginable verticals including:nnngovernmental environmenteditnregulatory schemeseditnin the united states newspace firms and activities are primarily regulated by the faas office of commercial space transportation generally referred to as faa/ast however given the intersection of potentially many and varied agency-interests at stake in any newspace venture e.g faa fcc noaa dod nasa fda doe doc etc and the sheer infancy of newspace as an industry it appears a comprehensive and userfriendly u.s regulatory scheme has yet to be developed and put into place to the general satisfaction of newspace players:right now there are significant gaps in the u.s governments regulatory authority and licensing process for newly emerging commercial space ventures i.e newspace firms and projects processes exist for some ventures but not for others in many cases its not clear what agency if any a commercial firm should go through to get approval the lack of clear rules authorities and process is needlessly driving up risk for these firms worse yet it may lead some of them to move to countries where there is greater regulatory clarity or less oversight nlaws and regulationseditnninternational treatieseditnnbusiness
