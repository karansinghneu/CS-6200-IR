space race wikipedia n redirected from space racen jump to navigationnjump to searchnthis article is about the cold war rivalry between the united states and soviet union for various space races see list of space races for other uses of the term see space race disambiguation.nnnthe soviet union achieved an early lead in the space race by launching the first artificial satellite sputnik 1 replica shown in 1957.the united states led during the moon race by landing neil armstrong pictured and buzz aldrin on the moon july 20 1969.astronaut thomas p stafford and cosmonaut aleksei leonov shake hands in space to ease cold war tensions.nthe space race refers to the 20th-century competition between two cold war rivals the soviet union ussr and the united states us for dominance in spaceflight capability it had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following world war ii aided by captured german missile technology and personnel from the aggregat program nthe technological superiority required for such dominance was seen as necessary for national security and symbolic of ideological superiority the space race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites uncrewed space probes of the moon venus and mars and human spaceflight in low earth orbit and to the moon.nthe space race began on august 2 1955 when the soviet union responded to the us announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the international geophysical year by declaring they would also launch a satellite in the near future the soviet union beat the us to the first successful launch with the october 4 1957 orbiting of sputnik 1 and later beat the us to have the first human in earth orbit yuri gagarin on april 12 1961 the race peaked with the july 20 1969 us landing of the first humans on the moon with apollo 11 the ussr attempted several crewed lunar missions but eventually canceled them and concentrated on earth orbital space stations.na period of dtente followed with the april 1972 agreement on a co-operative apollosoyuz test project resulting in the july 1975 rendezvous in earth orbit of a us astronaut crew with a soviet cosmonaut crew the end of the space race is harder to pinpoint than its beginning but it was over by the december 1991 dissolution of the soviet union after which spaceflight cooperation between the us and russia flourished.nthe space race has left a legacy of earth communications and weather satellites and continuing human space presence on the international space station it has also sparked increases in spending on education and research and development which led to beneficial spin-off technologies.nncontentsnnnearly rocket developmenteditngermany during world war iieditn wernher von braun 19121977 technical director of nazi germanys missile program became the united states lead rocket engineer during the 1950s and 1960snthe origins of the space race can be traced to germany beginning in the 1930s and continuing during world war ii when nazi germany researched and built operational ballistic missiles capable of sub-orbital spaceflight starting in the early 1930s during the last stages of the weimar republic german aerospace engineers experimented with liquid-fueled rockets with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances the head of the german armys ballistics and munitions branch lieutenant colonel karl emil becker gathered a small team of engineers that included walter dornberger and leo zanssen to figure out how to use rockets as long-range artillery in order to get around the treaty of versailles ban on research and development of long-range cannons wernher von braun a young engineering prodigy was recruited by becker and dornberger to join their secret army program at kummersdorf-west in 1932 von braun dreamed of conquering outer space with rockets and did not initially see the military value in missile technology.nduring the second world war general dornberger was the military head of the armys rocket program zanssen became the commandant of the peenemnde army rocket center and von braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program they led the team that built the aggregate-4 a-4 rocket which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943 by 1943 germany began mass-producing the a-4 as the vergeltungswaffe 2 vengeance weapon 2 or more commonly v2 a ballistic missile with a 320 kilometers 200 mi range carrying a 1,130 kilograms 2,490 lb warhead at 4,000 kilometers per hour 2,500 mph its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it and radar detection provided little warning germany used the weapon to bombard southern england and parts of allied-liberated western europe from 1944 until 1945 after the war the v-2 became the basis of early american and soviet rocket designs.nat wars end american british and soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture germanys rocket engineers along with the german rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based each of the allies captured a share of the available members of the german rocket team but the united states benefited the most with operation paperclip recruiting von braun and most of his engineering team who later helped develop the american missile and space exploration programs the united states also acquired a large number of complete v2 rockets.nnsoviet rocket developmenteditnfurther information soviet rocketryn chief designer sergei korolev left with the father of the soviet atomic bomb igor kurchatov and chief theoretician mstislav keldysh in 1956nthe german rocket center in peenemnde was located in the eastern part of germany which became the soviet zone of occupation on stalins orders the soviet union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems the soviet rocket engineers were led by sergei korolev he had been involved in space clubs and early soviet rocket design in the 1930s but was arrested in 1938 during joseph stalins great purge and imprisoned for six years in gulag after the war he became the ussrs chief rocket and spacecraft engineer essentially the soviet counterpart to von braun his identity was kept a state secret throughout the cold war and he was identified publicly only as the chief designer in the west his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966.nafter almost a year in the area around peenemnde soviet officials conducted operation osoaviakhim and later moved more than 170 of the top captured german rocket specialists to gorodomlya island on lake seliger about 240 kilometers 150 mi northwest of moscow they were not allowed to participate in final soviet missile design but were used as problem-solving consultants to the soviet engineers they helped in the following areas the creation of a soviet version of the a-4 work on organizational schemes research in improving the a-4 main engine development of a 100-ton engine assistance in the layout of plant production rooms and preparation of rocket assembly using german components with their help particularly helmut grttrups group korolev reverse-engineered the a-4 and built his own version of the rocket the r-1 in 1948 later he developed his own distinct designs though many of these designs were influenced by the grttrup groups g4-r10 design from 1949 the germans were eventually repatriated in 195153.nnamerican rocket developmenteditnthe american professor robert h goddard had worked on developing solid-fuel rockets since 1914 and demonstrated a light battlefield rocket to the us army signal corps only five days before the signing of the armistice that ended world war i he also started developing liquid-fueled rockets in 1921 yet he had not been taken seriously by the public.nvon braun and his team were sent to the united states armys white sands proving ground located in new mexico in 1945 they set about assembling the captured v2s and began a program of launching them and instructing american engineers in their operation these tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space and the first two-stage rocket the wac corporal-v2 combination in 1949 the german rocket team was moved from fort bliss to the armys new redstone arsenal located in huntsville alabama in 1950 from here von braun and his team developed the armys first operational medium-range ballistic missile the redstone rocket that in slightly modified versions launched both americas first satellite and the first piloted mercury space missions it became the basis for both the jupiter and saturn family of rockets.nncold war missile raceeditnmain article nuclear arms racennthe cold war would become the great engine the supreme catalyst that sent rockets and their cargoes far above earth and worlds away if tsiolkovsky oberth goddard and others were the fathers of rocketry the competition between capitalism and communism was its midwife.nwilliam e burrows this new ocean the other world series p 147nnnthe cold war 19471991 developed between two former allies the soviet union and the united states soon after the end of the second world war it involved a continuing state of political conflict military tension proxy wars and economic competition primarily between the soviet union and its satellite states often referred to as the eastern bloc and the powers of the western world particularly the united states the primary participants military forces never clashed directly but expressed this conflict through military coalitions strategic conventional force deployments extensive aid to states deemed vulnerable proxy wars espionage propaganda a nuclear arms race and economic and technological competitions such as the space race.nin simple terms the cold war could be viewed as an expression of the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism the united states faced a new uncertainty beginning in september 1949 when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb american intelligence agencies discovered that the soviet union had exploded its first atomic bomb with the consequence that the united states potentially could face a future nuclear war that for the first time might devastate its cities given this new danger the united states participated in an arms race with the soviet union that included development of the hydrogen bomb as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms capable of delivering nuclear weapons a new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the united states during the 1950s which devolved into paranoid mccarthyism with communism spreading in china korea and eastern europe americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive witch-hunts to expose communist spies part of the american reaction to the soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large air force under the control of the strategic air command sac sac employed intercontinental strategic bombers as well as medium-bombers based close to soviet airspace in western europe and in turkey that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads.nfor its part the soviet union harbored fears of invasion having suffered at least 27 million casualties during world war ii after being invaded by nazi germany in 1941 the soviet union was wary of its former ally the united states which until late 1949 was the sole possessor of atomic weapons the united states had used these weapons operationally during world war ii and it could use them again against the soviet union laying waste to its cities and military centers since the americans had a much larger air force than the soviet union and the united states maintained advance air bases near soviet territory in 1947 stalin ordered the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms in order to counter the perceived american threat.nn soviet r-7 icbm and its derivative launch vehicles for sputnik vostok voskhod and soyuznin 1953 korolev was given the go-ahead to develop the r-7 semyorka rocket which represented a major advance from the german design although some of its components notably boosters still resembled the german g-4 the new rocket incorporated staged design a completely new control system and a new fuel it was successfully tested on august 21 1957 and became the worlds first fully operational icbm the following month it was later used to launch the first satellite into space and derivatives launched all piloted soviet spacecraft.nthe united states had multiple rocket programs divided among the different branches of the american armed services which meant that each force developed its own icbm program the air force initiated icbm research in 1945 with the mx-774 however its funding was cancelled and only three partially successful launches were conducted in 1947 in 1950 von braun began testing the air force pgm-11 redstone rocket family at cape canaveral in 1951 the air force began a new icbm program called mx-1593 and by 1955 this program was receiving top-priority funding the mx-1593 program evolved to become the atlas-a with its maiden launch occurring june 11 1957 becoming the first successful american icbm its upgraded version the atlas-d rocket later served as a nuclear icbm and as the orbital launch vehicle for project mercury and the remote-controlled agena target vehicle used in project gemini.nwith the cold war as an engine for change in the ideological competition between the united states and the soviet union a coherent space policy began to take shape in the united states during the late 1950s korolev took inspiration from the competition as well achieving many firsts to counter the possibility that the united states might prevail.nnthe race beginseditnfurther information soviet space program and space policy of the united statesnfirst artificial satelliteeditnin 1955 with both the united states and the soviet union building ballistic missiles that could be utilized to launch objects into space the starting line was drawn for the space race in separate announcements four days apart both nations publicly announced that they would launch artificial earth satellites by 1957 or 1958 on july 29 1955 james c hagerty president dwight d eisenhowers press secretary announced that the united states intended to launch small earth circling satellites between july 1 1957 and december 31 1958 as part of their contribution to the international geophysical year igy four days later at the sixth congress of international astronautical federation in copenhagen scientist leonid i sedov spoke to international reporters at the soviet embassy and announced his countrys intention to launch a satellite as well in the near future on august 30 1955 korolev managed to get the soviet academy of sciences to create a commission whose purpose was to beat the americans into earth orbit this was the de facto start date for the space race the council of ministers of the soviet union began a policy of treating development of its space program as a classified state secret.ninitially president eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over 100 kilometers 62 mi might be construed as violating that nations sovereign airspace he was concerned that the soviet union would accuse the americans of an illegal overflight thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense eisenhower and his advisors believed that a nations airspace sovereignty did not extend into outer space acknowledged as the krmn line and he used the 195758 international geophysical year launches to establish this principle in international law eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a warmonger if he were to use military missiles as launchers therefore he selected the untried naval research laboratorys vanguard rocket which was a research-only booster this meant that von brauns team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their jupiter-c rocket because of its intended use as a future military vehicle on september 20 1956 von braun and his team did launch a jupiter-c that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of nose cone reentry technology.nkorolev received word about von brauns 1956 jupiter-c test but thinking it was a satellite mission that failed he expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit since his r-7 was substantially more powerful than any of the american boosters he made sure to take full advantage of this capability by designing object d as his primary satellite it was given the designation d to distinguish it from other r-7 payload designations a b v and g which were nuclear weapon payloads object d dwarfed the proposed american satellites by having a weight of 1,400 kilograms 3,100 lb of which 300 kilograms 660 lb would be composed of scientific instruments that would photograph the earth take readings on radiation levels and check on the planets magnetic field however things were not going along well with the design and manufacturing of the satellite so in february 1957 korolev sought and received permission from the council of ministers to create a prosteishy sputnik ps-1 or simple satellite the council also decreed that object d be postponed until april 1958 the new sputnik was a shiny sphere that would be a much lighter craft weighing 83.8 kilograms 185 lb and having a 58-centimeter 23 in diameter the satellite would not contain the complex instrumentation that object d had but had two radio transmitters operating on different short wave radio frequencies the ability to detect if a meteoroid were to penetrate its pressure hull and the ability to detect the density of the earths thermosphere.nnnkorolev was buoyed by the first successful launches of his r-7 rocket in august and september which paved the way for him to launch his sputnik word came that the americans were planning to announce a major breakthrough at an international geophysical year conference at the national academy of sciences in washington d.c with a paper entitled satellite over the planet on october 6 1957 korolev anticipated that von braun might launch a jupiter-c with a satellite payload on or around october 4 or 5 in conjunction with the paper he hastened the launch moving it to october 4 the launch vehicle for ps-1 was a modified r-7 vehicle 8k71ps number m1-ps without much of the test equipment and radio gear that was present in the previous launches it arrived at the soviet missile base tyura-tam in september and was prepared for its mission at launch site number one on friday october 4 1957 at exactly 10:28:34 pm moscow time the r-7 with the now named sputnik 1 satellite lifted off the launch pad and placed this artificial moon into an orbit a few minutes later this fellow traveler as the name is translated in english was a small beeping ball less than two feet in diameter and weighing less than 200 pounds but the celebrations were muted at the launch control center until the down-range far east tracking station at kamchatka received the first distinctive beep beep beep sounds from sputnik 1s radio transmitters indicating that it was on its way to completing its first orbit about 95 minutes after launch the satellite flew over its launch site and its radio signals were picked up by the engineers and military personnel at tyura-tam thats when korolev and his team celebrated the first successful artificial satellite placed into earth-orbit.nnus reactioneditnmain article sputnik crisisnthe soviet success raised a great deal of concern in the united states for example economist bernard baruch wrote in an open letter titled the lessons of defeat to the new york herald tribune while we devote our industrial and technological power to producing new model automobiles and more gadgets the soviet union is conquering space it is russia not the united states who has had the imagination to hitch its wagon to the stars and the skill to reach for the moon and all but grasp it america is worried it should be."neisenhower ordered project vanguard to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned the december 6 1957 project vanguard launch failure occurred at cape canaveral air force station in florida broadcast live in front of a us television audience it was a monumental failure exploding a few seconds after launch and it became an international joke the satellite appeared in newspapers under the names flopnik stayputnik kaputnik and dudnik in the united nations the soviet delegate offered the us representative aid under the soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations only in the wake of this very public failure did von brauns redstone team get the go-ahead to launch their jupiter-c rocket as soon as they could in britain the uss western cold war ally the reaction was mixed some celebrated the fact that the soviets had reached space first while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring.nn william hayward pickering james van allen and wernher von braun display a full-scale model of explorer 1 at a washington dc news conference after confirmation the satellite was in orbitnon january 31 1958 nearly four months after the launch of sputnik 1 von braun and the united states successfully launched its first satellite on a four-stage juno i rocket derived from the us armys redstone missile at cape canaveral the satellite explorer 1 was 30.66 pounds 13.91 kg in mass the payload of explorer 1 weighed 18.35 pounds 8.32 kg it carried a micrometeorite gauge and a geiger-mller tube it passed in and out of the earth-encompassing radiation belt with its 194-by-1,368-nautical-mile 360 by 2,534 km orbit therefore saturating the tubes capacity and proving what dr james van allen a space scientist at the university of iowa had theorized the belt named the van allen radiation belt is a doughnut-shaped zone of high-level radiation intensity around the earth above the magnetic equator van allen was also the man who designed and built the satellite instrumentation of explorer 1 the satellite measured three phenomena cosmic ray and radiation levels the temperature in the spacecraft and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorites the satellite had no memory for data storage therefore it had to transmit continuously in march 1958 a second satellite was sent into orbit with augmented cosmic ray instruments.non april 2 1958 president eisenhower reacted to the soviet space lead in launching the first satellite by recommending to the us congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities congress led by senate majority leader lyndon b johnson responded by passing the national aeronautics and space act which eisenhower signed into law on july 29 1958 this law turned the national advisory committee on aeronautics into the national aeronautics and space administration nasa it also created a civilian-military liaison committee chaired by the president responsible for coordinating the nations civilian and military space programs.non october 21 1959 eisenhower approved the transfer of the armys remaining space-related activities to nasa on july 1 1960 the redstone arsenal became nasas george c marshall space flight center with von braun as its first director development of the saturn rocket family which when mature gave the us parity with the soviets in terms of lifting capability was thus transferred to nasa.nnuncrewed lunar probeseditnin 1958 korolev upgraded the r-7 to be able to launch a 400-kilogram 880 lb payload to the moon three secret 1958 attempts to launch luna e-1-class impactor probes failed the fourth attempt luna 1 launched successfully on january 2 1959 but missed the moon the fifth attempt on june 18 also failed at launch the 390-kilogram 860 lb luna 2 successfully impacted the moon on september 14 1959 the 278.5-kilogram 614 lb luna 3 successfully flew by the moon and sent back pictures of its far side on october 6 1959.nthe us reacted to the luna program by embarking on the ranger program in 1959 managed by nasas jet propulsion laboratory the block i ranger 1 and ranger 2 suffered atlas-agena launch failures in august and november 1961.nthe 727-pound 330 kg block ii ranger 3 launched successfully on january 26 1962 but missed the moon the 730-pound 330 kg ranger 4 became the first us spacecraft to reach the moon but its solar panels and navigational system failed near the moon and it impacted the far side without returning any scientific data ranger 5 ran out of power and missed the moon by 725 kilometers 391 nmi on october 21 1962 the first successful ranger mission was the 806-pound 366 kg block iii ranger 7 which impacted on july 31 1964.nnfirst human in spaceeditn yuri gagarin the first person in space 1961nby 1959 american observers believed that the soviet union would be the first to get a human into space because of the time needed to prepare for mercurys first launch on april 12 1961 the ussr surprised the world again by launching yuri gagarin into a single orbit around the earth in a craft they called vostok 1 they dubbed gagarin the first cosmonaut roughly translated from russian and greek as sailor of the universe although he had the ability to take over manual control of his capsule in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space vostok 1 orbited the earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the soviet union with gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7,000 meters 23,000 ft and landing by parachute the fdration aronautique internationale international federation of aeronautics credited gagarin with the worlds first human space flight although their qualifying rules for aeronautical records at the time required pilots to take off and land with their craft for this reason the soviet union omitted from their fai submission the fact that gagarin did not land with his capsule when the fai filing for gherman titovs second vostok flight in august 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique the fai committee decided to investigate and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch orbiting and return rather than the manner of landing and revised their rules keeping gagarins and titovs records intact.ngagarin became a national hero of the soviet union and the eastern bloc and a worldwide celebrity moscow and other cities in the ussr held mass demonstrations the scale of which was second only to the world war ii victory parade of 1945 april 12 was declared cosmonautics day in the ussr and is celebrated today in russia as one of the official commemorative dates of russia in 2011 it was declared the international day of human space flight by the united nations.nnnthe radio communication between the launch control room and gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch:nnkorolev preliminary stage intermediate main lift off we wish you a good flight everything is all right."ngagarin poyekhali lets go!.nnngagarins informal poyekhali became a historical phrase in the eastern bloc used to refer to the beginning of the human space flight era.nnfirst american in spaceeditn alan shepard the first american in space 1961nthe us air force had been developing a program to launch the first man in space named man in space soonest this program studied several different types of one-man space vehicles settling on a ballistic re-entry capsule launched on a derivative atlas missile and selecting a group of nine candidate pilots after nasas creation the program was transferred over to the civilian agency and renamed project mercury on november 26 1958 nasa selected a new group of astronaut from the greek for star sailor candidates from navy air force and marine test pilots and narrowed this down to a group of seven for the program capsule design and astronaut training began immediately working toward preliminary suborbital flights on the redstone missile followed by orbital flights on the atlas each flight series would first start uncrewed then carry a non-human primate then finally humans.non may 5 1961 alan shepard became the first american in space launched in a ballistic trajectory on mercury-redstone 3 in a spacecraft he named freedom 7 though he did not achieve orbit like gagarin he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecrafts attitude and retro-rocket firing after his successful return shepard was celebrated as a national hero honored with parades in washington new york and los angeles and received the nasa distinguished service medal from president john f kennedy.nnkennedy

john f kennedys support for americas crewed space program was lukewarm jerome wiesner of mit who served as a science advisor to presidents eisenhower and kennedy and himself an opponent of crewed space exploration remarked if kennedy could have opted out of a big space program without hurting the country in his judgment he would have as late as march 1961 when nasa administrator james e webb submitted a budget request to fund a moon landing before 1970 kennedy rejected it because it was simply too expensive some were surprised by kennedys eventual support of nasa and the space program because of how often he had attacked the eisenhower administrations inefficiency during the election.ngagarins flight changed this now kennedy sensed the humiliation and fear on the part of the american public over the soviet lead additionally the bay of pigs invasion planned before his term began but executed during it was an embarrassment to his administration due to the colossal failure of the american forces looking for something to save political face he sent a memo dated april 20 1961 to vice president lyndon b johnson asking him to look into the state of americas space program and into programs that could offer nasa the opportunity to catch up the two major options at the time seemed to be either establishment of an earth orbital space station or a crewed landing on the moon johnson in turn consulted with von braun who answered kennedys questions based on his estimates of us and soviet rocket lifting capability based on this johnson responded to kennedy concluding that much more was needed to reach a position of leadership and recommending that the crewed moon landing was far enough in the future that the us had a fighting chance to achieve it first.nkennedy ultimately decided to pursue what became the apollo program and on may 25 took the opportunity to ask for congressional support in a cold war speech titled special message on urgent national needs

20 1962 his mercury-atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the friendship 7 spacecraft and splashed down safely in the atlantic ocean after a tense reentry due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat-shield as the first american in orbit glenn became a national hero and received a ticker-tape parade in new york city reminiscent of that given for charles lindbergh on february 23 1962 president kennedy escorted him in a parade at cape canaveral air force station where he awarded glenn with the nasa service medal.nthe united states launched three more mercury

developing project gemini.nnvostokeditn replica of the vostok capsulengherman titov became the first soviet cosmonaut to exercise manual control of his vostok 2 craft on august 6 1961 the soviet union demonstrated 24-hour launch pad turnaround and the capability to launch two piloted spacecraft vostok 3 and vostok 4 in essentially identical orbits on august 11 and 12 1962 the two spacecraft came within approximately 6.5 kilometers 4.0 mi of one another close enough for radio communication vostok 4 also set a record of nearly four days in space though the two crafts orbits were as nearly identical as possible given the accuracy of the launch rockets guidance system slight variations still existed which drew the two craft at first as close to each other as 6.5 kilometers 3.5 nautical miles then as far apart as 2,850 kilometers 1,540 nautical miles there were no maneuvering rockets on the vostok to permit space rendezvous required to keep two spacecraft a controlled distance apart.nn valentina tereshkovanthe soviet union duplicated its dual-launch feat with vostok 5 and vostok 6 june 16 1963 this time they launched the first woman also the first civilian valentina tereshkova into space on vostok 6 launching a woman was reportedly korolevs idea and it was accomplished purely for propaganda value tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists but tereshkova was the only one to fly the ussr didnt again open its cosmonaut corps to women until 1980 two years after the united states opened its astronaut corps to women.nthe soviets kept the details and true appearance of the vostok capsule secret until the april 1965 moscow economic exhibition where it was first displayed without its aerodynamic nose cone concealing the spherical capsule the vostok spaceship had been first displayed at the july 1961 tushino air show mounted on its launch vehicles third stage with the nose cone in place a tail section with eight fins was also added in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers this spurious tail section also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary.nnkennedy proposes a joint us-ussr programeditnon september 20 1963 in a speech before the united nations general assembly president kennedy proposed that the united states and the soviet union join forces in an effort to reach the

soviet premier nikita khrushchev initially rejected kennedys proposal however on october 2 1997 it was reported that khrushchevs son sergei claimed khrushchev was poised to accept kennedys proposal at the time of kennedys assassination on november 22 1963 during the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture and decided to accept kennedys offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the worlds two superpowers but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he did not have the same trust for kennedys successor lyndon johnson.nas president johnson steadfastly pursued the gemini and apollo programs promoting them as kennedys legacy to the american public one week after kennedys

announced project gemini a two-man spacecraft that would support the later three-man apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the moon and back and extra-vehicular activity to accomplish useful work outside the spacecraft.nmeanwhile korolev had planned further long-term missions for the vostok spacecraft and had four vostoks in various stages of fabrication in late 1963 at his okb-1 facilities at that time the americans announced their ambitious plans for the project gemini flight schedule these plans included major advancements in spacecraft capabilities including a two-person spacecraft the ability to change orbits the capacity to perform an extravehicular activity eva and the goal of docking with another spacecraft these represented major advances over the previous mercury or vostok capsules and korolev felt the need to try to beat the americans to many of these innovations korolev already had begun designing the vostoks replacement the next-generation soyuz spacecraft a multi-cosmonaut spacecraft that had at least the same capabilities as the gemini spacecraft soyuz would not be available for at least three years and it could not be called upon to deal with this new american challenge in 1964 or 1965 political pressure in early 1964which some

accomplish its first flight allowing the soviets to achieve another first launching voskhod 1 on october 12 1964 the first spacecraft with a three-cosmonaut crew the ussr touted another technological achievement during this mission it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt-sleeve-environment however flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the soviet spacecrafts environmental systems rather this innovation was accomplished because the crafts limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization this feat was not repeated until the us apollo command module flew in 1968 this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt-sleeve environment while in space.nbetween october 1416 1964 leonid brezhnev and a small cadre of high-ranking communist party officials

troublesome voskhod program cancelling voskhod 3 and 4 which were in the planning stages and started concentrating on the race to the moon voskhod 2 ended up being korolevs final achievement before his death on january 14 1966 as it became the last of the many space firsts that demonstrated the ussrs domination in spacecraft technology during the early 1960s according to historian asif siddiqi korolevs accomplishments marked the absolute zenith of the soviet space program one never ever attained since there was a two-year pause in soviet piloted space flights while voskhods replacement the soyuz spacecraft was designed and developed.non march 18 1965 about a week before the first american piloted project gemini space flight the ussr accelerated the competition by launching the two-cosmonaut voskhod 2 mission with pavel belyayev and alexey leonov voskhod 2s design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity eva also known as a spacewalk while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsules electronics would not overheat leonov performed the first-ever eva as part of the mission a fatality was narrowly avoided when leonovs spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space preventing him from re-entering the airlock in order to overcome this he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level he succeeded in safely re-entering the ship but he and belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecrafts atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45 pure oxygen which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re-entry the reentry involved two more challenges an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers 240 mi off its designated target area the

lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely resulting in the craft spinning wildly komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system which was only partially effective the flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day during the emergency re-entry a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute causing descent speed to reach as high as 40 m/s 140 km/h
