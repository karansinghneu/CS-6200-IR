moksha on the river thames in london shortly before completing the first human-powered circumnavigation of the earth 2007n in 2012 the swiss boat planetsolar became the first ever solar electric vehicle to circumnavigate the globe.ncircumnavigation is the complete navigation around an entire island continent or astronomical body e.g a planet or moon this article focuses on the circumnavigation of earth the first circumnavigation of earth was the magellan-elcano expedition which sailed from seville spain in 1519 and returned in 1522 after crossing the atlantic pacific and indian oceans.nncontentsnnnetymologyeditnthe word circumnavigation is a noun formed from the verb circumnavigate from the past participle of the latin verb circumnavigare from circum around navigare to sail see further navigation etymology.nndefinitioneditnif a person walks completely around either pole he crosses all meridians but this is not generally considered a circumnavigation the trajectory of a true global circumnavigation forms a continuous loop on the surface of earth separating two halves of comparable area a basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a great circle and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points antipodal to each other in practice people use different definitions of world circumnavigation to accommodate practical constraints depending on the method of travel since the planet is quasispheroidal a trip from one pole to the other and back again on the other side would technically be a circumnavigation but practical difficulties generally preclude such a voyage although it was successfully undertaken in the early 1980s by ranulph fiennes.nnhistoryeditnthe first single voyage of global circumnavigation was that of the ship victoria between 1519 and 1522 known as the magellanelcano expedition it was a castilian spanish voyage of discovery led initially by the portuguese ferdinand magellan between 1519 and 1521 and then by the spanish juan sebastin elcano from 1521 to 1522 the voyage started in seville crossed the atlantic ocean and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of south america where the expedition discovered the strait of magellan named after the fleets captain it then continued across the pacific discovering a number of islands on its way including guam before arriving in the philippines after magellans death in the philippines in 1521 elcano took command of the expedition and continued the journey across the indian ocean round the cape of good hope north along the atlantic ocean and back to spain in 1522 elcano and a small group of 18 men were actually the only members of the expedition to make the full circumnavigation.napart from some scholars it is not generally accepted that magellan and some crew members possibly some other portuguese and the malay-sumatrese enrique of malacca who survived to the philippines and borneo previously completed a full circumnavigation on several voyages since sumatra and malacca where magellan had been twice before in 1509 and in 1511-1512 lie southwest of cebu philippines if he had also been in the moluccas islands located southeast of cebu in early 1512 dubious and controversial he completed and clearly exceeded an entire circumnavigation of earth in longitudethough one circumnavigation in the strict sense implies a return to the same exact point however traveling west from europe in 1521 magellan reached a region of southeast asia in the malay archipelago which he had reached on previous voyages traveling east magellan thereby achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.nin 1577 elizabeth i sent francis drake to start an expedition against the spanish along the pacific coast of the americas drake set out from plymouth england in november 1577 aboard pelican which drake renamed golden hind mid-voyage in september 1578 he passed through the southern tip of south america named drake passage which connects the southwestern part of the atlantic ocean with the southeastern part of the pacific ocean in june 1579 drake landed somewhere north of spains northern-most claim in alta california which is known as drakes bay california drake completed the second circumnavigation of the world in september 1580 becoming the first commander to lead an entire circumnavigation.nfor the wealthy long voyages around the world such as was done by ulysses s grant became possible in the 19th century and the two world wars moved vast numbers of troops around the planet however it was later improvements in technology and rising incomes that made such trips relatively common.nnnauticaleditnthe nautical global and fastest circumnavigation record is currently held by a wind-powered vessel the trimaran idec 3 the record was established by six sailors francis joyon alex pella clment surtel gwnol gahinet sbastien audigane and bernard stamm who wrote themselves into history books on 26 january 2017 by circumnavigating the globe in 40 days 23 hours 30 minutes and 30 seconds the absolute speed sailing record around the world followed the north atlantic ocean equator south atlantic ocean southern ocean south atlantic ocean equator north atlantic ocean route in an easterly direction.nnwind powerededitn the route of a typical modern sailing circumnavigation via the suez canal and the panama canal is shown in red its antipodes are shown in yellow.nthe map on the right shows in red a typical non-competitive route for a sailing circumnavigation of the world by the trade winds and the suez and panama canals overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route it can be seen that the route roughly approximates a great circle and passes through two pairs of antipodal points this is a route followed by many cruising sailors going in the western direction the use of the trade winds makes it a relatively easy sail although it passes through a number of zones of calms or light winds.nn the route of a typical yacht racing circumnavigation is shown in red its antipodes are shown in yellow.nin yacht racing a round-the-world route approximating a great circle would be quite impractical particularly in a non-stop race where use of the panama and suez canals would be impossible yacht racing therefore defines a world circumnavigation to be a passage of at least 21,600 nautical miles 40,000 km in length which crosses the equator crosses every meridian and finishes in the same port as it starts the second map on the right shows the route of the vende globe round-the-world race in red overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route it can be seen that the route does not pass through any pairs of antipodal points since the winds in the higher southern latitudes predominantly blow west-to-east it can be seen that there are an easier route west-to-east and a harder route east-to-west when circumnavigating by sail this difficulty is magnified for square-rig vessels.nfor around the world sailing records there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600 nautical miles calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63s it is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track the equator must be crossed.nthe solo wind powered circumnavigation record of 42 days 16 hours 40 minutes and 35 seconds was established by franois gabart on the maxi-multihull sailing yacht macif and completed on 7 december 2017 the voyage followed the north atlantic ocean equator south atlantic ocean southern ocean south atlantic ocean equator north atlantic ocean route in an easterly direction.nnmechanically powerededitnsince the advent of world cruises in 1922 by cunards laconia thousands of people have completed circumnavigations of the globe at a more leisurely pace typically these voyages begin in new york city or southampton and proceed westward routes vary either travelling through the caribbean and then into the pacific ocean via the panama canal or around cape horn from there ships usually make their way to hawaii the islands of the south pacific australia new zealand then northward to hong kong south east asia and india at that point again routes may vary one way is through the suez canal and into the mediterranean the other is around cape of good hope and then up the west coast of africa these cruises end in the port where they began.nthe current mechanically powered circumnavigation record of 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes was established by a voyage of the wave-piercing trimaran earthrace which was completed on 27 june 2008 the voyage followed the north atlantic ocean panama canal pacific ocean indian ocean suez canal mediterranean sea route in a westerly direction.nnaviationeditnsince the development of commercial aviation at least tens of thousands of people have flown around the world some regular routes such as pan american flight one and later united airlines flight one circled the globe and today planning such a trip through connections is simple.nthe first successful attempt to circumnavigate the planet by air occurred in 1924 flown by aviators of the u.s army air service in a quartet of douglas world cruiser biplanes.nthe first lighter-than-air aircraft of any type to circumnavigate under its own power was the rigid airship lz 127 graf zeppelin which did so in 1929.naviation records take account of the wind circulation patterns of the world in particular the jet streams which circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres without crossing the equator there is therefore no requirement to cross the equator or to pass through two antipodal points in the course of setting a round-the-world aviation record thus for example steve fossetts global circumnavigation by balloon was entirely contained within the southern hemisphere.nfor powered aviation the course of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians the course must be at least 36,770 kilometres 19,850 nmi long which is approximately the length of the tropic of cancer the course must include set control points at latitudes outside the arctic and antarctic circles.nin ballooning which is totally at the mercy of the winds the requirements are even more relaxed the course must cross all meridians and must include a set of checkpoints which are all outside of two circles chosen by the pilot having radii of 3,335.85 kilometres 2,072.80 mi and enclosing the poles though not necessarily centred on them.nnastronauticseditnthe first person to fly in space yuri gagarin also became the first person to complete an orbital spaceflight in the vostok 1 spaceship within 2 hours in 1961.nnhuman-powerededitnaccording to adjudicating bodies guinness world records and explorersweb jason lewis completed the first human-powered circumnavigation of the globe on 6 october 2007 this was part of a thirteen-year journey entitled expedition 360.nin 2012 turkish-born american adventurer erden eru completed the first entirely solo human-powered circumnavigation travelling by rowboat sea kayak foot and bicycle from 10 july 2007 to 21 july 2012 crossing the equator twice passing over 12 antipodal points and logging 66,299 kilometres 41,196 mi in 1,026 days of travel time excluding breaks.nnational geographic lists colin angus as being the first to complete a global circumnavigation however his journey did not cross the equator or hit the minimum of two antipodal points as stipulated by the rules of guinness world records and adventurestats by explorersweb.npeople have both bicycled and run around the world but the oceans have had to be covered by air or sea travel making the distance shorter than the guinness guidelines to go from north america to asia on foot is theoretically possible but very difficult it involves crossing the bering strait on the ice and around 3,000 kilometres 1,900 mi of roadless swamped or freezing cold areas in alaska and eastern russia no one has so far travelled all of this route by foot david kunst was the first verified person to walk around the world between 20 june 1970 and 10 october 1974.nnsee also around the world cycling recordnnotable circumnavigationseditnmain article list of circumnavigationsnn a replica of
