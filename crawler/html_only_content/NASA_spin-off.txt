nasa spinoff technologies wikipedia n redirected from nasa spin-offn jump to navigationnjump to searchnspinoff technologies originating with the us space agencynnasa spinoff technologies are commercial products and services which have been developed with the help of nasa through research and development contracts such as small business innovation research sbir or sttr awards licensing of nasa patents use of nasa facilities technical assistance from nasa personnel or data from nasa research information on new nasa technology that may be useful to industry is available in periodical and website form in nasa tech briefs while successful examples of commercialization are reported annually in the nasa publication spinoffs".nin 1979 notable science fiction author robert a heinlein helped bring awareness to the spinoffs when he was asked to appear before congress after recovering from one of the earliest known vascular bypass operations to correct a blocked artery in his testimony reprinted in the book expanded universe he claimed that four nasa spinoff technologies made the surgery possible and it was a few from a long list of nasa spinoff technologies from space development.nfor more than 50 years the nasa technology transfer program has connected nasa resources to private industry referring to the commercial products as spinoffs well-known products that nasa claims as spinoffs include memory foam originally named temper foam freeze-dried food firefighting equipment emergency space blankets dustbusters cochlear implants lzr racer swimsuits and cmos image sensors as of 2016 nasa claims that there are nearly 2,000 other spinoffs in the fields of computer technology environment and agriculture health and medicine public safety transportation recreation

some examples of everyday products claimed to be spinoffs.nncontentsnnnhistory of the spinoff publicationeditnspinoff is a nasa publication featuring technology made available to the public since 1976 nasa has featured an average of 50 technologies each year in the annual publication and spinoff maintains a searchable database of these technologies when products first spun off from space research nasa presented a black and white report in 1973 titled the technology utilization program report because of interest in the reports nasa decided to create the annual publications in color spinoff was first published in 1976 and since then nasa has distributed free copies to universities the media inventors and the general public spinoff describes how nasa works with various industries and small businesses to bring new technology to the public as of 2016 there were over 1,920 spinoff products in the database dating back to 1976.nnhealth and medicineeditninfrared ear thermometerseditndiatek

center used the fuel to produce a flare that can safely destroy landmines the fuel that is left unused from a launch will become a solid which cannot be reused but can be used as an ingredient needed to create the demining device flare the demining device flare uses a battery-triggered electric match to ignite and neutralize land mines in the field without detonation the flare uses the solid rocket fuel to burn a hole in a mines case and burns away the explosive contents so the mine can be disarmed without hazard.nnfire-resistant reinforcementeditnbuilt and designed by avco corporation the apollo heat shield was coated with a material whose purpose was to burn and thus dissipate energy during reentry while charring to form a protective coating to block heat penetration nasa subsequently funded avcos development of other applications of the heat shield such as fire-retardant paints and foams for aircraft which led to an intumescent epoxy material which expands in volume when exposed to heat or flames acting as an insulating barrier and dissipating heat through burn-off further innovations include steel coatings devised to make high-rise buildings and public structures safer by swelling to provide a tough and stable insulating layer over the steel for up to 4 hours of fire protection ultimately to slow building collapse and provide more time for escape.nnfirefighting equipmenteditnfirefighting equipment in the united states is based on lightweight materials developed for the u.s space program nasa and the national bureau of standards created

apollo missions nasa conducted extensive research into space food one of the techniques developed in 1938 by nestl was freeze drying in the united states action products later commercialized this technique for other foods concentrating on snack food resulting in products like space ice cream the foods are cooked quickly frozen and then slowly heated in a vacuum chamber to remove the ice crystals formed by the freezing process the final product retains 98 of its nutrition and weighs much less than before drying the ratio of weight before and after drying depends strongly on the particular food item but a typical freeze-dried weight is 20 of the original weight.ntoday one of the benefits of this advancement in food preservation includes simple nutritious meals available to

under weightless conditions while planning for human spaceflight nasa enlisted the aid of the pillsbury company to address two principal concerns eliminating crumbs of food that might contaminate the spacecrafts atmosphere and sensitive instruments and assuring absolute absence of disease-producing bacteria and toxins pillsbury developed the hazard analysis and critical control point haccp concept to address nasas second concern haccp is designed to prevent food safety problems rather than to catch them after they have occurred the u.s food and drug administration has applied haccp guidelines for the handling of seafood juice and dairy products.nfor space missions gold is particularly useful because it is good at reflecting light which will help to detect celestial objects from far away and gold does not oxidize so it will not tarnish unlike most other metals due to both benefits the james webb space telescope uses a lot of gold for its mirrors nasa partnered with epner technology a brooklyn-based business that has been gold-plating for generations to develop the technology to gold plate the telescopes parts this nasa technology transfer to epner gave the company a reputation for durable gold coatings and the academy of motion picture arts and sciences was having to replate oscar statues that had faded over time epner has contracted with the academy to gold plate all future oscars while offering a lifetime guarantee to replate for free any faded oscar its gold plating has lasted for decades in space without fading.nnmistakenly attributed nasa spinoffseditnthe following
