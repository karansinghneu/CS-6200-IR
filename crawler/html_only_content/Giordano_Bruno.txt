bruno giordano.nnnnngiordano bruno drdno bruno italian dordano bruno latin iordanus brunus nolanus born filippo bruno 1548 17 february 1600 was an italian dominican friar philosopher mathematician poet and cosmological theorist he is known for his cosmological theories which conceptually extended the then-novel copernican model he proposed that the stars were distant suns surrounded by their own planets and he raised the possibility that these planets might foster life of their own a philosophical position known as cosmic pluralism he also insisted that the universe is infinite and could have no center".nstarting in 1593 bruno was tried for heresy by the roman inquisition on charges of denial of several core catholic doctrines including eternal damnation the trinity the divinity of christ the virginity of mary and transubstantiation brunos pantheism was also a matter of grave concern as was his teaching of the transmigration of the soul the inquisition found him guilty and he was burned at the stake in romes campo de fiori in 1600 after his death he gained considerable fame being particularly celebrated by 19th and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as a martyr for science although historians have debated the extent to which his heresy trial was a response to his astronomical views or to other aspects of his philosophy and theology.nbrunos case is still considered a landmark in the history of free thought and the emerging sciences.nin addition to cosmology bruno also wrote extensively on the art of memory a loosely organized group of mnemonic techniques and principles historian frances yates argues that bruno was deeply influenced by arab astrology particularly the philosophy of averroes neoplatonism renaissance hermeticism and genesis-like legends surrounding the egyptian god thoth other studies of bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.nncontentsnnnlifeeditnearly years 15481576editnborn filippo bruno in nola in campania then part of the kingdom of sicily known as the kingdom of naples in 1548 he was the son of giovanni bruno a soldier and fraulissa savolino in his youth he was sent to naples to be educated he was tutored privately at the augustinian monastery there and attended public lectures at the studium generale at the age of 17 he entered the dominican order at the monastery of san domenico maggiore in naples taking the name giordano after giordano crispo his metaphysics tutor he continued his studies there completing his novitiate and became an ordained priest in 1572 at age 24 during his time in naples he became known for his skill with the art of memory and on one occasion traveled to rome to demonstrate his mnemonic system before pope pius v and cardinal rebiba in his later years bruno claimed that the pope accepted his dedication to him of the lost work on the ark of noah at this time.nwhile bruno was distinguished for outstanding ability his taste for free thinking and forbidden books soon caused him difficulties given the controversy he caused in later life it is surprising that he was able to remain within the monastic system for eleven years in his testimony to venetian inquisitors during his trial many years later he says that proceedings were twice taken against him for having cast away images of the saints retaining only a crucifix and for having recommended controversial texts to a novice such behavior could perhaps be overlooked but brunos situation became much more serious when he was reported to have defended the arian heresy and when a copy of the banned writings of erasmus annotated by him was discovered hidden in the convent privy when he learned that an indictment was being prepared against him in naples he fled shedding his religious habit at least for a time.nnfirst years of wandering 15761583editnbruno first went to the genoese port of noli then to savona turin and finally to venice where he published his lost work on the signs of the times with the permission so he claimed at his trial of the dominican remigio nannini fiorentino from venice he went to padua where he met fellow dominicans who convinced him to wear his religious habit again from padua he went to bergamo and then across the alps to chambry and lyon his movements after this time are obscure.nn the earliest depiction of bruno is an engraving published in 1715 in germany presumed based on a lost contemporary portrait.nin 1579 he arrived in geneva as d.w singer a bruno biographer notes the question has sometimes been raised as to whether bruno became a protestant but it is intrinsically most unlikely that he accepted membership in calvins communion during his venetian trial he told inquisitors that while in geneva he told the marchese de vico of naples who was notable for helping italian refugees in geneva i did not intend to adopt the religion of the city i desired to stay there only that i might live at liberty and in security bruno had a pair of breeches made for himself and the marchese and others apparently made bruno a gift of a sword hat cape and other necessities for dressing himself in such clothing bruno could no longer be recognized as a priest things apparently went well for bruno for a time as he entered his name in the rectors book of the university of geneva in may 1579 but in keeping with his personality he could not long remain silent in august he published an attack on the work of antoine de la faye a distinguished professor he and the printer were promptly arrested rather than apologizing bruno insisted on continuing to defend his publication he was refused the right to take sacrament though this right was eventually restored he left geneva.nnhe went to france arriving first in lyon and thereafter settling for a time 15801581 in toulouse where he took his doctorate in theology and was elected by students to lecture in philosophy it seems he also attempted at this time to return to catholicism but was denied absolution by the jesuit priest he approached when religious strife broke out in the summer of 1581 he moved to paris there he held a cycle of thirty lectures on theological topics and also began to gain fame for his prodigious memory brunos feats of memory were based at least in part on his elaborate system of mnemonics but some of his contemporaries found it easier to attribute them to magical powers his talents attracted the benevolent attention of the king henry iii the king summoned him to the court bruno subsequently reported i got me such a name that king henry iii summoned me one day to discover from me if the memory which i possessed was natural or acquired by magic art i satisfied him that it did not come from sorcery but from organised knowledge and following this i got a book on memory printed entitled the shadows of ideas which i dedicated to his majesty forthwith he gave me an extraordinary lectureship with a salary."nin paris bruno enjoyed the protection of his powerful french patrons during this period he published several works on mnemonics including de umbris idearum on the shadows of ideas 1582 ars memoriae the art of memory 1582 and cantus circaeus circes song 1582 all of these were based on his mnemonic models of organised knowledge and experience as opposed to the simplistic logic-based mnemonic techniques of petrus ramus then becoming popular bruno also published a comedy summarizing some of his philosophical positions titled il candelaio the torchbearer 1582 in the 16th century dedications were as a rule approved beforehand and hence were a way of placing a work under the protection of an individual given that bruno dedicated various works to the likes of king henry iii sir philip sidney michel de castelnau french ambassador to england and possibly pope pius v it is apparent that this wanderer had risen sharply in status and moved in powerful circles.nnengland 15831585editn woodcut illustration of one of giordano brunos less complex mnemonic devicesnin april 1583 bruno went to england with letters of recommendation from henry iii as a guest of the french ambassador michel de castelnau there he became acquainted with the poet philip sidney to whom he dedicated two books and other members of the hermetic circle around john dee though there is no evidence that bruno ever met dee himself he also lectured at oxford and unsuccessfully sought a teaching position there his views were controversial notably with john underhill rector of lincoln college and subsequently bishop of oxford and george abbot who later became archbishop of canterbury abbot mocked bruno for supporting the opinion of copernicus that the earth sic did go round and the heavens did stand still whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round and his brains did not stand still and reports accusations that bruno plagiarized ficinos work.nnevertheless his stay in england was fruitful during that time bruno completed and published some of his most important works the six italian dialogues including the cosmological tracts la cena de le ceneri the ash wednesday supper 1584 de la causa principio et uno on cause principle and unity 1584 de linfinito universo e mondi on the infinite universe and worlds 1584 as well as lo spaccio de la bestia trionfante the expulsion of the triumphant beast 1584 and de gl heroici furori on the heroic frenzies 1585 some of these were printed by john charlewood some of the works that bruno published in london notably the ash wednesday supper appear to have given offense once again brunos controversial views and tactless language lost him the support of his friends john bossy has advanced the theory that while staying in the french embassy in london bruno was also spying on catholic conspirators under the pseudonym henry fagot for sir francis walsingham queen elizabeths secretary of state.nbruno is sometimes cited as being the first to propose that the universe is infinite which he did during his time in england but an english scientist thomas digges put forth this idea in a published work in 1576 some eight years earlier than bruno.nnlast years of wandering 15851592editnin october 1585 after the french embassy in london was attacked by a mob bruno returned to paris with castelnau finding a tense political situation moreover his 120 theses against aristotelian natural science and his pamphlets against the mathematician fabrizio mordente soon put him in ill favor in 1586 following a violent quarrel about mordentes invention the differential compass he left france for germany.nn woodcut from articuli centum et sexaginta adversus huius tempestatis mathematicos atque philosophos prague 1588in germany he failed to obtain a teaching position at marburg but was granted permission to teach at wittenberg where he lectured on aristotle for two years however with a change of intellectual climate there he was no longer welcome and went in 1588 to prague where he obtained 300 taler from rudolf ii but no teaching position he went on to serve briefly as a professor in helmstedt but had to flee again when he was excommunicated by the lutherans.nduring this period he produced several latin works dictated to his friend and secretary girolamo besler including de magia on magic theses de magia theses on magic and de vinculis in genere a general account of bonding all these were apparently transcribed or recorded by besler or bisler between 1589 and 1590 he also published de imaginum signorum et idearum compositione on the composition of images signs and ideas 1591.nin 1591 he was in frankfurt apparently during the frankfurt book fair he received an invitation to venice from the patrician giovanni mocenigo who wished to be instructed in the art of memory and also heard of a vacant chair in mathematics at the university of padua at the time the inquisition seemed to be losing some of its strictness and because venice was the most liberal state in italy bruno was lulled into making the fatal mistake of returning to italy.nhe went first to padua where he taught briefly and applied unsuccessfully for the chair of mathematics which was given instead to galileo galilei one year later bruno accepted mocenigos invitation and moved to venice in march 1592 for about two months he served as an in-house tutor to mocenigo when bruno announced his plan to leave venice to his host the latter who was unhappy with the teachings he had received and had apparently come to dislike bruno denounced him to the venetian inquisition which had bruno arrested on 22 may 1592 among the numerous charges of blasphemy and heresy brought against him in venice based on mocenigos denunciation was his belief in the plurality of worlds as well as accusations of personal misconduct bruno defended himself skillfully stressing the philosophical character of some of his positions denying others and admitting that he had had doubts on some matters of dogma the roman inquisition however asked for his transfer to rome after several months of argument the venetian authorities reluctantly consented and bruno was sent to rome in february 1593.nnimprisonment trial and execution 15931600editnduring the seven years of his trial in rome bruno was held in confinement lastly in the tower of nona some important documents about the trial are lost but others have been preserved among them a summary of the proceedings that was rediscovered in 1940 the numerous charges against bruno based on some of his books as well as on witness accounts included blasphemy immoral conduct and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology and involved some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology luigi firpo speculates the charges made against bruno by the roman inquisition were:nnn the trial of giordano bruno by the roman inquisition bronze relief by ettore ferrari campo de fiori rome.nbruno defended himself as he had in venice insisting that he accepted the churchs dogmatic teachings but trying to preserve the basis of his philosophy in particular he held firm to his belief in the plurality of worlds although he was admonished to abandon it his trial was overseen by the inquisitor cardinal bellarmine who demanded a full recantation which bruno eventually refused on 20 january 1600 pope clement viii declared bruno a heretic and the inquisition issued a sentence of death according to the correspondence of gaspar schopp of breslau he is said to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have replied maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiam perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than i receive it".nhe was turned over to the secular authorities on ash wednesday 17 february 1600 in the campo de fiori a central roman market square with his tongue imprisoned because of his wicked words he was hung upside down naked before he was finally burned at the stake his ashes were thrown into the tiber river all of brunos works were placed on the index librorum prohibitorum in 1603.nthe inquisition cardinals who judged giordano bruno were cardinal bellarmino bellarmine cardinal madruzzo madruzzi cardinal camillo borghese later pope paul v domenico cardinal pinelli pompeio cardinal arrigoni cardinal sfondrati pedro cardinal de deza manuel and cardinal santorio archbishop of santa severina cardinal-bishop of palestrina.nnphysical appearanceeditnthe earliest likeness of bruno is an engraving published in 1715 and cited by salvestrini as the only known portrait of bruno salvestrini suggests that it is a re-engraving made from a now lost original this engraving has provided the source for later images.nthe records of brunos imprisonment by the venetian inquisition in may 1592 describe him as a man of average height with a hazel-coloured beard and the appearance of being about forty years of age".nalternately a passage in a work by george abbot indicates that bruno was of diminutive stature when that italian didapper who intituled himselfe philotheus iordanus brunus nolanus magis elaboratae theologiae doctor c with a name longer than his body the word didapper used by abbot is the derisive term which at the time meant a small diving waterfowl".nncosmologyeditncontemporary cosmological beliefseditnsee also celestial spheres historyn illuminated illustration of the ptolemaic geocentric conception of the universe the outermost text reads the heavenly empire dwelling of god and all the selected"nin the first half of the 15th century nicholas of cusa challenged the then widely accepted philosophies of aristotelianism envisioning instead an infinite universe whose center was everywhere and circumference nowhere and moreover teeming with countless stars he also predicted that neither were the rotational orbits circular nor were their movements uniform.nin the second half of the 16th century the theories of copernicus 14731543 began diffusing through europe copernicus conserved the idea of planets fixed to solid spheres but considered the apparent motion of the stars to be an illusion caused by the rotation of the earth on its axis he also preserved the notion of an immobile center but it was the sun rather than the earth copernicus also argued the earth was a planet orbiting the sun once every year however he maintained the ptolemaic hypothesis that the orbits of the planets were composed of perfect circlesdeferents and epicyclesand that the stars were fixed on a stationary outer sphere.ndespite the widespread publication of copernicus work de revolutionibus orbium coelestium during brunos time most educated catholics subscribed to the aristotelian geocentric view that the earth was the center of the universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around it the ultimate limit of the universe was the primum mobile whose diurnal rotation was conferred upon it by a transcendental god not part of the universe although as the kingdom of heaven adjacent to it a motionless prime mover and first cause the fixed stars were part of this celestial sphere all at the same fixed distance from the immobile earth at the center of the sphere ptolemy had numbered these at 1,022 grouped into 48 constellations the planets were each fixed to a transparent sphere.nfew astronomers of brunos time accepted copernicuss heliocentric model among those who did were the germans michael maestlin 15501631 christoph rothmann johannes kepler 15711630 the englishman thomas digges author of a perfit description of the caelestial orbes and the italian galileo galilei 15641642.nnbrunos cosmological claimseditnin 1584 bruno published two important philosophical dialogues la cena de le ceneri and de linfinito universo et mondi in which he argued against the planetary spheres christoph rothmann did the same in 1586 as did tycho brahe in 1587 and affirmed the copernican principle.nin particular to support the copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of the earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds clouds etc in la cena de le ceneri bruno anticipates some of the arguments of galilei on the relativity principle note that he also uses the example now known as galileos ship.nntheophilus air through which the clouds and winds move are parts of the earth to mean under the name of earth the whole machinery and the entire animated part which consists of dissimilar parts so that the rivers the rocks the seas the whole vaporous and turbulent air which is enclosed within the highest mountains should belong to the earth as its members just as the air does in the lungs and in other cavities of animals by which they breathe widen their arteries and other similar effects necessary for life are performed the clouds too move through accidents in the body of the earth and are in its bowels as are the waters nwith the earth move all things that are on the earth if therefore from a point outside the earth something were thrown upon the earth it would lose because of the latters motion its straightness as would be seen on the ship moving along a river if someone on point c of the riverbank were to throw a stone along a straight line and would see the stone miss its target by the amount of the velocity of the ships motion but if someone were placed high on the mast of that ship move as it may however fast he would not miss his target at all so that the stone or some other heavy thing thrown downward would not come along a straight line from the point e which is at the top of the mast or cage to the point d which is at the bottom of the mast or at some point in the bowels and body of the ship thus if from the point d to the point e someone who is inside the ship would throw a stone straight up it would return to the bottom along the same line however far the ship moved provided it was not subject to any pitch and roll."nbrunos infinite universe was filled with a substancea pure air aether or spiritusthat offered no resistance to the heavenly bodies which in brunos view rather than being fixed moved under their own impetus momentum most dramatically he completely abandoned the idea of a hierarchical universe.nnthe universe is then one infinite immobile it is not capable of comprehension and therefore is endless and limitless and to that extent infinite and indeterminable and consequently immobile.nbrunos cosmology distinguishes between suns which produce their own light and heat and have other bodies moving around them and earths which move around suns and receive light and heat from them bruno suggested that some if not all of the objects classically known as fixed stars are in fact suns according to astrophysicist steven soter he was the first person to grasp that stars are other suns with their own planets."nbruno wrote that other worlds have no less virtue nor a nature different from that of our earth and like earth contain animals and inhabitants".nduring the late 16th century and throughout the 17th century brunos ideas were held up for ridicule debate or inspiration margaret cavendish for example wrote an entire series of poems against atoms and infinite worlds in poems and fancies in 1664 brunos true if partial vindication would have to wait for the implications and impact of newtonian cosmology.nbrunos overall contribution to the birth of modern science is still controversial some scholars follow frances yates stressing the importance of brunos ideas about the universe being infinite and lacking geocentric structure as a crucial crosspoint between the old and the new others see in brunos idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine indivisible one a forerunner of everetts many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.nwhile most academics note brunos theological position as pantheism physicist and philosopher max bernhard weinstein in his welt und lebensanschauungen hervorgegangen aus religion philosophie und naturerkenntnis world and life views emerging from religion philosophy and nature wrote that the theological model of pandeism was strongly expressed in the teachings of bruno especially with respect to the vision of a deity which had no particular relation to one part of the infinite universe more than any other and was immanent as present on earth as in the heavens subsuming in itself the multiplicity of existence.nnretrospective views of brunoeditn the monument to bruno in the place he was executed campo de fiori in rome monument to giordano bruno at potsdamer platz in berlin germany referencing his burning at the stake while tied upside down.nlate vatican positioneditnthe vatican has published few official statements about brunos trial and execution in 1942 cardinal giovanni mercati who discovered a number of lost documents relating to brunos trial stated that the church was perfectly justified in condemning him on the 400th anniversary of brunos death in 2000 cardinal angelo sodano declared brunos death to be a sad episode but despite his regret he defended brunos prosecutors maintaining that the inquisitors had the desire to serve freedom and promote the common good and did everything possible to save his life in the same year pope john paul ii made a general apology for the use of violence that some have committed in the service of truth".nna martyr of scienceeditnsome authors have characterized bruno as a martyr of science suggesting parallels with the galileo affair which began around 1610 they assert that even though brunos theological beliefs or perceptions of them by others were an important factor in his heresy trial his copernicanism and cosmological beliefs played a significant role in the outcome.n"it should not be supposed writes a m paterson of bruno and his heliocentric solar system that he reached his conclusions via some mystical revelation....his work is an essential part of the scientific and philosophical developments that he initiated paterson echoes hegel in writing that bruno ushers in a modern theory of knowledge that understands all natural things in the universe to be known by the human mind through the minds dialectical structure".ningegno writes that bruno embraced the philosophy of lucretius aimed at liberating man from the fear of death and the gods characters in brunos cause principle and unity desire to improve speculative science and knowledge of natural things and to achieve a philosophy which brings about the perfection of the human intellect most easily and eminently and most closely corresponds to the truth of nature."nother scholars oppose such views and claim brunos martyrdom to science to be exaggerated or outright false for yates while nineteenth century liberals were thrown into ecstasies over brunos copernicanism bruno pushes copernicus scientific work back into a prescientific stage back into hermetism interpreting the copernican diagram as a hieroglyph of divine mysteries."naccording to historian mordechai feingold both admirers and critics of giordano bruno basically agree that he was pompous and arrogant highly valuing his opinions and showing little patience with anyone who even mildly disagreed with him discussing brunos experience of rejection when he visited oxford university feingold suggests that it might have been brunos manner his language and his self-assertiveness rather than his ideas that caused offence.nntheological heresyeditnin his lectures on the history of philosophy hegel writes that brunos life represented a bold rejection of all catholic beliefs resting on mere authority."nalfonso ingegno states that brunos philosophy challenges the developments of the reformation calls into question the truth-value of the whole of christianity and claims that christ perpetrated a deceit on mankind bruno suggests that we can now recognize the universal law which controls the perpetual becoming of all things in an infinite universe a m paterson says that while we no longer have a copy of the official papal condemnation of bruno his heresies included the doctrine of the infinite universe and the innumerable worlds and his beliefs on the movement of the earth".nmichael white notes that the inquisition may have pursued bruno early in his life on the basis of his opposition to aristotle interest in arianism reading of erasmus and possession of banned texts white considers that brunos later heresy was multifaceted and may have rested on his conception of infinite worlds this was perhaps the most dangerous notion of all if other worlds existed with intelligent beings living there did they too have their visitations the idea was quite unthinkable."nfrances yates rejects what she describes as the legend that bruno was prosecuted as a philosophical thinker was burned for his daring views on innumerable worlds or on the movement of the earth yates however writes that the church was perfectly within its rights if it included philosophical points in its condemnation of brunos heresies because the philosophical points were quite inseparable from the heresies."naccording to the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy in 1600 there was no official catholic position on the copernican system and it was certainly not a heresy when bruno was burned at the stake as a heretic it had nothing to do with his writings in support of copernican cosmology."nnthe website of the vatican secret archives discussing a summary of legal proceedings against bruno in rome states in the same rooms where giordano bruno was questioned for the same important reasons of the relationship between science and faith at the dawning of the new astronomy and at the decline of aristotles philosophy sixteen years later cardinal bellarmino who then contested brunos heretical theses summoned galileo galilei who also faced a famous inquisitorial trial which luckily for him ended with a simple abjuration."nartistic depictionseditnfollowing the 1870 capture of rome by the newly created kingdom of italy and the end of the churchs temporal power over the city the erection of a monument to bruno on the site of his execution became feasible the monument was sharply opposed by the clerical party but was finally erected by the rome municipality and inaugurated in 1889.na statue of a stretched human figure standing on its head designed by alexander polzin and depicting brunos death at the stake was placed in potsdamer platz station in berlin on 2 march 2008.nnretrospective iconography of bruno shows him with a dominican cowl but not tonsured edward gosselin has suggested that it is likely bruno kept his tonsure at least until 1579 and it is possible that he wore it again thereafter.nan idealized animated version of bruno appears in the first episode of the 2014 television series cosmos a spacetime odyssey in this depiction bruno is shown with a more modern look without tonsure and wearing clerical
