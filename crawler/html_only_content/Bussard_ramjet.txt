bussard ramjet wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn artists conception of a bussard ramjet a major component of an actual ramjet a miles-wide electromagnetic field is invisible.nthe bussard ramjet is a theoretical method of spacecraft propulsion proposed in 1960 by the physicist robert w bussard popularized by poul andersons novel tau zero larry niven in his known space series of books vernor vinge in his zones of thought series and referred to by carl sagan in the television series and book cosmos.nbussard proposed a ramjet variant of a fusion rocket capable of reasonable interstellar travel using enormous electromagnetic fields ranging from kilometers to many thousands of kilometers in diameter as a ram scoop to collect and compress hydrogen from the interstellar medium high speeds force the reactive mass into a progressively constricted magnetic field compressing it until thermonuclear fusion occurs the magnetic field then directs the energy as rocket exhaust opposite to the intended direction of travel thereby accelerating the vessel.nncontentsnnnfeasibilityeditnsince the time of bussards original proposal it has been discovered that the region surrounding the solar system has a much lower density of hydrogen than was believed at that time see local interstellar cloud john ford fishback made an important contribution to the details for the bussard ramjet in 1969 t a heppenheimer analyzed bussards original suggestion of fusing protons but found the bremsstrahlung losses from compressing protons to fusion densities was greater than the power that could be produced by a factor of about 1 billion thus indicating that the proposed version of the bussard ramjet was infeasible however daniel p whitmires 1975 analysis indicates that a ramjet may achieve net power via the cno cycle which produces fusion at a much higher rate 10 times higher than the proton-proton chain.nrobert zubrin and dana andrews analyzed one hypothetical version of the bussard ramscoop and ramjet design in 1985 they determined that their version of the ramjet would be unable to accelerate into the solar wind however in their calculations they assumed that:nnnin the zubrin/andrews interplanetary ramjet design they calculated that the drag force d/dtmv equals the mass of the scooped ions collected per second multiplied by the velocity of the scooped ions within the solar system relative to the ramscoop the velocity of the scooped collected ions from the solar wind was assumed to be 500,000 m/s.nthe exhaust velocity of the ions when expelled by the ramjet was assumed not to exceed 100,000 m/s the thrust of the ramjet d/dtmv was equal to the mass of ions expelled per second multiplied by 100,000 meters per second in the zubrin/andrews design of 1985 this resulted in the condition that d/dtmv d/dtmv this condition resulted in the drag force exceeding the thrust of the hypothetical ramjet in the zubrin/andrews version of the design.nnrelated inventionseditnram augmented interstellar rocket raireditnthe problem of using the interstellar medium as the sole fuel source led to study of the ram augmented interstellar rocket rair the rair carries its nuclear fuel supply and exhausts the reaction products to produce some of its thrust however it greatly enhances its performance by scooping the interstellar medium and using this as extra reaction mass to augment the rocket the propulsion system of the rair consists of three subsystems a fusion reactor a scoop field and a plasma accelerator the scoop field funnels interstellar gas into an accelerator this could for example be a heat exchange system transferring thermal energy from the reactor directly to the interstellar gas which is supplied power from a reactor one of the best ways to understand this concept is to consider that the hydrogen nuclear fuel carried on board acts as a fuel energy source whereas the interstellar gas collected by the scoop and then exhausted at great speed from the back acts as a propellant the reaction mass the vehicle therefore has a limited fuel supply but an unlimited propellant supply a normal bussard ramjet would have an infinite supply of both however theory suggests that where a bussard ramjet would suffer drag from the fact that the interstellar gas ahead of it would have to be accelerated to its speed before entering the fusion reactor whereas a rair system would be able to transfer energy via the accelerator mechanism from the reactor to the interstellar gas without having to accelerate the gas up to the ships speed before putting this gas through the accelerator and so would suffer far less drag.nnlaser powered interstellar ramjeteditnbeamed energy coupled with a vehicle scooping hydrogen from the interstellar medium is another variant a laser array in the solar system beams to a collector on a vehicle which uses something like a linear accelerator to produce thrust this solves the fusion reactor problem for the ramjet there are limitations because of the attenuation of beamed energy with distance.nnmagnetic saileditnthe calculations by robert zubrin and an associate inspired the idea of a magnetic parachute or sail this could be important for interstellar travel because it means that deceleration at the destination can be performed with a magnetic parachute rather than a rocket.nnpre-seeded trajectoryeditnseveral of the obvious technical difficulties with the bussard ramjet can be overcome by prelaunching fuel along the spacecrafts trajectory using something like a magnetic rail-gun.nthe advantages of this system includennnthe major disadvantages of this system includennnreferenceseditnnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
