remain in the same relative position at any other point gravitational forces would pull a small object into an orbit around either one of the two bodies in a non-stable position relative to the other body.n lagrange points in the sunearth system not to scale a small object at any one of the five points will hold its relative position.n an example of a spacecraft at sunearth l2 wmap earthnin celestial mechanics the lagrangian points lrndin also lagrange points l-points or libration points are the points near two large bodies in orbit where a smaller object will maintain its position relative to the large orbiting bodies at other locations a small object would go into its own orbit around one of the large bodies but at the lagrangian points the gravitational forces of the two large bodies the centripetal force of orbital motion and for certain points the coriolis acceleration all match up in a way that cause the small object to maintain a stable or nearly stable position relative to the large bodies.nthere are five such points labeled l to l all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies for each given combination of two orbital bodies for instance there are five lagrangian points l to l for the sun-earth system and in a similar way there are five different langrangian points for the earth-moon system l l and l are on the line through the centers of the two large bodies l and l each form an equilateral triangle with the centers of the large bodies l and l are stable which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies.nseveral planets have trojan satellites near their l and l points with respect to the sun jupiter has more than a million of these trojans artificial satellites have been placed at l and l with respect to the sun and earth and with respect to the earth and the moon the lagrangian points have been proposed for uses in space exploration.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnthe three collinear lagrange points l l l were discovered by leonhard euler a few years before joseph-louis lagrange discovered the remaining two.nin 1772 lagrange published an essay on the three-body problem in the first chapter he considered the general three-body problem from that in the second chapter he demonstrated two special constant-pattern solutions the collinear and the equilateral for any three masses with circular orbits.nnlagrange pointseditnthe five lagrangian points are labeled and defined as follows:nnl pointeditnthe l point lies on the line defined by the two large masses m and m and between them it is the most intuitively understood of the lagrangian points the one where the gravitational attraction of m partially cancels ms gravitational attraction.nnnnnl pointeditnthe l point lies on the line through the two large masses beyond the smaller of the two here the gravitational forces of the two large masses balance the centrifugal effect on a body at l.nnnl pointeditnthe l point lies on the line defined by the two large masses beyond the larger of the two.nnnl and l pointseditn gravitational accelerations at lnthe l and l points lie at the third corners of the two equilateral triangles in the plane of orbit whose common base is the line between the centers of the two masses such that the point lies behind l or ahead l of the smaller mass with regard to its orbit around the larger mass.nthe triangular points l and l are stable equilibria provided that the ratio of m/m is greater than 24.96 this is the case for the sunearth system the sunjupiter system and by a smaller margin the earthmoon system when a body at these points is perturbed it moves away from the point but the factor opposite of that which is increased or decreased by the perturbation either gravity or angular momentum-induced speed will also increase or decrease bending the objects path into a stable kidney bean-shaped orbit around the point as seen in the corotating frame of reference.nin contrast to l and l where stable equilibrium exists the points l l and l are positions of unstable equilibrium any object orbiting at l l or l will tend to fall out of orbit it is therefore rare to find natural objects there and spacecraft inhabiting these areas must employ station keeping in order to maintain their position.nnnatural objects at lagrangian pointseditnmain article list of objects at lagrangian pointsnit is common to find objects at or orbiting the l and l points of natural orbital systems these are commonly called trojans in the 20th century asteroids discovered orbiting at the sunjupiter l and l points were named after characters from homers iliad asteroids at the l point which leads jupiter are referred to as the greek camp whereas those at the l point are referred to as the trojan camp nother examples of natural objects orbiting at lagrange points:nnnmathematical detailseditn a contour plot of the effective potential due to gravity and the

animation.nlagrangian points are the constant-pattern solutions of the restricted three-body problem for example given two massive bodies in orbits around their common barycenter there are five positions in space where a third body of comparatively negligible mass could be placed so as to maintain its position relative to the two massive bodies as seen in a rotating reference frame that matches the angular velocity of the two co-orbiting bodies the gravitational fields of two massive bodies combined providing the centripetal force at the lagrangian points allowing the smaller third body to be relatively stationary with respect to the first two.nnleditnthe location of l is the solution to the following equation gravitation providing the centripetal force:nnnwhere r is the distance of the l point from the smaller object r is the distance between the two main objects and m and m are the masses of the large and small object respectively solving this for r involves solving a quintic function but if the mass of the smaller object m is much smaller than the mass of the larger object m then l and l are at approximately equal distances r from the smaller object equal to the radius of the hill sphere given by:nnnthis distance can be described as being such that the orbital period corresponding to a circular orbit with this distance as radius around m in the absence of m is that of m around m divided by 3 1.73:nnnleditnthe location of l is the solution to the following equation gravitation providing the centripetal force:nnnwith parameters defined as for the l case again if the mass of the smaller object m is much smaller than the mass of the larger object m then l is at approximately the radius of the hill sphere given by:nnnleditnthe location of l is the solution to the following equation gravitation providing the centripetal force:nnnwith parameters defined as for the l and l cases except that r now indicates how much closer l is to the more massive object than the smaller object if the mass of the smaller object m is much smaller than the mass of the larger object m then:nnnl and leditnfurther information trojan celestial bodynthe reason these points are in balance is that at l and l the distances to the two masses are equal accordingly the gravitational forces from the two massive bodies are in the same ratio as the masses of the two bodies and so the resultant force acts through the barycenter of the system additionally the geometry of the triangle ensures that the resultant acceleration is to the distance from the barycenter in the same ratio as for the two massive bodies the barycenter being both the center of mass and center of rotation of the three-body system this resultant force is exactly that required to keep the smaller body at the lagrange point in orbital equilibrium with the other two larger bodies of system indeed the third body need not have negligible mass the general triangular configuration was discovered by lagrange in work on the three-body problem.nn net radial acceleration of a point orbiting along the earth-moon line.nradial accelerationeditnthe radial acceleration a of an object in orbit at a point along the line passing through both bodies is given by:nnnwhere r is the distance from the large body m and sgnx is the sign function of x the terms in this function represent respectively force from m force from m and centrifugal force the points l l l occur where the acceleration is zero see chart at right.nnstabilityeditnalthough the l l and l points are nominally unstable there are unstable periodic orbits called halo orbits around these points in a three-body system a full n-body dynamical system such as the solar system does not contain these periodic orbits but does contain quasi-periodic i.e bounded but not precisely repeating orbits following lissajous-curve trajectories these quasi-periodic lissajous orbits are what most of lagrangian-point space missions have used until now although they are not perfectly stable a modest effort of station keeping keeps a spacecraft in a desired lissajous orbit for a long time also for sunearth-l missions it is preferable for the spacecraft to be in a large-amplitude 100,000200,000 km or 62,000124,000 mi lissajous orbit around l than to stay at l because the line between sun and earth has increased solar interference on earthspacecraft communications similarly a large-amplitude lissajous orbit around l keeps a probe out of earths shadow and therefore ensures continuous illumination of its solar panels.nthe l and l points are stable provided that the mass of the primary body e.g the earth is at least 25 times the mass of the secondary body e.g the moon the earth is over 81 times the mass of the moon the moon is 1.23 of the mass of the earth although the l and l points are found at the top of a hill as in the effective potential contour plot above they are nonetheless stable the reason for the stability is a second-order effect as a body moves away from the exact lagrange position coriolis acceleration which depends on the velocity of an orbiting object and cannot be modeled as a contour map curves the trajectory into a path around rather than away from the point.nnsolar system valueseditnthis table lists sample values of l l and l within the solar system calculations assume the two bodies orbit in a perfect circle with separation equal to the semimajor axis and no other bodies are nearby distances are measured from the larger bodys center of mass with l showing a negative location the percentage columns show how the distances compare to the semimajor axis e.g for the moon l is located 7008326400000000000326400 km from earths center which is 84.9 of the earth-moon distance or 15.1 in front of the moon l is located 7008448900000000000448900 km from earths center which is 116.8 of the earth-moon distance or 16.8 beyond the moon and l is located 2991618300000000000381700 km from earths center which is 99.3 of the earth-moon distance or 0.7084 in front of the moons negative position nnnspaceflight applicationseditnsuneartheditn the satellite ace in an orbit around sun-earth l.nsunearth l is suited for making observations of the sunearth system objects here are never shadowed by earth or the moon and if observing earth always view the sunlit hemisphere the first mission of this type was the 1978 international sun earth explorer 3 isee-3 mission used as an interplanetary early warning storm monitor for solar disturbances since june 2015 dscovr has orbited the l point conversely it is also useful for space-based solar telescopes because it provides an uninterrupted view of the sun and any space weather including the solar wind and coronal mass ejections reaches l a few hours before earth solar telescopes currently located around l include the solar and heliospheric observatory and advanced composition explorer.nsunearth l is a good spot for space-based observatories because an object around l will maintain the same relative position with respect to the sun and earth shielding and calibration are much simpler it is however slightly beyond the reach of earths umbra so solar radiation is not completely blocked at l real spacecraft generally orbit around l avoiding partial eclipses of the sun to maintain a constant temperature from locations near l the sun earth and moon are relatively close together in the sky this means that a large sunshade with the telescope on the dark-side can allow the telescope to cool passively to around 50 k this is especially helpful for infrared astronomy and observations of the cosmic microwave background the james webb space telescope is due to be positioned at l.nsunearth l was a popular place to put a counter-earth in pulp science fiction and comic books once space-based observation became possible via satellites and probes it was shown to hold no such object the sunearth l is unstable and could not contain a natural object large or small for very long this is because the gravitational forces of the other planets are stronger than that of earth venus for example comes within 0.3 au of this l every 20 months.na spacecraft orbiting near sunearth l would be able to closely monitor the evolution of active sunspot regions before they rotate into a geoeffective position so that a 7-day early warning could be issued by the noaa space weather prediction center moreover a satellite near sunearth l would provide very important observations not only for earth forecasts but also for deep space support mars predictions and for manned mission to near-earth asteroids in 2010 spacecraft transfer trajectories to sunearth l were studied and several designs were considered.nmissions to lagrangian points generally orbit the points rather than occupy them directly.nanother interesting and useful property of the collinear lagrangian points and their associated lissajous orbits is that they serve as gateways to control the chaotic trajectories of the interplanetary transport network.nnearthmooneditnearthmoon l allows comparatively easy access to lunar and earth orbits with minimal change in velocity and this has as an advantage to position a half-way manned space station intended to help transport cargo and personnel to the moon and back.nearthmoon l has been used for a communications satellite covering the moons far side for example queqiao launched in may 2018 and would be an ideal location for a propellant depot as part of the proposed depot-based space transportation architecture.nnsunvenuseditnscientists at the b612 foundation are planning to use venuss l point to position their planned sentinel telescope which aims to look back towards earths orbit and compile a catalogue of near-earth asteroids.nnsunmarseditnin 2017 nasa proposed the idea of positioning a magnetic dipole shield at the sun-mars l point for use as an artificial magnetosphere for mars the idea is that this would protect the planets atmosphere from the suns radiation and solar winds.nnlagrangian spacecraft and missionseditnmain article list of
