satellite navigation wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnany system that uses satellite radio signals to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioningna satellite navigation or satnav system is a system that uses satellites to provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning it allows small electronic receivers to determine their location longitude latitude and altitude/elevation to high precision within a few metres using time signals transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites the system can be used for providing position navigation or for tracking the position of something fitted with a receiver satellite tracking the signals also allow the electronic receiver to calculate the current local time to high precision which allows time synchronisation satnav systems operate independently of any telephonic or internet reception though these technologies can enhance the usefulness of the positioning information generated.na satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a global navigation satellite system gnss as of october 2018 the united states global positioning system gps and russias glonass are fully operational gnsss with chinas beidou navigation satellite system bds and the european unions galileo scheduled to be fully operational by 2020 india france and japan are in the process of developing regional navigation and augmentation systems as well.nglobal coverage for each system is generally achieved by a satellite constellation of 1830 medium earth orbit meo satellites spread between several orbital planes the actual systems vary but use orbital inclinations of 50 and orbital periods of roughly twelve hours at an altitude of about 20,000 kilometres or 12,000 miles.nncontentsnnnclassificationeditnsatellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows:nnnhistory and theoryeditn nground based radio navigation has long been practiced the decca loran gee and omega systems used terrestrial longwave radio transmitters which broadcast a radio pulse from a known master location followed by a pulse repeated from a number of slave stations the delay between the reception of the master signal and the slave signals allowed the receiver to deduce the distance to each of the slaves providing a fix.nthe first satellite navigation system was transit a system deployed by the us military in the 1960s transits operation was based on the doppler effect the satellites travelled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well-known radio frequency the received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver by monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellites orbit can fix a particular position satellite orbital position errors are induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction among others these were resolved by a team led by harold l jury of pan am aerospace division in florida from 1970-1973 using real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation the systematic and residual errors were narrowed down to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation npart of an orbiting satellites broadcast included its precise orbital data in order to ensure accuracy the us naval observatory usno continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites as a satellites orbit deviated the usno would send the updated information to the satellite subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain its most recent ephemeris.nmodern systems are more direct the satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data from which the position of the satellite can be calculated and the precise time the signal was transmitted the orbital ephemeris is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference the satellite uses an atomic clock to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation the receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission of three at sea level or four different satellites thereby measuring the time-of-flight to each satellite several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of trilateration see gnss positioning calculation for details.neach distance measurement regardless of the system being used places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster by taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet a fix is generated however in the case of fast-moving receivers the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites in addition the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere and this slowing varies with the receivers angle to the satellite because that changes the distance through the ionosphere the basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centred on four satellites satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and multiple correlators and then using techniques such as kalman filtering to combine the noisy partial and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position time and velocity.nnapplicationseditn automotive navigation systemnmain article gnss applicationsnfurther information automotive navigation systemnthe original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications satellite navigation allows precision in the delivery of weapons to targets greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons see guided bomb satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily reducing the fog
