horizon wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnfor other uses see horizon disambiguation.n a high desert horizon at sunset california usanthe horizon or skyline is the apparent line that separates earth from sky the line that divides all visible directions into two categories those that intersect the earths surface and those that do not.nthe true horizon is actually a theoretical line which can only be observed when it lies on the sea surface at many locations this line is obscured by land trees buildings mountains etc and the resulting intersection of earth and sky is called the visible horizon when looking at a sea from a shore the part of the sea closest to the horizon is called the offing.nthe true horizon is horizontal it surrounds the observer and it is typically assumed to be a circle drawn on the surface of a perfectly spherical model of the earth its center is below the observer and below sea level its distance from the observer varies from day to day due to atmospheric refraction which is greatly affected by weather conditions also the higher the observers eyes are from sea level the farther away is the horizon from the observer for instance in standard athmosferic conditions for an observer with eye level above sea level by 1.70 metres 5 ft 7 in the horizon is at a distance of about 5 kilometres 3.1 mi.nwhen observed from very high standpoints such as a space station the horizon is much farther away and it encompasses a much larger area of earths surface in this case it becomes evident that the horizon more closely resembles an ellipse than a perfect circle especially when the observer is above the equator and that the earths surface can be better modeled as an ellipsoid than as a sphere.nthe word horizon derives from the greek horizn kyklos separating circle where is from the verb horiz to divide to separate which in turn derives from oros boundary landmark".nncontentsnnnappearance and usageeditn view of the ocean with a ship near to the horizonnhistorically the distance to the visible horizon has long been vital to survival and successful navigation especially at sea because it determined an observers maximum range of vision and thus of communication with all the obvious consequences for safety and the transmission of information that this range implied this importance lessened with the development of the radio and the telegraph but even today when flying an aircraft under visual flight rules a technique called attitude flying is used to control the aircraft where the pilot uses the visual relationship between the aircrafts nose and the horizon to control the aircraft a pilot can also retain his or her spatial orientation by referring to the horizon.nin many contexts especially perspective drawing the curvature of the earth is disregarded and the horizon is considered the theoretical line to which points on any horizontal plane converge when projected onto the picture plane as their distance from the observer increases for observers near sea level the difference between this geometrical horizon which assumes a perfectly flat infinite ground plane and the true horizon which assumes a spherical earth surface is imperceptible to the naked eye but for someone on a 1000-meter hill looking out to sea the true horizon will be about a degree below a horizontal line.nin astronomy the horizon is the horizontal plane through the eyes of the observer it is the fundamental plane of the horizontal coordinate system the locus of points that have an altitude of zero degrees while similar in ways to the geometrical horizon in this context a horizon may be considered to be a plane in space rather than a line on a picture plane.nndistance to the horizoneditnone typically sees further along the earths curved surface than a simple geometric calculation allows for because of refraction error if the ground or water surface is colder than the air above it a cold dense layer of air forms close to the surface causing light to be refracted downward as it travels and therefore to some extent to go around the curvature of the earth the reverse happens if the ground is hotter than the air above it as often happens in deserts producing mirages as an approximate compensation for refraction surveyors measuring distances longer than 100 meters subtract 14 from the calculated curvature error and ensure lines of sight are at least 1.5 meters from the ground to reduce random errors created by refraction.nn typical desert horizonnhowever ignoring the effect of atmospheric refraction distance to the

planets and other solid celestial bodies with negligible atmospheric effects the distance to the horizon for a standard observer varies as the square root of the planets radius thus the horizon on mercury is 62 as far away from the observer as it is on earth on mars the figure is 73 on the moon the figure is 52 on mimas the figure is 18 and so on.nngeometrical modeleditn geometrical basis for

substitutions:nnnthe formula now becomesnnnornnnwhere r is the radius of the earth.nthe equation can also be derived using the pythagorean theorem.nsince the line of sight is a tangent to the earth it is perpendicular to the radius at the horizon this sets up a right triangle with the sum of the radius and the height as the hypotenuse withnnnreferring to the second figure at the right leads to the following:nnnanother relationship involves the distance s along the curved surface of the earth to the horizon with in radians,nnnthennnnsolving for s givesnnnthe distance s can also be expressed in terms of the line-of-sight distance d from the second figure at the right,nnnsubstituting for and rearranging givesnnnthe distances d and s are nearly the same when the height of the object is

straight line distance and d is the approximate straight line distance assuming h the radius of the earth 6371 km in the svg image hover over a graph to highlight it.nif the observer is close to the surface of the earth then it is valid to disregard h in the term 2r h and the formula becomes-nnnusing kilometres for d and r and metres for h and taking the radius of the earth as 6371 km the distance to the horizon isnnnusing imperial units with d and r in statute miles as commonly used on land and h in feet the distance to the horizon isnnnif d is in nautical miles and h in feet the constant factor is about 1.06 which is close enough to 1 that it is often ignored giving:nnnthese formulas may be used when h is much smaller than the radius of the earth 6371 km or 3959 mi including all views from any mountaintops airplanes or high-altitude balloons with the constants as given both the metric and imperial formulas are precise to within 1 see the next section for how to obtain greater precision.nnexact formula for a spherical eartheditnif h is significant with respect to r as with most satellites then the approximation made previously is no longer valid and the exact formula is required:nnnwhere r is the radius of the earth r and h must be in the same units for example,nif a satellite is at a height of 2000 km the distance to the horizon is 5,430 kilometres 3,370 mi;nneglecting the second term in parentheses would give a distance of 5,048 kilometres 3,137 mi a 7 error.nnobjects above the horizoneditn geometrical horizon distancento compute the greatest distance at which an observer can see the top of an object above the horizon compute the distance to the horizon for a hypothetical observer on top of that object and add it to the real observers distance to the horizon for example for an observer with a height of 1.70 m standing on the ground the horizon is 4.65 km away for a tower with a height of 100 m the horizon distance is 35.7 km thus an observer on a beach can see the top of the tower as long as it is not more than 40.35 km away conversely if an observer on a boat h 1.7 m can just see the tops of trees on a nearby shore h 10 m the trees are probably about 16 km away.nreferring to the figure at the right the top of the lighthouse will be visible to a lookout in a crows nest at the top of a mast of the boat ifnnnwhere d is in kilometres and h and h are in metres.nn a view across a 20-km-wide bay in the coast of spain note the curvature of the earth hiding the base of the buildings on the far shore.nas another example suppose an observer whose eyes are two metres above the level ground uses binoculars to look at a distant building which he knows to consist of thirty storeys each 3.5 metres high he counts the storeys he can see and finds there are only ten so twenty storeys or 70 metres of the building are hidden from him by the curvature of the earth from this he can calculate his distance from the building:nnnwhich comes to about 35 kilometres.nit is similarly possible to calculate how much of a distant object is visible above the horizon suppose an observers eye is 10 metres above sea level and he is watching a ship that is 20 km away his horizon is:nnnkilometres from him which comes to about 11.3 kilometres away the ship is a further 8.7 km away the height of a point on the ship that is just visible to the observer is given by:nnnwhich comes to almost exactly six metres the observer can therefore see that part of the ship that is more than six metres above the level of the water the part of the ship that is below this height is hidden from him by the curvature of the earth in this situation the ship is said to be hull-down.nneffect of atmospheric refractioneditnif the earth were an airless world like the moon the above calculations would be accurate however earth has an atmosphere of air whose density and refractive index vary considerably depending on the temperature and pressure this makes the air refract light to varying extents affecting the appearance of the horizon usually the density of the air just above the surface of the earth is greater than its density at greater altitudes this makes its refractive index greater near the surface than at higher altitudes which causes light that is travelling roughly horizontally to be refracted downward this makes the actual distance to the horizon greater than the distance calculated with geometrical formulas with standard atmospheric conditions the difference is about 8 this changes the factor of 3.57 in the metric formulas used above to about 3.86 for instance if an observer is standing on seashore with eyes 1,70 m above sea level according to the simple geometrical formulas given above the horizon should be 4,7 km away actually atmospheric refraction allows the observer to see 300 metres farther moving the true horizon 5 km away from the observer.nthis correction can be and often is applied as a fairly good approximation when atmospheric conditions are close to standard when conditions are unusual this approximation fails refraction is strongly affected by temperature gradients which can vary considerably from day to day especially over water in extreme cases usually in springtime when warm air overlies cold water refraction can allow light to follow the earths surface for hundreds of kilometres opposite conditions occur for example in deserts where the surface is very hot so hot low-density air is below cooler air this causes light to be refracted upward causing mirage effects that make the concept of the horizon somewhat meaningless calculated values for the effects of refraction under unusual conditions are therefore only approximate nevertheless attempts have been made to calculate them more accurately than the simple approximation described above.noutside the visual wavelength range refraction will be different for radar e.g for wavelengths 300 to 3 mm i.e frequencies between 1 and 100 ghz the radius of the earth may be multiplied by 4/3 to obtain an effective radius giving a factor of 4.12 in the metric formula i.e the radar horizon will be 15 beyond the geometrical horizon or 7 beyond the visual the 4/3 factor is not exact as in the visual case the refraction depends on atmospheric conditions.nnnif the density profile of the atmosphere is known the distance d to the horizon is given bynnnwhere r is the radius of the earth is the dip of the horizon and is the refraction of the horizon the dip is determined fairly simply fromnnnwhere h is the

m,nnnwith d in mi and h in ft,nnnresults from youngs method are quite close to those from sweers method and are sufficiently accurate for many purposes.nncurvature of the horizoneditnn the curvature of the horizon is easily seen in this 2008 photograph taken from a space shuttle at an altitude of 226 km 140 mi.nfrom a point above earths surface the horizon appears slightly convex it is a circular arc the following formula expresses the basic geometrical relationship between this visual curvature the altitude and earths radius nnnthe curvature is the reciprocal of the curvature angular radius in radians a curvature of 1.0 appears as a circle of an angular radius of 57.3 corresponding to an altitude of approximately 2,640 km 1,640 mi above earths surface at an altitude of 10 km 6.2 mi 33,000 ft the cruising altitude of a typical airliner the mathematical curvature of the horizon is about 0.056 the same curvature of the rim of circle with a radius of 10 m that is viewed from 56 cm directly above the center of the circle however the apparent curvature is less than that due to refraction of light by the atmosphere and the obscuration of the horizon by high cloud layers that reduce the altitude above the visual surface.nnvanishing pointseditn two points on the horizon are at the intersections of the lines extending the segments representing the edges of the building in the foreground the horizon line coincides here with the line at the top of the doors and windows.nmain article vanishing pointnthe horizon is a key feature of the picture plane in the science of graphical perspective assuming the picture plane stands vertical to ground and p is the perpendicular projection of the eye point o on the picture plane the horizon is defined as the horizontal line through p the point p is the vanishing point of lines perpendicular to the picture if s is another point on the horizon then it is the vanishing point for all lines parallel to os but brook taylor 1719 indicated that the horizon plane determined by o and the horizon was like any other plane:nnnthe peculiar geometry of perspective where parallel lines converge in the distance stimulated the development of projective geometry which posits a point at infinity where parallel lines meet in her book geometry of an art 2007 kirsti andersen described the evolution of perspective drawing and science up to 1800 noting that vanishing points need not be on the horizon in a chapter titled horizon john stillwell recounted how projective geometry has led to incidence geometry the modern abstract study of line intersection stillwell also ventured into foundations of mathematics in a section titled what are the laws of algebra the algebra of points originally given by karl von staudt
