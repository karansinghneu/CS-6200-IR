gauss unit wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnthe gauss abbreviated as g or gs is the cgs unit of measurement of magnetic flux density or magnetic induction b it is named after german mathematician and physicist carl friedrich gauss one gauss is defined as one maxwell per square centimeter the cgs system has been superseded by the international system of units si which uses the tesla symbol t as the unit of magnetic flux density one gauss equals 110 tesla 100 t so 1 tesla 10,000 gauss.nncontentsnnnunit name and conventioneditnas with all units whose names are derived from a persons name the first letter of its symbol is uppercase g but when the unit is spelled out it should be written in lowercase gauss unless it begins a sentence.nnunit conversionseditnnaccording to the system of gaussian units cgs the gauss is the unit of magnetic flux density b and the equivalent of mx/cm while the oersted is the unit of magnetizing field h one tesla t is equal to 10 gauss and one ampere a per meter is equal to 4 x 10 oersted.nthe units for magnetic flux which is the integral of magnetic field over an area are the weber wb in the si and the maxwell mx in the cgs system the conversion factor is 10 since flux is the integral of field over an area area having the units of the square of distance thus 10 magnetic field conversion factor times the square of 10 linear distance conversion factor i.e centimetres per meter 1010 xn10.nntypical valueseditnmain article orders of magnitude magnetic fieldnnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnnnn ncategories n
