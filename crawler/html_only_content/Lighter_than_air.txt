lighter than air wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnlighter than air refers to materials usually gases that are buoyant in air because they have average densities lower than that of air dry air has a density of about 1.29 g/l gram per liter at standard conditions for temperature and pressure stp and an average molecular mass of 28.97 g/mol.nsome of these gases are used as lifting gases in lighter-than-air aircraft which include free balloons moored balloons and airships heavier-than-air aircraft include airplanes gliders and helicopters.nncontentsnnnusage as lifting gaseditnmain article lifting gasnhot aireditnhot air is frequently used in recreational ballooning hot air is lighter than air at ambient temperature to a degree which can be approximated using the ideal gas law.nnneoneditnneon density 0.900 g/l at stp average atomic mass 20.17g/mol is lighter than air and will lift a balloon however it is relatively rare on earth expensive and is among the heavier of the lifting gases.nnwater vaporeditnwater vapor density 0.804 g/l at stp average molecular mass 18.015 g/mol is lighter than air and has successfully been used as a lifting gas it is generally impractical due to high boiling point and condensation.nnammoniaeditnammonia density 0.769 g/l at stp average molecular mass 17.03 g/mol has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons due to its relatively high boiling point compared to helium and hydrogen ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquified aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast.nnmethaneeditnmethane density 0.716 g/l at stp average molecular mass 16.04 g/mol is the chief component of natural gas and is sometimes used as a lift gas when hydrogen and helium are not available it has the advantage of not leaking through balloon walls as rapidly as the small-moleculed hydrogen and helium many lighter-than-air balloons are made of aluminized plastic that limits such leakage hydrogen and helium leak rapidly through latex balloons.nnhydrogen and heliumeditnhydrogen density 0.090 g/l at stp average molecular mass 2.016 g/mol and helium density 0.179 g/l at stp average molecular mass 4.003 g/mol are the most commonly used lift gases although helium is twice as heavy as diatomic hydrogen they are both much lighter than air that this difference only results in hydrogen having 8 more buoyancy than helium.nin a practical dirigible design the difference is significant making a 50 difference in the fuel-carrying capacity of the dirigible and hence increasing its range significantly however hydrogen is extremely flammable and its use as a lifting gas in dirigibles has decreased since the hindenburg disaster helium is safer as a lifting gas because it is inert and does not undergo combustion nnotherseditnnitrogeneditnnitrogen gas density 1.251 g/l at stp average atomic mass 28.00 g/mol is about 3 lighter than air insufficient for common use as a lifting gas.nnsolidseditnin 2002 aerogel held the guinness world record for the least dense lightest solid aerogel is mostly air because its structure is like that of a highly vacuous sponge the lightness and low density is due primarily to the large proportion of air within the solid and not the silicon construction materials taking advantage of this seagel in the same family as aerogel but made from agar can be filled with helium gas to create a solid which floats when placed in an open top container filled with a dense gas.nin 2012 discovery of aerographite was announced breaking the record for the least dense material at only 0.2 mg/cm 0.2 kg/m these solids do not float in air because the hollow spaces in them become filled with air no lighter-than-air matrix or shell containing a hard vacuum has ever been constructed.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
