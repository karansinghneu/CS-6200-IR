communications satellite wikipedia n redirected from telecommunications satelliten jump to navigationnjump to searchn an advanced extremely high frequency communications orion satellite centre relays secure communications for the united states and other allied countries.na communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on earth communications satellites are used for television telephone radio internet and military applications there are 2,134 communications satellites in earths orbit used by both private and government organizations many are in geostationary orbit 22,200 miles 35,700 km above the equator so that the satellite appears stationary at the same point in the sky so the satellite dish antennas of ground stations can be aimed permanently at that spot and do not have to move to track it.nthe high frequency radio waves used for telecommunications links travel by line of sight and so are obstructed by the curve of the earth the purpose of communications satellites is to relay the signal around the curve of the earth allowing communication between widely separated geographical points communications satellites use a wide range of radio and microwave frequencies to avoid signal interference international organizations have regulations for which frequency ranges or bands certain organizations are allowed to use this allocation of bands minimizes the risk of signal interference.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnthe concept of the geostationary communications satellite was first proposed by arthur c clarke along with vahid k sanadi building on work by konstantin tsiolkovsky in october 1945 clarke published an article titled extraterrestrial relays in the british magazine wireless world the article described the fundamentals behind the deployment of artificial satellites in geostationary orbits for the purpose of relaying radio signals thus arthur c clarke is often quoted as being the inventor of the communications satellite and the term clarke belt employed as a description of the orbit.ndecades later a project named communication moon relay was a telecommunication project carried out by the united states navy its objective was to develop a secure and reliable method of wireless communication by using the moon as a passive reflector and a natural communications satellite.nthe first artificial earth satellite was sputnik 1 put into orbit by the soviet union on october 4 1957 it was equipped with an on-board radio-transmitter that worked on two frequencies 20.005 and 40.002 mhz sputnik 1 was launched as a major step in the exploration of space and rocket development however it was not placed in orbit for the purpose of sending data from one point on earth to another.nthe first satellite to relay communications was pioneer 1 an intended lunar probe though the spacecraft only made it about halfway to the moon it flew high enough to carry out the proof of concept relay of telemetry across the world first from cape canaveral to manchester england then from hawaii to cape canaveral and finally across the world from hawaii to manchester.nthe first satellite purpose-built to relay communications was nasas project score in 1958 which used a tape recorder to store and forward voice messages it was used to send a christmas greeting to the world from u.s president dwight d eisenhower courier 1b built by philco launched in 1960 was the worlds first active repeater satellite.nthe first artificial satellite used solely to further advances in global communications was a balloon named echo 1 echo 1 was the worlds first artificial communications satellite capable of relaying signals to other points on earth it soared 1,600 kilometres 1,000 mi above the planet after its aug 12 1960 launch yet relied on humanitys oldest flight technology ballooning launched by nasa echo 1 was a 30-metre 100 ft aluminized pet film balloon that served as a passive reflector for radio communications the worlds first inflatable satellite or satelloon as they were informally known helped lay the foundation of todays satellite communications the idea behind a communications satellite is simple send data up into space and beam it back down to another spot on the globe echo 1 accomplished this by essentially serving as an enormous mirror 10 stories tall that could be used to reflect communications signals.nthere are two major classes of communications satellites passive and active passive satellites only reflect the signal coming from the source toward the direction of the receiver with passive satellites the reflected signal is not amplified at the satellite and only a very small amount of the transmitted energy actually reaches the receiver since the satellite is so far above earth the radio signal is attenuated due to free-space path loss so the signal received on earth is very very weak active satellites on the other hand amplify the received signal before retransmitting it to the receiver on the ground passive satellites were the first communications satellites but are little used now.ntelstar was the second active direct relay communications satellite belonging to at&t as part of a multi-national agreement between at&t bell telephone laboratories nasa the british general post office and the french national ptt post office to develop satellite communications it was launched by nasa from cape canaveral on july 10 1962 in the first privately sponsored space launch relay 1 was launched on december 13 1962 and it became the first satellite to transmit across the pacific ocean on november 22 1963.nan immediate antecedent of the geostationary satellites was the hughes aircraft companys syncom 2 launched on july 26 1963 syncom 2 was the first communications satellite in a geosynchronous orbit it revolved around the earth once per day at constant speed but because it still had north-south motion special equipment was needed to track it its successor syncom 3 was the first geostationary communications satellite syncom 3 obtained a geosynchronous orbit without a north-south motion making it appear from the ground as a stationary object in the sky.nbeginning with the mars exploration rovers landers on the surface of mars have used orbiting spacecraft as communications satellites for relaying their data to earth the landers use uhf transmitters to send their data to the orbiters which then relay the data to earth using either x band or ka band frequencies these higher frequencies along with more powerful transmitters and larger antennas permit the orbiters to send the data much faster than the landers could manage transmitting directly to earth which conserves valuable time on the nasa deep space network.nnsatellite orbitseditncommunications satellites usually have one of three primary types of orbit while other orbital classifications are used to further specify orbital details.nnnas satellites in meo and leo orbit the earth faster they do not remain visible in the sky to a fixed point on earth continually like a geostationary satellite but appear to a ground observer to cross the sky and set when they go behind the earth therefore to provide continuous communications capability with these lower orbits requires a larger number of satellites so one will always be in the sky for transmission of communication signals however due to their relatively small distance to the earth their signals are stronger.nnlow earth orbit leoeditnmain article low earth orbitn low earth orbit in cyanna low earth orbit leo typically is a circular orbit about 160 to 2,000 kilometres 99 to 1,243 mi above the earths surface and correspondingly a period time to revolve around the earth of about 90 minutes.nbecause of their low altitude these satellites are only visible from within a radius of roughly 1,000 kilometres 620 mi from the sub-satellite point in addition satellites in low earth orbit change their position relative to the ground position quickly so even for local applications a large number of satellites are needed if the mission requires uninterrupted connectivity.nlow-earth-orbiting satellites are less expensive to launch into orbit than geostationary satellites and due to proximity to the ground do not require as high signal strength recall that signal strength falls off as the square of the distance from the source so the effect is dramatic thus there is a trade off between the number of satellites and their cost.nin addition there are important differences in the onboard and ground equipment needed to support the two types of missions.nnsatellite constellationeditnmain article satellite constellationna group of satellites working in concert is known as a satellite constellation two such constellations intended to provide satellite phone services primarily to remote areas are the iridium and globalstar systems the iridium system has 66 satellites.nit is also possible to offer discontinuous coverage using a low-earth-orbit satellite capable of storing data received while passing over one part of earth and transmitting it later while passing over another part this will be the case with the cascade system of canadas cassiope communications satellite another system using this store and forward method is orbcomm.nnmedium earth orbit meoeditnmain article medium earth orbitna meo is a satellite in orbit somewhere between 2,000 and 35,786 kilometres 1,243 and 22,236 mi above the earths surface meo satellites are similar to leo satellites in functionality meo satellites are visible for much longer periods of time than leo satellites usually between 2 and 8 hours meo satellites have a larger coverage area than leo satellites a meo satellites longer duration of visibility and wider footprint means fewer satellites are needed in a meo network than a leo network one disadvantage is that a meo satellites distance gives it a longer time delay and weaker signal than a leo satellite although these limitations are not as severe as those of a geo satellite.nlike leos these satellites dont maintain a stationary distance from the earth this is in contrast to the geostationary orbit where satellites are always 35,786 kilometres 22,236 mi from the earth.ntypically the orbit of a medium earth orbit satellite is about 16,000 kilometres 10,000 mi above earth in various patterns these satellites make the trip around earth in anywhere from 2 to 8 hours.nnexampleeditnin 1962 the first communications satellite telstar was launched it was a medium earth orbit satellite designed to help facilitate high-speed telephone signals although it was the first practical way to transmit signals over the horizon its major drawback was soon realized because its orbital period of about 2.5 hours did not match the earths rotational period of 24 hours continuous coverage was impossible it was apparent that multiple meos needed to be used in order to provide continuous coverage.nngeostationary orbit geoeditnmain article geostationary orbitn geostationary orbitnto an observer on earth a satellite in a geostationary orbit appears motionless in a fixed position in the sky this is because it revolves around the earth at earths own angular velocity one revolution per sidereal day in an equatorial orbit.na geostationary orbit is useful for communications because ground antennas can be aimed at the satellite without their having to track the satellites motion this is relatively inexpensive.nin applications that require a large number of ground antennas such as directv distribution the savings in ground equipment can more than outweigh the cost and complexity of placing a satellite into orbit.nnexampleseditnnby 2000 hughes space and communications now boeing satellite development center had built nearly 40 percent of the more than one hundred satellites in service worldwide other major satellite manufacturers include space systems/loral orbital sciences corporation with the star bus series indian space research organisation lockheed martin owns the former rca astro electronics/ge astro space business northrop grumman alcatel space now thales alenia space with the spacebus series and astrium.nnmolniya orbiteditnmain article molniya orbitngeostationary satellites must operate above the equator and therefore appear lower on the horizon as the receiver gets farther from the equator this will cause problems for extreme northerly latitudes affecting connectivity and causing multipath interference caused by signals reflecting off the ground and into the ground antenna.nthus for areas close to the north and south pole a geostationary satellite may appear below the horizon therefore molniya orbit satellites have been launched mainly in russia to alleviate this problem.nmolniya orbits can be an appealing alternative in such cases the molniya orbit is highly inclined guaranteeing good elevation over selected positions during the northern portion of the orbit elevation is the extent of the satellites position above the horizon thus a satellite at the horizon has zero elevation and a satellite directly overhead has elevation of 90 degrees.nthe molniya orbit is designed so that the satellite spends the great majority of its time over the far northern latitudes during which its ground footprint moves only slightly its period is one half day so that the satellite is available for operation over the targeted region for six to nine hours every second revolution in this way a constellation of three molniya satellites plus in-orbit spares can provide uninterrupted coverage.nthe first satellite of the molniya series was launched on april 23 1965 and was used for experimental transmission of tv signals from a moscow uplink station to downlink stations located in siberia and the russian far east in norilsk khabarovsk magadan and vladivostok in november 1967 soviet engineers created a unique system of national tv network of satellite television called orbita that was based on molniya satellites.nnpolar orbiteditnmain article polar orbitnin the united states the national polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite system npoess was established in 1994 to consolidate the polar satellite operations ofnnasa national aeronautics and space administration nnoaa national oceanic and atmospheric administration npoess manages a number of satellites for various purposes for example metsat for meteorological satellite eumetsat for the european branch of the program and metop for meteorological operations.nthese orbits are sun synchronous meaning that they cross the equator at the same local time each day for example the satellites in the npoess civilian orbit will cross the equator going from south to north at times 1:30 p.m 5:30 p.m and 9:30 p.m.nnstructureeditncommunications satellites are usually composed of the following subsystems:nnnthe bandwidth available from a satellite depends upon the number of transponders provided by the satellite each service tv voice internet radio requires a different amount of bandwidth for transmission this is typically known as link budgeting and a network simulator can be used to arrive at the exact value.nnfrequency allocation for satellite systemseditnallocating frequencies to satellite services is a complicated process which requires international coordination and planning this is carried out under the auspices of the international telecommunication union itu.nto facilitate frequency planning the world is divided into three regions:nregion 1 europe africa what was formerly the soviet union and mongolianregion 2 north and south america and greenlandnregion 3 asia excluding region 1 areas australia and the southwest pacificnwithin these regions frequency bands are allocated to various satellite services although a given service may be allocated different frequency bands in different regions some of the services provided by satellites are:nnnapplicationseditntelephoneeditnmain article satellite phonen an iridium satellitenthe first and historically most important application for communication satellites was in intercontinental long distance telephony the fixed public switched telephone network relays telephone calls from land line telephones to an earth station where they are then transmitted to a geostationary satellite the downlink follows an analogous path improvements in submarine communications cables through the use of fiber-optics caused some decline in the use of satellites for fixed telephony in the late 20th century.nsatellite communications are still used in many applications today remote islands such as ascension island saint helena diego garcia and easter island where no submarine cables are in service need satellite telephones there are also regions of some continents and countries where landline telecommunications are rare to nonexistent for example large regions of south america africa canada china russia and australia satellite communications also provide connection to the edges of antarctica and greenland other land use for satellite phones are rigs at sea a back up for hospitals military and recreation ships at sea as well as planes often use satellite phones.nsatellite phone systems can be accomplished by a number of means on a large scale often there will be a local telephone system in an isolated area with a link to the telephone system in a main land area there are also services that will patch a radio signal to a telephone system in this example almost any type of satellite can be used satellite phones connect directly to a constellation of either geostationary or low-earth-orbit satellites calls are then forwarded to a satellite teleport connected to the public switched telephone network nntelevisioneditnmain article satellite televisionnas television became the main market its demand for simultaneous delivery of relatively few signals of large bandwidth to many receivers being a more precise match for the capabilities of geosynchronous comsats two satellite types are used for north american television and radio direct broadcast satellite dbs and fixed service satellite fss.nthe definitions of fss and dbs satellites outside of north america especially in europe are a bit more ambiguous most satellites used for direct-to-home television in europe have the same high power output as dbs-class satellites in north america but use the same linear polarization as fss-class satellites examples of these are the astra eutelsat and hotbird spacecraft in orbit over the european continent because of this the terms fss and dbs are more so used throughout the north american continent and are uncommon in europe.nfixed service satellites use the c band and the lower portions of the k band they are normally used for broadcast feeds to and from television networks and local affiliate stations such as program feeds for network and syndicated programming live shots and backhauls as well as being used for distance learning by schools and universities business television btv videoconferencing and general commercial telecommunications fss satellites are also used to distribute national cable channels to cable television headends.nfree-to-air satellite tv channels are also usually distributed on fss satellites in the k band the intelsat americas 5 galaxy 10r and amc 3 satellites over north america provide a quite large amount of fta channels on their k band transponders.nthe american dish network dbs service has also recently used fss technology as well for their programming packages requiring their superdish antenna due to dish network needing more capacity to carry local television stations per the fccs must-carry regulations and for more bandwidth to carry hdtv channels.na direct broadcast satellite is a communications satellite that transmits to small dbs satellite dishes usually 18 to 24 inches or 45 to 60 cm in diameter direct broadcast satellites generally operate in the upper portion of the microwave k band dbs technology is used for dth-oriented direct-to-home satellite tv services such as directv and dish network in the united states bell tv and shaw direct in canada freesat and sky in the uk ireland and new zealand and dstv in south africa.noperating at lower frequency and lower power than dbs fss satellites require a much larger dish for reception 3 to 8 feet 1 to 2.5 m in diameter for k band and 12 feet 3.6 m or larger for c band they use linear polarization for each of the transponders rf input and output as opposed to circular polarization used by dbs satellites but this is a minor technical difference that users do not notice fss satellite technology was also originally used for dth satellite tv from the late 1970s to the early 1990s in the united states in the form of tvro television receive only receivers and dishes it was also used in its k band form for the now-defunct primestar satellite tv service.nsome satellites have been launched that have transponders in the k band such as directvs spaceway-1 satellite and anik f2 nasa and isro have also launched experimental satellites carrying k band beacons recently.nsome manufacturers have also introduced special antennas for mobile reception of dbs television using global positioning system gps technology as a reference these antennas automatically re-aim to the satellite no matter where or how the vehicle on which the antenna is mounted is situated these mobile satellite antennas are popular with some recreational vehicle owners such mobile dbs antennas are also used by jetblue airways for directv supplied by livetv a subsidiary of jetblue which passengers can view on-board on lcd screens mounted in the seats.nnradio broadcastingeditnmain article satellite radionsatellite radio offers audio broadcast services in some countries notably the united states mobile services allow listeners to roam a continent listening to the same audio programming anywhere.na satellite radio or subscription radio sr is a digital radio signal that is broadcast by a communications satellite which covers a much wider geographical range than terrestrial radio signals.nsatellite radio offers a meaningful alternative to ground-based radio services in some countries notably the united states mobile services such as siriusxm and worldspace allow listeners to roam across an entire continent listening to the same audio programming anywhere they go other services such as music choice or muzaks satellite-delivered content require a fixed-location receiver and a dish antenna in all cases the antenna must have a clear view to the satellites in areas where tall buildings bridges or even parking garages obscure the signal repeaters can be placed to make the signal available to listeners.ninitially available for broadcast to stationary tv receivers by 2004 popular mobile direct broadcast applications made their appearance with the arrival of two satellite radio systems in the united states sirius and xm satellite radio holdings later they merged to become the conglomerate siriusxm.nradio services are usually provided by commercial ventures and are subscription-based the various services are proprietary signals requiring specialized hardware for decoding and playback providers usually carry a variety of news weather sports and music channels with the music channels generally being commercial-free.nin areas with a relatively high population density it is easier and less expensive to reach the bulk of the population with terrestrial broadcasts thus in the uk and some other countries the contemporary evolution of radio services is focused on digital audio broadcasting dab services or hd radio rather than satellite radio.nnamateur radioeditnmain article amateur radio satellitenamateur radio operators have access to amateur satellites which have been designed specifically to carry amateur radio traffic most such satellites operate as spaceborne repeaters and are generally accessed by amateurs equipped with uhf or vhf radio equipment and highly directional antennas such as yagis or dish antennas due to launch costs most current amateur satellites are launched into fairly low earth orbits and are designed to deal with only a limited number of brief contacts at any given time some satellites also provide data-forwarding services using the x.25 or similar protocols.nninternet accesseditnmain article satellite internet accessnafter the 1990s satellite communication technology has been used as a means to connect to the internet via broadband data connections this can be very useful for users who are located in remote areas and cannot access a broadband connection or require high availability of services.nnmilitaryeditncommunications satellites are used for military communications applications such as global command and control systems examples of military systems that use communication satellites are the milstar the dscs and the fltsatcom of the united states nato satellites united kingdom satellites for instance skynet and satellites of the former soviet union india has launched its first military communication satellite gsat-7 its transponders operate in uhf f c and k band bands
