blue origin wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnnnblue origin llc is an american privately funded aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight services company headquartered in kent washington founded in 2000 by jeff bezos the company is developing technologies to enable private human access to space with the goal to dramatically lower costs and increase reliability blue origin is employing an incremental approach from suborbital to orbital flight with each developmental step building on its prior work the company motto is gradatim ferociter latin for step by step ferociously".nblue origin is developing a variety of technologies with a focus on rocket-powered vertical takeoff and vertical landing vtvl vehicles for access to suborbital and orbital space the companys name refers to the blue planet earth as the point of origin.ninitially focused on suborbital spaceflight the company has designed built and flown multiple testbeds of its new shepard spacecraft at its facilities in culberson county texas developmental test flights of the new shepard named after the first american in space alan shepard began in april 2015 and flight testing continued into 2018 with its first passenger-carrying spaceflight planned for 2019.non nearly every one of the test flights since 2015 the uncrewed vehicle has reached a test altitude of more than 100 km 330,000 ft and achieved a top speed of more than mach 3 3,675 km/h 2,284 mph reaching space above the krmn line with both the space capsule and its rocket booster successfully soft landing making reuse possible by 2016 the second new shepard booster test article had made four flights each time exceeding 100 km 330,000 ft in altitude before returning for successful soft landings.nblue origin has become a part of a dramatic metamorphosis of the space industry in recent years nhaving moved into the orbital spaceflight technology business in 2014 initially as a rocket engine supplier for others via a contractual agreement to build a new large rocket engine the be-4 for major us launch system operator united launch alliance ula ula is also considering the be-3 blue origins smaller rocket engine used on new shepard for use in a new second stagethe advanced cryogenic evolved stage aceswhich will become the primary upper stage for ulas vulcan orbital launch vehicle in the 2020s.nby 2015 blue origin had announced plans to also manufacture and fly its own orbital launch vehicle from the florida space coast known as the new glenn be-4 had been expected to complete engine qualification testing by late 2018 but the test program continued into 2019.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditn blue origins three vehicles as of late 2012 1 goddard subscale demonstrator flight tested in 20062007 2 early subscale version of the suborbital new shepard propulsion module as flown in 2011 variations exist to the larger new shepard that actually flew in 2015 3 future space vehicle on top of a future orbital launch vehicle which when stacked is blue origins future orbital transportation system.nblue origin founder jeff bezos had been interested in space from an early age a profile published in 2013 described a 1982 miami herald interview bezos gave after he was named valedictorian of his high school class the 18-year-old bezos said he wanted to build space hotels amusement parks and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit the whole idea is to preserve the earth he told the newspaper the goal was to be able to evacuate humans the planet would become a park."nin 1999 after watching the rocketry biopic film october sky bezos discussed with science-fiction author neal stephenson the idea of forming a space company blue origin was founded in 2000 in kent washington and began developing both rocket propulsion systems and launch vehicles.nsince the founding the company was very secretive about its plans and emerged from its self-imposed silence only after 2015.nwhile the company was formally incorporated in 2000 its existence became public only in 2003 when bezos began buying land in texas and interested parties followed up on the purchases this was a topic of some interest in local politics and bezos rapid aggregation of lots under a variety of whimsically named shell companies was called a land grab".nfrom 2003 to 2017 blue origin was led by its president rob meyerson now senior vice president meyerson leads the advanced development program business.nin july 2013 the company employed approximately 250 people by may 2015 they had grown to approximately 400 employees with 350 of those working on engineering manufacturing and business operations in the kent location and approximately 50 in texas supporting the engine-test and suborbital test-flight facility.nby april 2017 the company had more than 1000 employees in august 2018 the company was more than 1500 employees more than double the number in early 2016 and is expected to double again by the time new glenn is flying."nas of 2016 blue origin was spending us$1 billion a year funded by jeff bezos sales of amazon stock in both 2017 and again in 2018 bezos made public statements that he intends to fund blue origin with us$1 billion per year from sales of his equity in amazon.nnnew shepardeditnmain article new shepardn company logo 2015nas early as 2005 bezos had discussed plans to create a vertical-takeoff and landing spaceship called new shepard plans for new shepard were initially kept quiet but blue origins website indicated bezos desire to lower the cost of spaceflight so that we humans can better continue exploring the solar system by 2008 a publicized timetable for new shepard indicated that blue origin intended to fly unmanned in 2011 and manned in 2012 in a 2011 interview bezos indicated that he founded blue origin to send customers into space by focusing on two objectives to decrease the cost and to increase the safety of human spaceflight.nby july 2014 bezos had invested over us$500 million of his own money into blue origin the first developmental test flight of the new shepard occurred on april 29 2015 the uncrewed vehicle flew to its planned test altitude of more than 93.5 km 307,000 ft and achieved a top speed of mach 3 3,675 km/h 2,284 mph in july 2015 nanoracks a provider of services such as payload design and development safety approvals and integration announced a partnership with blue origin to provide standardized payload accommodations for experiments flying on blue origins new shepard suborbital vehicle as of late 2016 blue origin projected that if all test flights operate as scheduled they could begin flying passengers to space on the new shepard in 2018.nin september 2014 the company and united launch alliance ula entered into a partnership whereby blue origin would produce a large rocket enginethe be-4for the vulcan the successor to the 10,00019,000-kilogram-class 22,00042,000 lb atlas v which has launched us national security payloads since the early 2000s and will exit service in the late 2010s the 2014 announcement added that blue origin had been working on the engine for three years prior to the public announcement and that the first flight on the new rocket could occur as early as 2019.nby april 2017 development and test of the 2,400 kn 550,000 lbf be-4 were progressing well and blue origin was expected to be selected for the ula vulcan rocket in april 2015 blue origin announced that it had completed acceptance testing of the be-3 rocket engine that would power the new shepard space capsule to be used for blue origin suborbital flights.non november 23 2015 blue origin launched the new shepard rocket to space for a second time to an altitude of 100.53 km 329,839 ft and vertically landed the rocket booster less than 1.5 metres 5 ft from the center of the pad the capsule descended to the ground under parachutes 11 minutes after blasting off and landed safely this was the first time a suborbital booster had flown to space and returned to earth n this flight validated the vehicle architecture and design the ring fin shifted the center of pressure aft to help control reentry and descent eight large drag brakes deployed and reduced the vehicles terminal speed to 623 km/h 387 mph hydraulically actuated fins steered the vehicle through 192 km/h 119 mph high-altitude crosswinds to a location precisely aligned with and 1,500 m 5,000 ft above the landing pad then the highly throttleable be-3 engine re-ignited to slow the booster as the landing gear deployed and the vehicle descended the last 30 m 100 ft at 7.1 km/h 4.4 mph to touchdown on the pad.non january 22 2016 blue origin re-flew the same new shepard booster that launched and landed vertically in november 2015 demonstrating reuse this time new shepard reached an apogee of 101.7 km 333,582 ft before both capsule and booster returned to earth for recovery and reuse on april 2 2016 the same new shepard booster again flew now for a third time reaching 103.4 km 339,178 ft before again returning successfully.nin september 2015 blue origin announced details of an unnamed planned orbital launch vehicle indicating that the first stage would be powered by its be-4 rocket engine currently under development while the second stage would be powered by its recently completed be-3 rocket engine in addition blue origin announced that it would both manufacture and launch the new rocket from the florida space coast no payload or gross launch weight was given bezos noted in interviews that this new launch vehicle would not compete for us government national security missions leaving that market to united launch alliance and spacex science-fiction author neal stephenson worked part-time at blue origin into late 2006 and credited the companys employees for ideas and discussions leading to his 2015 novel seveneves.nin march 2016 blue origin invited journalists to see the inside of its kent washington headquarters and manufacturing facility for the first time the company is planning for substantial growth in 2016 as it builds more crew capsules and propulsion modules for the new shepard program and ramps up be-4 engine builds to support full-scale development testing employment is expected to grow to 1,000 in 2016 from 600 in february nbezos also articulated a long-term vision for humans in space seeing the potential to move much heavy industry completely off-earth leaving our planet zoned strictly for residential and light industrial use with an end state hundreds of years out where millions of people would be living and working in space by march 2016 manned test flights were planned to take place by 2017 with possible commercial service in 2018.nalso in march 2016 bezos discussed his plans to offer space tourism services to space pointing out the entertainment aspect of the early barnstormers in really advancing aviation in the early days when such rides were a big fraction of airplane flights in those early days he sees space tourism playing a similar role advancing space travel and rocket launches through tourism and entertainment."non the other hand there are no current plans to pursue the niche market of us military launches bezos has said he is unsure where blue origin would add any value in that market.nin june 2018 blue origin indicated that while it continued to plan to fly initial internal passengers later in 2018 it would not be selling commercial tickets for new shepard until 2019.nnnew glenneditnmain article new glennnon september 12 2016

for shared and non-exclusive use of the lc39a complex such that the launchpad was to have been able to interface with multiple vehicles and costs for using the launch pad were to have been shared across multiple companies over the term of the lease one potential shared user in the blue origin notional plan was united launch alliance.na competing bid for commercial use of the lc39a launch complex was submitted by spacex which submitted a bid for exclusive use of the launch complex to support their crewed missions.nin september 2013before completion of the bid period and before any public announcement by nasa of the results of the processblue origin filed a protest with the u.s general accounting office gao over what it says is a plan by nasa to award an exclusive commercial lease to spacex for use of mothballed space shuttle launch pad 39a nasa had planned to complete the bid award and have the pad transferred by october 1 2013 but the protest will delay any decision until the gao reaches a decision expected by mid-december".nspacex said that they would be willing to support a multi-user arrangement for pad 39a.nin december 2013 the gao denied the blue origin protest and sided with nasa which argued that the solicitation contained no preference on the use of the facility as either multi-use or single-use the solicitation document merely asked bidders to explain their reasons for selecting one approach instead of the other and how they would manage the facility."nin the event nasa selected the spacex proposal in late 2013 and signed a 20-year lease
