household was a portuguese explorer he sailed around the southernmost tip of africa in 1488 the first to do so setting up the route from europe to asia later on dias is the first european during the age of discovery to anchor at what is present-day south africa.nncontentsnnnhistorical setting and purposes of the dias expeditioneditnbartolomeu dias was a squire of the royal court superintendent of the royal warehouses and sailing-master of the man-of-war so cristvo saint christopher very little is known of his early life king john ii of portugal appointed him on 10 october 1486 to head an expedition to sail around the southern tip of africa in the hope of finding a trade route to india dias was also charged with searching for the lands ruled by prester john a fabled christian priest and ruler of a territory somewhere beyond europe he left 10 months later in august 1487 in the previous decades portuguese mariners most famously prince henry the navigator whose contribution was more as a patron and sponsor of voyages of discovery than as a sailor had explored the areas of the atlantic ocean off southern europe and western africa as far as the cape verde islands and modern day sierra leone and had gained sufficient knowledge of oceanic shipping and wind patterns to enable subsequent voyages of greater distance in the early 1480s diogo co in two voyages he died towards the end of the second had explored the mouth of the congo river and sailed south of the equator to present-day angola and namibia.nnthe journeyeditnso cristvo was piloted by pro de alenquer a second caravel the so pantaleo was commanded by joo infante and piloted by lvaro martins dias brother pro dias was the captain of the square-rigged support ship with joo de santiago as pilot.nn an illustration of the so cristvo and so pantaleonthe expedition sailed around the west coast of africa and more provisions were picked up on the way at the portuguese fortress of so jorge de mina on the gold coast after having sailed south of modern day angola dias reached the golfo da conceico walvis bay in modern namibia by december continuing south he discovered first angra dos ilheus being hit then by a violent storm thirteen days later from the open ocean he searched the coast again to the east discovering and using the westerlies winds the ocean gyre but finding just ocean having rounded the cape of good hope at a considerable distance to the west and southwest he turned towards the east and taking advantage of the winds of antarctica that blow strongly in the south atlantic he sailed northeast after 30 days without seeing land he entered what he named aguada de so brs bay of saint blaiselater renamed mossel bayon 4 february 1488 diass expedition reached its furthest point on 12 march 1488 when they anchored at kwaaihoek near the mouth of the boesmans river where a padrothe padro de so gregriowas erected before turning back dias wanted to continue sailing to india but he was forced to turn back when his crew refused to go further and the rest of the officers unanimously favoured returning to portugal it was only on the return voyage that he actually discovered the cape of good hope in may 1488 dias returned to lisbon in december of that year after an absence of sixteen months and seventeen days.nthe discovery of the passage around southern africa was significant because for the first time europeans could trade directly with india and the far east bypassing the overland euro-asian route with its expensive european middle eastern and central asian middlemen.the official report of the expedition has been lost.nbartolomeu dias originally named the cape of good hope the cape of storms cabo das tormentas it was later renamed by king john ii of portugal the cape of good hope cabo da boa esperana because it represented the opening of a route to the east.nnfollow-up voyageseditnafter these early attempts the portuguese took a decade-long break from indian ocean exploration during that hiatus it is likely that they received valuable information from a secret agent pro da covilh who had been sent overland to india and returned with reports useful to their navigators.nusing his experience with explorative travel dias helped in the construction of the so gabriel and its sister ship the so rafael that were used in 1498 by vasco da gama to sail past the cape of good hope and continue to india dias only participated in the first leg of da gamas voyage until the cape verde islands two years later he was one of the captains of the second indian expedition headed by pedro lvares cabral this flotilla first reached the coast of brazil landing there in 1500 and then continued eastwards to india dias perished near the cape of good hope that he presciently had named cape of storms four ships encountered a huge storm off the cape and were lost including dias on 29 may 1500 a shipwreck found in 2008 by the namdeb diamond corporation off namibia was at first thought to be dias ship however recovered coins come from a later time.nnpersonal lifeeditnbartolomeu dias was married and had two children:nnnsee
