celestial sphere wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnot to be confused with the celestial spheres of cosmological models in antiquity for other uses see celestial disambiguation.n earth rotating within a relatively small-radius geocentric celestial sphere shown here are stars white the ecliptic red the circumscription of the suns apparent annual track and the lines of right ascension and circles of declination cyan of the equatorial coordinate system.nin astronomy and navigation the celestial sphere is an abstract sphere that has an arbitrarily large radius and is concentric to earth all objects in the sky can be conceived as being projected upon the inner surface of the celestial sphere which may be centered on earth or the observer if centered on the observer half of the sphere would resemble a hemispherical screen over the observing location.nthe celestial sphere is a practical tool for spherical astronomy allowing astronomers to specify the apparent positions of objects in the sky if their distances are unknown or irrelevant in the equatorial coordinate system the celestial equator divides the celestial sphere into two halves the northern and southern celestial hemispheres.nncontentsnnnintroductioneditn celestial sphere 18th century brooklyn museum.nbecause astronomical objects are at such remote distances casual observation of the sky offers no information on their actual distances all celestial objects seem equally far away as if fixed onto the inside of a sphere with a large but unknown radius nwhich appears to rotate westward overhead meanwhile earth underfoot seems to remain still for purposes of spherical astronomy which is concerned only with the directions to celestial objects it makes no difference if this is actually the case or if it is earth that is rotating while the celestial sphere is stationary.nthe celestial sphere can be considered to be infinite in radius this means any point within it including that occupied by the observer can be considered the center it also means that all parallel lines be they millimetres apart or across the solar system from each other will seem to intersect the sphere at a single point analogous to the vanishing point of graphical perspective nall parallel planes will seem to intersect the sphere in a coincident great circle na vanishing circle".nconversely observers looking toward the same point on an infinite-radius celestial sphere will be looking along parallel lines and observers looking toward the same great circle along parallel planes on an infinite-radius celestial sphere all observers see the same things in the same direction.nfor some objects this is over-simplified objects which are relatively near to the observer for instance the moon will seem to change position against the distant celestial sphere if the observer moves far enough say from one side of planet earth to the other this effect known as parallax can be represented as a small offset from a mean position the celestial sphere can be considered to be centered at the earths center the suns center or any other convenient location and offsets from positions referred to these centers can be calculated.nin this way astronomers can predict geocentric or heliocentric positions of objects on the celestial sphere without the need to calculate the individual geometry of any particular observer and the utility of the celestial sphere is maintained individual observers can work out their own small offsets from the mean positions if necessary in many cases in astronomy the offsets are insignificant.nthe celestial sphere can thus be thought of as a kind of astronomical shorthand and is applied very frequently by astronomers for instance the astronomical almanac for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the moon on january 1 at 00:00:00.00 terrestrial time in equatorial coordinates as right ascension 6 57 48.86 declination 23 30 05.5 implied in this position is that it is as projected onto the celestial sphere any observer at any location looking in that direction would see the geocentric moon in the same place against the stars for many rough uses e.g calculating an approximate phase of the moon this position as seen from the earths center is adequate.nfor applications requiring precision e.g calculating the shadow path of an eclipse the almanac gives formulae and methods for calculating the topocentric coordinates that is as seen from a particular place on the earths surface based on the geocentric position this greatly abbreviates the amount of detail necessary in such almanacs as each observer can handle their own specific circumstances.nncelestial coordinate systemseditnthese concepts are important for understanding celestial coordinate systems frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky certain reference lines and planes on earth when projected onto the celestial sphere form the bases of the reference systems these include the earths equator axis and orbit at their intersections with the celestial sphere these form the celestial equator the north and south celestial poles and the ecliptic respectively as the celestial sphere is considered arbitrary or infinite in radius all observers see the celestial equator celestial poles and ecliptic at the same place against the background stars.nfrom these bases directions toward objects in the sky can be quantified by constructing celestial coordinate systems similar to geographic longitude and latitude the equatorial coordinate system specifies positions relative to the celestial equator and celestial poles using right ascension and declination the ecliptic coordinate system specifies positions relative to the ecliptic earths orbit using ecliptic longitude and latitude besides the equatorial and ecliptic systems some other celestial coordinate systems like the galactic coordinate system are more appropriate for particular purposes.nnhistoryeditnmain article history of astronomynthe ancients assumed the literal truth of stars attached to a celestial sphere revolving about the earth in one day and a fixed earth nthe eudoxan planetary model on which the aristotelian and ptolemaic models were based was the first geometric explanation for the wandering of the classical planets the outer most of these crystal spheres was thought to carry the fixed stars eudoxus used 27 concentric spherical solids to answer platos challenge by the assumption of what uniform and orderly motions can the apparent motions of the planets be accounted for?"nnstar globeeditn celestial globe by jost brgi 1594nmain articles star chart armillary sphere and celestial globena celestial sphere can also refer to a physical model of the celestial sphere or celestial globe.nsuch globes map the constellations on the outside of a sphere resulting in a mirror image of the constellations as seen from earth the oldest surviving example of such an artifact is the globe of the farnese atlas sculpture a 2nd-century copy of an older hellenistic period ca 120 bce work.nnbodies other than eartheditnsee also international celestial reference systemnobservers on other worlds would of course see objects in that sky under much the same conditions as if projected onto a dome coordinate systems based on the sky of that world could be constructed these could be based on the equivalent ecliptic poles and equator although the reasons for building a system that way are as much historic as technical.nnsee alsoeditnnnnnoteseditnnnreferenceseditnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn
