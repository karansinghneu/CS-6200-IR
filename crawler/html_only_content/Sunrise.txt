sunrise wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnfor other uses see sunrise disambiguation.nnot to be confused with sunset or dawn.n hazy summer sunrise over the mojave desertn nsunrise or sun up is the moment when the upper limb of the sun appears on the horizon in the morning the term can also refer to the entire process of the solar disk crossing the horizon and its accompanying atmospheric effects.nncontentsnnnterminologyeditn"rise"editnalthough the sun appears to rise from the horizon it is actually the earths motion that causes the sun to appear the illusion of a moving sun results from earth observers being in a rotating reference frame this apparent motion is so convincing that most cultures had mythologies and religions built around the geocentric model which prevailed until astronomer nicolaus copernicus first formulated the heliocentric model in the 16th century.narchitect buckminster fuller proposed the terms sunsight and sunclipse to better represent the heliocentric model though the terms have not entered into common language.nnbeginning and endeditnastronomically sunrise occurs for only an instant the moment at which the upper limb of the sun appears tangent to the horizon however the term sunrise commonly refers to periods of time both before and after this point:nnnmeasurementeditn this diagram of the sun at sunrise or sunset shows the effects of atmospheric refraction.nangleeditnsunrise actually occurs before the sun truly reaches the horizon because earths atmosphere refracts the suns image at the horizon the average amount of refraction is 34 arcminutes though this amount varies based on atmospheric conditions.nalso unlike most other solar measurements sunrise occurs when the suns upper limb rather than its center appears to cross the horizon the apparent radius of the sun at the horizon is 16 arcminutes.nthese two angles combine to define sunrise to occur when the suns center is 50 arcminutes below the horizon or 90.83 from the zenith.nntime of dayeditnthe timing of sunrise varies throughout the year and is also affected by the viewers longitude and latitude altitude and time zone these changes are driven by the axial tilt of earth daily rotation of the earth the planets movement in its annual elliptical orbit around the sun and the earth and moons paired revolutions around each other the analemma can be used to make approximate predictions of the time of sunrise.nn time of sunrise in 2008 for libreville gabon near the equator the variation of the time of sunrise is mainly governed by the variation of the equation of time see here for the sunrise chart of a different location.nin late winter and spring sunrise as seen from temperate latitudes occurs earlier each day reaching its earliest time near the summer solstice although the exact date varies by latitude after this point the time of sunrise gets later each day reaching its latest sometime around the winter solstice the offset between the dates of the solstice and the earliest or latest sunrise time is caused by the eccentricity of earths orbit and the tilt of its axis and is described by the analemma which can be used to predict the dates.nvariations in atmospheric refraction can alter the time of sunrise by changing its apparent position near the poles the time-of-day variation is exaggerated since the sun crosses the horizon at a very shallow angle and thus rises more slowly.naccounting for atmospheric refraction and measuring from the leading edge slightly increases the average duration of day relative to night the sunrise equation however which is used to derive the time of sunrise and sunset uses the suns physical center for calculation neglecting atmospheric refraction and the non-zero angle subtended by the solar disc.nnlocation on the horizoneditnneglecting the effects of refraction and the suns non-zero size whenever sunrise occurs in temperate regions it is always in the northeast quadrant from the march equinox to the september equinox and in the southeast quadrant from the september equinox to the march equinox sunrises occur approximately due east on the march and september equinoxes for all viewers on earth exact calculations of the azimuths of sunrise on other dates are complex but they can be estimated with reasonable accuracy by using the analemma.nnnappearanceeditn early december

and mie scattering.nas a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to an observer some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles changing the final color of the beam the viewer sees.nbecause the shorter wavelength components such as blue and green scatter more strongly,nthese colors are preferentially removed from the beam.nat sunrise and sunset when the path through the atmosphere is longer the blue and green components are removed almost completely leaving the longer wavelength orange and red hues seen at those times the remaining reddened sunlight can then be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles to light up the horizon red and orange the removal of the shorter wavelengths of light is due to rayleigh scattering by air molecules and particles much smaller than the wavelength of visible light less than 50 nm in diameter the scattering by cloud droplets and other particles with diameters comparable to or larger than the sunlights wavelengths more than 600 nm is due to mie scattering and is not strongly wavelength-dependent mie scattering is responsible for the light scattered by clouds and also for the daytime halo of white light around the sun forward scattering of white light.nsunset colors are typically more brilliant than sunrise colors because the evening air contains more particles than morning air.nn peach sunrise over the sea sydney australianash from volcanic eruptions trapped within the troposphere tends to mute sunset and sunrise colors while volcanic ejecta that is instead lofted into the stratosphere as thin clouds of tiny sulfuric acid droplets can yield beautiful post-sunset colors called afterglows and pre-sunrise glows a number of eruptions including those of mount pinatubo in 1991 and krakatoa in 1883 have produced sufficiently high stratospheric sulfuric acid clouds to yield remarkable sunset afterglows and pre-sunrise glows around the world the high altitude clouds serve to reflect strongly reddened sunlight still striking the stratosphere after sunset down to the surface.nnoptical illusions and other phenomenaeditn this is a false sunrise a very
