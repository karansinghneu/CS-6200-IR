parker solar probe wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnnnparker solar probe previously solar probe solar probe plus or solar probe abbreviated psp is a nasa robotic spacecraft launched in 2018 and currently en route to probe the outer corona of the sun it will approach to within 9.86 solar radii 6.9 million kilometers or 4.3 million miles from the center of the sun and by 2025 will travel at closest approach as fast as 690,000 km/h 430,000 mph or 0.064 the speed of light.nthe project was announced in the fiscal 2009 budget year the cost of the project is us$1.5 billion johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory designed and built the spacecraft which was launched on august 12 2018 it became the first nasa spacecraft named after a living person honoring physicist eugene parker professor emeritus at the university of chicago.na memory card containing the names of over 1.1 million people was mounted on a plaque and installed below the spacecrafts high-gain antenna on may 18 2018 the card also contains photos of parker and a copy of his 1958 scientific paper predicting important aspects of solar physics.non 29 october 2018 at about 1:04 p.m edt the spacecraft became the closest ever man-made object to the sun the previous record 26.55 million miles from the suns surface was set by the helios 2 spacecraft in april 1976.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditn light bar testing in the astrotech processing facilitynplay media launch of the probenthe parker solar probe concept originates from a predecessor solar orbiter project conceived in the 1990s similar in design and objectives the solar probe mission served as one of the centerpieces of the eponymous outer planet/solar probe opsp program formulated by nasa the first three missions of the program were planned to be the solar orbiter the pluto and kuiper belt reconnaissance mission pluto kuiper express and the europa orbiter astrobiology mission focused on europa.nthe original solar probe design used a gravity assist from jupiter to enter a polar orbit which dropped almost directly toward the sun while this explored the important solar poles and came even closer to the surface 3 r a perihelion of 4 r the extreme variation in solar irradiance made for an expensive mission and required a radioisotope thermal generator for power the trip to jupiter also made for a long mission 3 years to first solar perihelion 8 years to second.nfollowing the appointment of sean okeefe as administrator of nasa the entirety of the opsp program was canceled as part of president george w bushs request for the 2003 united states federal budget administrator okeefe cited a need for a restructuring of nasa and its projects falling in line with the bush administrations wish for nasa to refocus on research and development and addressing management shortcomings."nthe cancellation of the program also resulted in the initial cancellation of new horizons the mission that eventually won the competition to replace pluto kuiper express in the former opsp program that mission which would eventually be launched as the first mission of the new frontiers program a conceptual successor to the opsp program would undergo a lengthy political battle to secure funding for its launch which occurred in 2006.nin the early 2010s plans for the solar probe mission were incorporated into a lower-cost solar probe plus the redesigned mission uses multiple venus gravity assists for a more direct flight path which can be powered by solar panels it also has a higher perihelion reducing the demands on the thermal protection system.nin may 2017 the spacecraft was renamed parker solar probe in honor of astrophysicist eugene parker coiner of the term solar wind the solar probe cost nasa us$1.5 billion the launch rocket bore a dedication in memory of apl engineer andrew a dantzler who had worked on the project.nnspacecrafteditnplay media nasas parker solar probe during extensive environmental testingnthe parker solar probe will be the first spacecraft to fly into the low solar corona it will assess the structure and dynamics of the suns coronal plasma and magnetic field the energy flow that heats the solar corona and impels the solar wind and the mechanisms that accelerate energetic particles.nthe spacecrafts systems are protected from the extreme heat and radiation near the sun by a solar shield incident solar radiation at perihelion is approximately 7005650000000000000650 kw/m or 475 times the intensity at earth orbit the solar shield is hexagonal mounted on the sun-facing side of the spacecraft 2.3 m 7.5 ft in diameter 11.4 cm 4.5 in thick and is made of reinforced carboncarbon composite which is designed to withstand temperatures outside the spacecraft of about 1,370 c 2,500 f a white reflective alumina surface layer minimizes absorption the spacecraft systems and scientific instruments are located in the central portion of the shields shadow where direct radiation from the sun is fully blocked if the shield were not between the spacecraft and the sun the probe would be damaged and become inoperative within tens of seconds as radio communication with earth will take about eight minutes the parker solar probe will have to act autonomously and rapidly to protect itself this will be done using four light sensors to detect the first traces of direct sun light coming from the shield limits and engaging movements from fly wheels to reposition the spacecraft within the shadow again according to project scientist nicky fox the team describe it as the most autonomous spacecraft that has ever flown".nthe primary power for the mission is a dual system of solar panels photovoltaic arrays a primary photovoltaic array used for the portion of the mission outside 70103739946767500000.25 au is retracted behind the shadow shield during the close approach to the sun and a much smaller secondary array powers the spacecraft through closest approach this secondary array uses pumped-fluid cooling to maintain operating temperature of the solar panels and instrumentation.nntrajectoryeditn animation of parker solar probes trajectory from august 7 2018 to august 29 2025 parker solar probe sun mercury venus earthfor more detailed animation see this video.n second flyby of venus on december 26 2019 the velocity decreases by 2.9 km/s to 26 km/s red circle shifting the spacecraft to a new orbit closer to the sun.nthe parker solar probe mission design uses repeated gravity assists at venus to incrementally decrease its orbital perihelion to achieve a final altitude above the surface of approximately 8.5 solar radii or about 610 km 3.710 mi 0.040 au the spacecraft trajectory will include seven venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its elliptical orbit around the sun for a total of 24 orbits the near sun radiation environment is predicted to cause spacecraft charging effects radiation damage in materials and electronics and communication interruptions so the orbit will be highly elliptical with short times spent near the sun.nthe trajectory requires high launch energy so the probe was launched on a delta iv heavy class launch vehicle and an upper stage based on the star 48bv solid rocket motor interplanetary gravity assists will provide further deceleration relative to its heliocentric orbit which will result in a heliocentric speed record at perihelion as the probe passes around the sun it will achieve a velocity of up to 200 km/s 120 mi/s which will temporarily make it the fastest manmade object almost three times as fast as the current record holder helios-b like every object in an orbit due to gravity the spacecraft will accelerate as it nears perihelion then slow down again afterward until it reaches its aphelion.nnmissioneditnwithin each orbit of the parker solar probe around the sun the portion within 0.25 au will be the science phase in which the probe will be actively and autonomously making observations communication with the probe will be largely cut off in that phase these science phases will run for a few days both before and after each perihelion they will last 11.6 days for the earliest perihelion and drop to 9.6 days for the final closest perihelion.nmuch of the rest of each orbit will be devoted to transmitting data from the science observation and measurement phase but during this part of each orbit there will still be periods when communication is impeded or not possible first the heat shield of the probe must be pointed towards the sun there will be times when that will put the heat shield between the antenna and earth secondly even when the probe is not particularly near the sun when the angle between the probe and the sun as seen from earth is too small the suns radiation will overwhelm the communication link.nnscience goalseditn apparent size of the sun as seen from the orbit of the parker solar probe compared to its apparent size seen from earth.nthe goals of the mission are:nnninvestigationseditnto achieve these goals the mission will perform five major experiments or investigations:nnntimelineeditnafter the first venus flyby the probe will be in an elliptical orbit with a period of 150 days two-thirds the period of venus making three orbits while venus makes two on the second flyby the period shortens to 130 days after less than two orbits only 198 days later it encounters venus a third time at a point earlier in the orbit of venus this encounter shortens its period to half of that of venus or about 112.5 days after two orbits it meets venus a fourth time at about the same place shortening its period to about 102 days after 237 days it meets venus for the fifth time and its period is shortened to about 96 days three-sevenths that of venus it then makes seven orbits while venus makes three the sixth encounter almost two years after the fifth brings its period down to 92 days two-fifths that of venus after five more orbits two orbits of venus it meets venus for the seventh and last time decreasing its period to 88 or 89 days and allowing it to approach closer to the sun.nnn speed of the probe and
