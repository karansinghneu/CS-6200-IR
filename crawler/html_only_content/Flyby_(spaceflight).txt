flyby spaceflight wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn imagery collected by voyager 2 of ganymede during its flyby of the jovian systemn galileo spacecraft encounters asteroid 243 idanflyby is a spacecraft concept whereby one object passes in closer proximity to another usually a spacecraft maneuver in space exploration spacecraft which are specifically designed for this purpose are known as flyby spacecraft although the term has also been used in regard to asteroid flybys of earth for example two common goals are for exploration or for a gravity assist.none important subconcept of a flyby in spaceflight is the time and distance of closest approach this distance is often reported along with a time in regards to flybys in space.nncontentsnnnspacecraft flybyeditnflyby maneuvers can be conducted with a planet or non-planet object such as a comet.nplanetary flybys have occurred with mars or earth for example:nnnan example of a comet flyby is when international cometary explorer formerly isee-3 passed about 4800 miles 7,800 kilometers from the nucleus of comet giacobini-zinner in september 1985.nanother application of the flyby is of earths moon usually called a lunar flyby.nthe orion em-2 mission has a mission design that would include a lunar flyby.nn em-2 plan is to send 4 astronauts a total of 1,090,320km over 9 days around the moon but not enter lunar orbitnnn illustration of the marco 6u cubesat relay flyby probe and technology demonstrators for the mars insight lander the flyby provided bent pipe communication support during the landing in 2018nin regards to mars flybys a related concept is a mars flyby rendezvous where a spacecraft does not enter orbit but rendezvous before or after a flyby of the planet with another spacecraft mars flyby rendezvous was evaluated at nasas manned spacecraft center in the 1960s at that time nasa developed designs for a combination of a mars lander short-stay surface habitat and ascent vehicle called a mars excursion module mem the ascent stage performed the rendezvous with another spacecraft that did a flyby of mars without entering orbit or landing compared to mor a flyby rendezvous means one spacecraft does not have to orbit mars so the resources needed on a return journey to earth are not taken in and out of mars orbit for example see also mars cyclernmariner iv flyby of mars in july 1965 returned more accurate atmospheric data about mars and much closer views of its surface then previously.nmariner 6 and mariner 7 flyby of mars in 1969 caused another breakthrough in knowledge about the planet the mariner 6 7 infrared radiometer results from he flyby showed that the atmosphere of mars was composed mostly of carbon dioxide co and they were also able to detect trace amounts water on the surface of mars.nin 2018 the twin mars cube one performed a flyby to relay communication for insight lander edl they were launched towards mars with the cruise stage carrying the insight lander both marcos reached mars and successfully relayed data during the entry descent and landing phase of insight on november 26 2018.nnnthe new horizons spacecraft was planning to flyby the kuiper belt object 2014 mu69 on new years day 2019 after its successful flyby of the dwarf planet pluto in 2015.non the night of december 31 2018 to the morning of january 1 2019 new horizons performed the most distant flyby to date of the kuiper belt minor planet 486958 2014 mu69 new horizons previously did a flyby of pluto in july 2015 and that was at about 32.9 au astronomical units from the sun while the new years day 2019 flyby of the kuiper object ultima thule 2014 mu69 was at 43.6 au nn diagram of the trajectory of new horizons during its flyby of plutonnn

flybys of many of saturns moons including titan cassini-huygens had its first flyby of titan in october 2004 for further examples of cassini flybys of saturns moons see timeline of cassini-huygens.ncassini conducted many flybys at various distances of the moons of saturn it achieved 126 flybys of titan and its final close flyby was on april 22 2017 prior to its retirement.nanimation of the cassini spacecraft trajectory around saturn over 10 years and during this time it passed closely by many moons of saturn:nnnninternational cometary explorer isee-3 passed through the plasma tail of comet giacobini-zinner doing a flyby of the distance of 7,800 km 4,800 mi of the nucleus on september 11 1985.nin 2010 the deep impact spacecraft on the epoxi mission did a

describe when for example an asteroid approaches and coasts by the earth.nthis was also the term for when a comet did a flyby of mars in 2014.np/2016 ba14 was radar imaged at distance of 2.2 million miles 9 lunar distances from earth in 2016 during its flyby this enabled the size of the nucleus to be calculated to about 1 km in diameter.non december 16 2018 the short period comet 46p/wirtanen had
