the seleucid empire around 250 bc and became king diodotus i of bactria the preserved ancient sources see below are somewhat contradictory and the exact date of bactrian independence has not been settled somewhat simplified there is a high chronology c 255 bc and a low chronology c 246 bc for diodotos secession.nthe high chronology has the advantage of explaining why the seleucid king antiochus ii issued very few coins in bactria as diodotos would have become independent there early in antiochus reign on the other hand the low chronology from the mid-240s bc has the advantage of connecting the secession of diodotus i with the third syrian war a catastrophic conflict for the seleucid empire.nndiodotus the governor of the thousand cities of bactria latin theodotus mille urbium

and had to retreat he then successfully resisted a three-year siege in the fortified city of bactra modern balkh before antiochus finally decided to recognize the new ruler and to offer one of his daughters to euthydemuss son demetrius around 206 bc classical accounts also relate that euthydemus negotiated peace with antiochus iii by suggesting that he deserved credit for overthrowing the original rebel diodotus and that he was protecting central asia from nomadic invasions thanks to his defensive efforts:nn for if he did not yield to this demand neither of them would be safe seeing that great hordes of nomads were close at hand who were a danger to both and that if they admitted them into the country it would certainly be utterly barbarised polybius 11.34ngeographic

found in the artworks of the burial site of chinas first emperor qin shi huang dating back to the 3rd century bc including in the manufacture of the famous terracotta army this idea suggested that greek artists may have come to china at that time to train local artisans in making sculptures however this idea is disputed by chinese scholars.nnumismatics also suggest that some technology exchanges may have occurred on these occasions the greco-bactrians were the first in the world to issue cupro-nickel 75/25 ratio coins an alloy technology only known by the chinese at the time under the name white copper some weapons from the warring states period were in copper-nickel alloy the practice of exporting chinese metals in particular iron for trade is attested around that period kings euthydemus euthydemus ii agathocles and pantaleon made these coin issues around 170 bc and it has alternatively been suggested that a nickeliferous copper ore was the source from mines at anarak copper-nickel would not be used again in coinage until the 19th century.nthe presence of chinese people in india from ancient times is also suggested by the accounts of the cias in the mahabharata and the manu smriti the han dynasty explorer and ambassador zhang qian visited bactria in 126 bc and reported the presence of chinese products in the bactrian markets:nn"when i was in bactria daxia zhang qian reported i saw bamboo canes from qiong and cloth made in the province of shu territories of southwestern china when i asked the people how they had gotten such articles they replied our merchants

india interacting with the indian subcontinent and having a rich hellenistic culture was in a unique position to influence indian culture as well it is considered that ai-khanoum may have been one of the primary actors in transmitting western artistic influence to india for example in the creation of the pillars of ashoka or the manufacture of the quasi-ionic pataliputra capital all of which were posterior to the establishment of ai-khanoum.nthe scope of adoption goes from designs such as the bead and reel pattern the central flame palmette design and a variety of other moldings to the

pear-shaped case or conch and the sudarshana chakra wheel some other coins by agathocles are also thought to represent the buddhist lion and the indian goddess lakshmi consort of vishnu the indian coinage of agathocles is few but spectacular these coins at least demonstrate the readiness of greek kings to represent deities of foreign origin the dedication of a greek envoy to the cult of garuda
