tract digestive tract digestional tract gi tract git gut or alimentary canal is an organ system within humans and other animals which takes in food digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients and expels the remaining waste as feces the mouth esophagus stomach and intestines are part of the gastrointestinal tract gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines a tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs.nall bilaterians have a gastrointestinal tract also called a gut or an alimentary canal this is a tube that transfers food to the organs of digestion in large bilaterians the gastrointestinal tract also has an exit the anus by which the animal disposes of feces solid wastes some small bilaterians have no anus and dispose of solid wastes by other means for example through the mouth the human gastrointestinal tract consists of the esophagus stomach and intestines and is divided into the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts the gi tract includes all structures between the mouth and the anus forming a continuous passageway that includes the main organs of digestion namely the stomach small intestine and large intestine however the complete human digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal tract plus the accessory organs of digestion the tongue salivary glands pancreas liver and gallbladder the tract may also be divided into foregut midgut and hindgut reflecting the embryological origin of each segment the whole human gi tract is about nine metres 30 feet long at autopsy it is considerably shorter in the living body because the intestines which are tubes of smooth muscle tissue maintain constant muscle tone in a halfway-tense state but can relax in spots to allow for local distention and peristalsis.nthe gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of microbes with some 4,000 different strains of bacteria having diverse roles in maintenance of immune health and metabolism cells of the gi tract release hormones to help regulate the digestive process these digestive hormones including gastrin secretin cholecystokinin and ghrelin are mediated through either intracrine or autocrine mechanisms indicating that the cells releasing these hormones are conserved structures throughout evolution.nncontentsnnnhuman gastrointestinal tracteditnstructureeditn upper and lower human gastrointestinal tractn illustration of human gastrointestinal tractnthe structure and function can be described both as gross anatomy and as microscopic anatomy or histology the tract itself is divided into upper and lower tracts and the intestines small and large parts.nnupper gastrointestinal tracteditnmain articles esophagus stomach and duodenumnthe upper gastrointestinal tract consists of the mouth pharynx esophagus stomach and duodenum.nthe exact demarcation between the upper and lower tracts is the suspensory muscle of the duodenum this differentiates the embryonic borders between the foregut and midgut and is also the division commonly used by clinicians to describe gastrointestinal bleeding as being of either upper or lower origin upon dissection the duodenum may appear to be a unified organ but it is divided into four segments based upon function location and internal anatomy the four segments of the duodenum are as follows starting at the stomach and moving toward the jejunum bulb descending horizontal and ascending the suspensory muscle attaches the superior border of the ascending duodenum to the diaphragm.nthe suspensory muscle is an important anatomical landmark which shows the formal division between the duodenum and the jejunum the first and second parts of the small intestine respectively this is a thin muscle which is derived from the embryonic mesoderm.nnlower gastrointestinal tracteditnthe lower gastrointestinal tract includes most of the small intestine and all of the large intestine in human anatomy the intestine bowel or gut greek ntera is the segment of the gastrointestinal tract extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the anus and as in other mammals consists of two segments the small intestine and the large intestine in humans the small intestine is further subdivided into the duodenum jejunum and ileum while the large intestine is subdivided into the cecum ascending transverse descending and sigmoid colon rectum and anal canal.nnsmall intestineeditnmain article small intestinenthe small intestine begins at the duodenum and is a tubular structure usually between 6 and 7 m long its mucosal area in an adult human is about 30 m its main function is to absorb the products of digestion including carbohydrates proteins lipids and vitamins into the bloodstream there are three major divisions:nnnlarge intestineeditnmain article large intestinenthe large intestine also called the colon consists of the cecum rectum and anal canal it also includes the appendix which is attached to the cecum the colon is further divided into:nnnthe main function of the large intestine is to absorb water.nthe area of the large intestinal mucosa of an adult human is about 2 m.nndevelopmenteditnmain article development of the digestive systemnthe gut is an endoderm-derived structure at approximately the sixteenth day of human development the embryo begins to fold ventrally with the embryos ventral surface becoming concave in two directions the sides of the embryo fold in on each other and the head and tail fold toward one another the result is that a piece of the yolk sac an endoderm-lined structure in contact with the ventral aspect of the embryo begins to be pinched off to become the primitive gut the yolk sac remains connected to the gut tube via the vitelline duct usually this structure regresses during development in cases where it does not it is known as meckels diverticulum.nduring fetal life the primitive gut is gradually patterned into three segments foregut midgut and hindgut although these terms are often used in reference to segments of the primitive gut they are also used regularly to describe regions of the definitive gut as well.neach segment of the gut is further specified and gives rise to specific gut and gut-related structures in later development components derived from the gut proper including the stomach and colon develop as swellings or dilatations in the cells of the primitive gut in contrast gut-related derivatives that is those structures that derive from the primitive gut but are not part of the gut proper in general develop as out-pouchings of the primitive gut the blood vessels supplying these structures remain constant throughout development.nnnhistologyeditnmain article gastrointestinal walln general structure of the gut wall nthe gastrointestinal tract has a form of general histology with some differences that reflect the specialization in functional anatomy the gi tract can be divided into four concentric layers in the following order:nnnmucosaeditnsee also oral mucosa and gastric mucosanthe mucosa is the innermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract the mucosa surrounds the lumen or open space within the tube this layer comes in direct contact with digested food chyme the mucosa is made up of:nnnthe mucosae are highly specialized in each organ of the gastrointestinal tract to deal with the different conditions the most variation is seen in the epithelium.nnsubmucosaeditnmain article submucosanthe submucosa consists of a dense irregular layer of connective tissue with large blood vessels lymphatics and nerves branching into the mucosa and muscularis externa it contains the submucosal plexus an enteric nervous plexus situated on the inner surface of the muscularis externa.nnmuscular layereditnthe muscular layer consists of an inner circular layer and a longitudinal outer layer the circular layer prevents food from traveling backward and the longitudinal layer shortens the tract the layers are not truly longitudinal or circular rather the layers of muscle are helical with different pitches the inner circular is helical with a steep pitch and the outer longitudinal is helical with a much shallower pitch whilst the muscularis externa is similar throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract an exception is the stomach which has an additional inner oblique muscular layer to aid with grinding and mixing of food the muscularis externa of the stomach is composed of the inner oblique layer middle circular layer and outer longitudinal layer nbetween the circular and longitudinal muscle layers is the myenteric plexus this controls peristalsis activity is initiated by the pacemaker cells myenteric interstitial cells of cajal the gut has intrinsic peristaltic activity basal electrical rhythm due to its self-contained enteric nervous system the rate can be modulated by the rest of the autonomic nervous system.nthe coordinated contractions of these layers is called peristalsis and propels the food through the tract food in the gi tract is called a bolus ball of food from the mouth down to the stomach after the stomach the food is partially digested and semi-liquid and is referred to as chyme in the large intestine the remaining semi-solid substance is referred to as faeces.nnadventitia and serosaeditnmain articles serous membrane and adventitianthe outermost layer of the gastrointestinal tract consists of several layers of connective tissue.nintraperitoneal parts of the gi tract are covered with serosa these include most of the stomach first part of the duodenum all of the small intestine caecum and appendix transverse colon sigmoid colon and rectum in these sections of the gut there is clear boundary between the gut and the surrounding tissue these parts of the tract have a mesentery.nretroperitoneal parts are covered with adventitia they blend into the surrounding tissue and are fixed in position for example the retroperitoneal section of the duodenum usually passes through the transpyloric plane these include the esophagus pylorus of the stomach distal duodenum ascending colon descending colon and anal canal in addition the oral cavity has adventitia.nngene and protein expressioneditnapproximately 20,000 protein coding genes are expressed in human cells and 75 of these genes are expressed in at least one of the different parts of the digestive organ system over 600 of these genes are more specifically expressed in one or more parts of the gi tract and the corresponding proteins have functions related to digestion of food and uptake of nutrients examples of specific proteins with such functions are pepsinogen pgc and the lipase lipf expressed in chief cells and gastric atpase atp4a and gastric intrinsic factor gif expressed in parietal cells of the stomach mucosa specific proteins expressed in the stomach and duodenum involved in defence include mucin proteins such as mucin 6 and intelectin-1.nnfunctioneditnthe time taken for food or other ingested objects to transit through the gastrointestinal tract varies depending on many factors but roughly it takes less than an hour after a meal for 50 of stomach contents to empty into the intestines while total emptying takes around 2 hours subsequently 50 emptying of the small intestine takes between 1 and 2 hours finally transit through the colon takes 12 to 50 hours with wide variation between individuals.nnimmune functioneditnimmune barriereditnthe gastrointestinal tract forms an important part of the immune system the surface area of the digestive tract is estimated to be about 32 square meters or about half a badminton court with such a large exposure more than three times larger than the exposed surface of the skin these immune components function to prevent pathogens from entering the blood and lymph circulatory systems fundamental components of this protection are provided by the intestinal mucosal barrier which is composed of physical biochemical and immune elements elaborated by the intestinal mucosa microorganisms also are kept at bay by an extensive immune system comprising the gut-associated lymphoid tissue galtnthere are additional factors contributing to protection from pathogen invasion for example low ph ranging from 1 to 4 of the stomach is fatal for many microorganisms that enter it similarly mucus containing iga antibodies neutralizes many pathogenic microorganisms other factors in the gi tract contribution to immune function include enzymes secreted in the saliva and bile.nnimmune system homeostasiseditnbeneficial bacteria also can contribute to the homeostasis of the gastrointestinal immune system for example clostridia one of the most predominant bacterial groups in the gi tract play an important role in influencing the dynamics of the guts immune system it has been demonstrated that the intake of a high fiber diet could be the responsible for the induction of t-regulatory cells tregs this is due to the production of short-chain fatty acids during the fermentation of plant-derived nutrients such as butyrate and propionate basically the butyrate induces the differentiation of treg cells by enhancing histone h3 acetylation in the promoter and conserved non-coding sequence regions of the foxp3 locus thus regulating the t cells resulting in the reduction of the inflammatory response and allergies.nnintestinal microbiotaeditnthe large intestine hosts several kinds of bacteria that can deal with molecules that the human body cannot otherwise break down this is an example of symbiosis these bacteria also account for the production of gases at host-pathogen interface inside our intestinethis gas is released as flatulence when eliminated through the anus however the large intestine is mainly concerned with the absorption of water from digested material which is regulated by the hypothalamus and the re absorption of sodium as well as any nutrients that may have escaped primary digestion in the ileum.nhealth-enhancing intestinal bacteria of the gut flora serve to prevent the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria in the gut these two types of bacteria compete for space and food as there are limited resources within the intestinal tract a ratio of 80-85 beneficial to 1520 potentially harmful bacteria generally is considered normal within the intestines.nndetoxification and drug metabolismeditnenzymes such as cyp3a4 along with the antiporter activities are also instrumental in the intestines role of drug metabolism in the detoxification of antigens and xenobiotics.nnclinical significanceeditnthis section discusses related diseases medical associations with the gastrointestinal tract and use in surgery.nmain articles gastrointestinal disease and gastroenterologynfurther information clinical significancendiseaseseditnthere are many diseases and conditions that can affect the gastrointestinal system including infections inflammation and cancer.nvarious pathogens such as bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses can induce gastroenteritis which results from inflammation of the stomach and small intestine antibiotics to treat such bacterial infections can decrease the microbiome diversity of the gastrointestinal tract and further enable inflammatory mediators gastroenteritis is the most common disease of the gi tract.nnndiverticular disease is a condition that is very common in older people in industrialized countries it usually affects the large intestine but has been known to affect the small intestine as well diverticulosis occurs when pouches form on the intestinal wall once the pouches become inflamed it is known as diverticulitis.ninflammatory bowel disease is an inflammatory condition affecting the bowel walls and includes the subtypes crohns disease and ulcerative colitis while crohns can affect the entire gastrointestinal tract ulcerative colitis is limited to the large intestine crohns disease is widely regarded as an autoimmune disease although ulcerative colitis is often treated as though it were an autoimmune disease there is no consensus that it actually is such.nfunctional gastrointestinal disorders the most common of which is irritable bowel syndrome functional constipation and chronic functional abdominal pain are other functional disorders of the intestine that have physiological causes but do not have identifiable structural chemical or infectious pathologies.nnsymptomseditnseveral symptoms are used to indicate problems with the gastrointestinal tract:nnntreatmenteditngastrointestinal surgery can often be performed in the outpatient setting in the united states in 2012 operations on the digestive system accounted for 3 of the 25 most common ambulatory surgery procedures and constituted 9.1 percent of all outpatient ambulatory surgeries.nnimagingeditnvarious methods of imaging the gastrointestinal tract include the upper and lower gastrointestinal series:nnnother related diseaseseditnnuses of animal gutseditnintestines from animals other than humans are used in a number of ways from each species of livestock that is a source of milk a corresponding rennet is obtained from the intestines of milk-fed calves pig and calf intestines are eaten and pig intestines are used as
