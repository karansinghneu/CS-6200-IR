relativity or str is the generally accepted and experimentally well-confirmed physical theory regarding the relationship between space and time in albert einsteins original pedagogical treatment it is based on two postulates:nnnit was originally proposed by albert einstein in a paper published 26 september 1905 titled on the electrodynamics of moving bodies the inconsistency of newtonian mechanics with maxwells equations of electromagnetism and the lack of experimental confirmation for a hypothesized luminiferous aether led to the development of special relativity which corrects mechanics to handle situations involving motions at a significant fraction of the speed of light known as relativistic velocities as of today special relativity is the most accurate model of motion at any speed when gravitational effects are negligible even so the newtonian mechanics model is still useful as an approximation at small velocities relative to the speed of light due to its simplicity and high accuracy within its scope nspecial relativity implies a wide range of consequences which have been experimentally verified including length contraction time dilation relativistic mass massenergy equivalence a universal speed limit and relativity of simultaneity it has replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time with the notion of a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position rather than an invariant time interval between two events there is an invariant spacetime interval combined with other laws of physics the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy as expressed in the massenergy equivalence formula e mc where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.na defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the galilean transformations of newtonian mechanics with the lorentz transformations time and space cannot be defined separately from each other rather space and time are interwoven into a single continuum known as spacetime events that occur at the same time for one observer can occur at different times for another.nnot until einstein developed general relativity introducing a curved spacetime to incorporate gravity was the phrase special relativity employed a translation that has often been used is restricted relativity special really means special case".nthe theory is special in that it only applies in the special case where the spacetime is flat i.e the curvature of spacetime described by the energy-momentum tensor and causing gravity is negligible in order to include gravity einstein formulated general relativity in 1915 special relativity contrary to some outdated descriptions is capable of handling accelerations as well as accelerated frames of reference.nas galilean relativity is now considered an approximation of special relativity that is valid for low speeds special relativity is considered an approximation of general relativity that is valid for weak gravitational fields i.e at a sufficiently small scale for tidal forces and in conditions of free fall whereas general relativity incorporates noneuclidean geometry in order to represent gravitational effects as the geometric curvature of spacetime special relativity is restricted to the flat spacetime known as minkowski space as long as the universe can be modeled as a pseudo-riemannian manifold a lorentz-invariant frame that abides by special relativity can be defined for a sufficiently small neighborhood of each point in this curved spacetime.ngalileo galilei had already postulated that there is no absolute and well-defined state of rest no privileged reference frames a principle now called galileos principle of relativity einstein extended this principle so that it accounted for the constant speed of light a phenomenon that had been recently observed in the michelsonmorley experiment he also postulated that it holds for all the laws of physics including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics.nn albert einstein around 1905 the year his annus mirabilis papers were published these included zur elektrodynamik bewegter krper the paper founding special relativity.ncontentsnnnn traditional two postulates approach to special relativityeditnneinstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed to be the most assured regardless of the exact validity of the then known laws of either mechanics or electrodynamics these propositions were the constancy of the speed of light and the independence of physical laws especially the constancy of the speed of light from the choice of inertial system in his initial presentation of special relativity in 1905 he expressed these postulates as:nnnthe constancy of the speed of light was motivated by maxwells theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous ether there is conflicting evidence on the extent to which einstein was influenced by the null result of the michelsonmorley experiment in any case the null result of the michelsonmorley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.nthe derivation of special relativity depends not only on these two explicit postulates but also on several tacit assumptions made in almost all theories of physics including the isotropy and homogeneity of space and the independence of measuring rods and clocks from their past history.nfollowing einsteins original presentation of special relativity in 1905 many different sets of postulates have been proposed in various alternative derivations however the most common set of postulates remains those employed by einstein in his original paper a more mathematical statement of the principle of relativity made later by einstein which introduces the concept of simplicity not mentioned above is:nnspecial principle of relativity if a system of coordinates k is chosen so that in relation to it physical laws hold good in their simplest form the same laws hold good in relation to any other system of coordinates k moving in uniform translation relatively to k.nnhenri poincar provided the mathematical framework for relativity theory by proving that lorentz transformations are a subset of his poincar group of symmetry transformations einstein later derived these transformations from his axioms.nmany of einsteins papers present derivations of the lorentz transformation based upon these two principles.nnprinciple of relativityeditnmain article principle of relativitynreference frames and relative motioneditn figure 2-1 the primed system is in motion relative to the unprimed system with constant velocity v only along the x-axis from the perspective of an observer stationary in the unprimed system by the principle of relativity an observer stationary in the primed system will view a likewise construction except that the velocity they record will be v the changing of the speed of propagation of interaction from infinite in non-relativistic mechanics to a finite value will require a modification of the transformation equations mapping events in one frame to another.nreference frames play a crucial role in relativity theory the term reference frame as used here is an observational perspective in space which is not undergoing any change in motion acceleration from which a position can be measured along 3 spatial axes in addition a reference frame has the ability to determine measurements of the time of events using a clock any reference device with uniform periodicity.nan event is an occurrence that can be assigned a single unique time and location in space relative to a reference frame it is a point in spacetime since the speed of light is constant in relativity in each and every reference frame pulses of light can be used to unambiguously measure distances and refer back the times that events occurred to the clock even though light takes time to reach the clock after the event has transpired.nfor example the explosion of a firecracker may be considered to be an event we can completely specify an event by its four spacetime coordinates the time of occurrence and its 3-dimensional spatial location define a reference point lets call this reference frame s.nin relativity theory we often want to calculate the coordinates of an event from differing reference frames the equations that relate measurements made in different frames are called transformation equations.nnstandard configurationeditnto gain insight in how spacetime coordinates measured by observers in different reference frames compare with each other it is useful to work with a simplified setup with frames in a standard configuration with care this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached in fig 21 two galilean reference frames i.e conventional 3-space frames are displayed in relative motion frame s belongs to a first observer o and frame s pronounced s prime belongs to a second observer o nnnsince there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory a concept of moving doesnt strictly exist as everything is always moving with respect to some other reference frame instead any two frames that move at the same speed in the same direction are said to be comoving therefore s and s are not comoving.nnlack of an absolute reference frameeditnthe principle of relativity which states that physical laws have the same form in each inertial reference frame dates back to galileo and was incorporated into newtonian physics however in the late 19th century the existence of electromagnetic waves led physicists to suggest that the universe was filled with a substance that they called aether which would act as the medium through which these waves or vibrations travelled the aether was thought to constitute an absolute reference frame against which speeds could be measured and could be considered fixed and motionless aether supposedly possessed some wonderful properties it was sufficiently elastic to support electromagnetic waves and those waves could interact with matter yet it offered no resistance to bodies passing through it the results of various experiments including the michelsonmorley experiment led to the theory of special relativity by showing that there was no aether einsteins solution was to discard the notion of an aether and the absolute state of rest in relativity any reference frame moving with uniform motion will observe the same laws of physics in particular the speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be c even when measured by multiple systems that are moving at different but constant velocities.nnrelativity without the second postulateeditnfrom the principle of relativity alone without assuming the constancy of the speed of light i.e using the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by the principle of special relativity one can show that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either euclidean galilean or lorentzian in the lorentzian case one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and a certain finite limiting speed experiments suggest that this speed is the speed of light in vacuum.nn lorentz invariance as the essential core of special relativityeditnmain article lorentz transformationnalternative approaches to special relativityeditnmain article derivations of the lorentz transformationsneinstein consistently based the derivation of lorentz invariance the essential core of special relativity on just the two basic principles of relativity and light-speed invariance he wrote:nnthe insight fundamental for the special theory of relativity is this the assumptions relativity and light speed invariance are compatible if relations of a new type lorentz transformation are postulated for the conversion of coordinates and times of events the universal principle of the special theory of relativity is contained in the postulate the laws of physics are invariant with respect to lorentz transformations for the transition from one inertial system to any other arbitrarily chosen inertial system this is a restricting principle for natural laws...nnthus many modern treatments of special relativity base it on the single postulate of universal lorentz covariance or equivalently on the single postulate of minkowski spacetime.nrather than considering universal lorentz covariance to be a derived principle this article considers it to be the fundamental postulate of special relativity the traditional two-postulate approach to special relativity is presented in innumerable college textbooks and popular presentations textbooks starting with the single postulate of minkowski spacetime include those by taylor and wheeler and by callahan this is also the approach followed by the wikipedia articles spacetime and minkowski diagram.nnlorentz transformation and its inverseeditndefine an event to have spacetime coordinates t,x,y,z in system s and t,x,y,z in a reference frame moving at a velocity v with respect to that frame s then the lorentz transformation specifies that these coordinates are related in the following way:nnnwherennnis the lorentz factor and c is the speed of light in vacuum and the velocity v of s is parallel to the x-axis the y and z coordinates are unaffected only the x and t coordinates are transformed these lorentz transformations form a one-parameter group of linear mappings that parameter being called rapidity.nsolving the above four transformation equations for the unprimed coordinates yields the inverse lorentz transformation:nnnenforcing this inverse lorentz transformation to coincide with the lorentz transformation from the primed to the unprimed system shows the unprimed frame as moving with the velocity v v as measured in the primed frame.nthere is nothing special about the x-axis the transformation can apply to the y or z-axis or indeed in any direction which can be done by directions parallel to the motion which are warped by the factor and perpendicular see the article lorentz transformation for details.na quantity invariant under lorentz transformations is known as a lorentz scalar.nwriting the lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences where one event has coordinates x t and x t another event has coordinates x t and x t and the differences are defined asnnnwe getnnnif we take differentials instead of taking differences we getnnngraphical representation of the lorentz transformationeditnfigure 3-1 drawing a minkowski spacetime diagram to illustrate a lorentz transformation.nspacetime diagrams minkowski diagrams are an extremely useful aid to visualizing how coordinates transform between different reference frames although it is not as easy to perform exact computations using them as directly invoking the lorentz transformations their main power is their ability to provide an intuitive grasp of the results of a relativistic scenario.nto draw a spacetime diagram begin by considering two galilean reference frames s and s in standard configuration as shown in fig 21.nfig 31a draw the and axes of frame s the axis is horizontal and the actually axis is vertical which is the opposite of the usual convention in kinematics the axis is scaled by a factor of so that both axes have common units of length in the diagram shown the gridlines are spaced one unit distance apart the 45 diagonal lines represent the worldlines of two photons passing through the origin at time the slope of these worldlines is 1 because the photons advance one unit in space per unit of time two events and have been plotted on this graph so that their coordinates may be compared in the s and s frames nfig 31b draw the and axes of frame s the axis represents the worldline of the origin of the s coordinate system as measured in frame s in this figure both the and axes are tilted from the unprimed axes by an angle where the primed and unprimed axes share a common origin because frames s and s had been set up in standard configuration so that when nfig 31c units in the primed axes have a different scale from units in the unprimed axes from the lorentz transformations we observe that coordinates of in the primed coordinate system transform to in the unprimed coordinate system likewise coordinates of in the primed coordinate system transform to in the unprimed system draw gridlines parallel with the axis through points as measured in the unprimed frame where is an integer likewise draw gridlines parallel with the axis through as measured in the unprimed frame using the pythagorean theorem we observe that the spacing between units equals times the spacing between units as measured in frame s this ratio is always greater than 1 and it approaches infinity as nfig 31d since the speed of light is an invariant the worldlines of two photons passing through the origin at time still plot as 45 diagonal lines the primed coordinates of and are related to the unprimed coordinates through the lorentz transformations and could be approximately measured from the graph assuming that it has been plotted accurately enough but the real merit of a minkowski diagram is its granting us a geometric view of the scenario for example in this figure we observe that the two timelike-separated events that had different x-coordinates in the unprimed frame are now at the same position in space.nwhile the unprimed frame is drawn with space and time axes that meet at right angles the primed frame is drawn with axes that meet at acute or obtuse angles the frames are actually equivalent the asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a cartesian plane by analogy planar maps of the world are unavoidably distorted but with experience one learns to mentally account for these distortions.nnconsequences derived from the lorentz transformationeditnsee also twin paradox and relativistic mechanicsnthe consequences of special relativity can be derived from the lorentz transformation equations these transformations and hence special relativity lead to different physical predictions than those of newtonian mechanics when relative velocities become comparable to the speed of light the speed of light is so much larger than anything humans encounter that some of the effectsnpredicted by relativity are initially counterintuitive.nninvariant intervaleditnin galilean relativity length and temporal separation between two events are independent invariants the values of which do not change when observed from different frames of reference.nin special relativity however the interweaving of spatial and temporal coordinates generates the concept of an invariant interval denoted as nnnthe interweaving of space and time revokes the implicitly assumed concepts of absolute simultaneity and synchronization across non-comoving frames nthe form of being the difference of the squared time lapse and the squared spatial distance demonstrates a fundamental discrepancy between euclidean and spacetime distances the invariance of this interval is a property of the general lorentz transform also called the poincar transformation making it an isometry of spacetime the general lorentz transform extends the standard lorentz transform which deals with translations without rotation i.e lorentz boosts in the x-direction with all other translations reflections and rotations between any cartesian inertial frame.nin the analysis of simplified scenarios such as spacetime diagrams a reduced-dimensionality form of the invariant interval is often employed:nnndemonstrating that the interval is invariant is straightforward for the reduced-dimensionality case and with frames in standard configuration:nnnthe value of is hence independent of the frame in which it is measured nin considering the physical significance of there are three cases to note:nnnrelativity of simultaneityeditnsee also relativity of simultaneity and ladder paradoxn figure 4-1 the three events a b c are simultaneous in the reference frame of some observer o in a reference frame moving at v 0.3c as measured by o the events occur in the order c b a in a reference frame moving at v 0.5c with respect to o the events occur in the order a b c the white lines the lines of simultaneity move from the past to the future in the respective frames green coordinate axes highlighting events residing on it they are the locus of all events occurring at the same time in the respective frame the gray area is the light cone with respect to the origin of all considered frames.ntwo events happening in two different locations that occur simultaneously in the reference frame of one inertial observer may occur non-simultaneously in the reference frame of another inertial observer lack of absolute simultaneity.nfrom equation 3 the forward lorentz transformation in terms of coordinate differencesnnnit is clear that two events that are simultaneous in frame s satisfying t 0 are not necessarily simultaneous in another inertial frame s satisfying t 0 only if these events are additionally co-local in frame s satisfying x 0 will they be simultaneous in another frame s.nthe sagnac effect can be considered a manifestation of the relativity of simultaneity since relativity of simultaneity is a first order effect in instruments based on the sagnac effect for their operation such as ring laser gyroscopes and fiber optic gyroscopes are capable of extreme levels of sensitivity.nntime dilationeditnsee also time dilationnthe time lapse between two events is not invariant from one observer to another but is dependent on the relative speeds of the observers reference frames e.g the twin paradox which concerns a twin who flies off in a spaceship traveling near the speed of light and returns to discover that the non-traveling twin sibling has aged much more nsuppose a clock is at rest in the unprimed system s the location of the clock on two different ticks is then characterized by x 0 to find the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems equation 3 can be used to find:nnnthis shows that the time t between the two ticks as seen in the frame in which the clock is moving s is longer than the time t between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock s time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena for example the lifetime of high speed muons created by the collision of cosmic rays with particles in the earths outer atmosphere and moving towards the surface is greater than the lifetime of slowly moving muons created and decaying in a laboratory.nnlength contractioneditnsee also lorentz contractionnthe dimensions e.g length of an object as measured by one observer may be smaller than the results of measurements of the same object made by another observer e.g the ladder paradox involves a long ladder traveling near the speed of light and being contained within a smaller garage.nsimilarly suppose a measuring rod is at rest and aligned along the x-axis in the unprimed system s in this system the length of this rod is written as x to measure the length of this rod in the system s in which the rod is moving the distances x to the end points of the rod must be measured simultaneously in that system s in other words the measurement is characterized by t 0 which can be combined with equation 3 to find the relation between the lengths x and x:nnnthis shows that the length x of the rod as measured in the frame in which it is moving s is shorter than its length x in its own rest frame s.ntime dilation and length contraction are not merely appearances time dilation is explicitly related to our way of measuring time intervals between events which occur at the same place in a given coordinate system called co-local events these time intervals will be different in another coordinate system moving with respect to the first unless the events in addition to being co-local are also simultaneous similarly length contraction relates to our measured distances between separated but simultaneous events in a given coordinate system of choice if these events are not co-local but are separated by distance space they will not occur at the same spatial distance from each other when seen from another moving coordinate system.nnlorentz transformation of velocitieseditnsee also velocity-addition formulanconsider two frames s and s in standard configuration a particle in s moves in the x direction with velocity vector what is its velocity in frame s nwe can writennnnsubstituting expressions for and from equation 5 into equation 8 followed by straightforward mathematical manipulations and back-substitution from equation 7 yields the lorentz transformation of the speed to nnnthe inverse relation is obtained by interchanging the primed and unprimed symbols and replacing with nnnfor not aligned along the x-axis we write:nnnnthe forward and inverse transformations for this case are:nnnnequation 10 and equation 14 can be interpreted as giving the resultant of the two velocities and and they replace the formula which is valid in galilean relativity interpreted in such a fashion they are commonly referred to as the relativistic velocity addition or composition formulas valid for the three axes of s and s being aligned with each other although not necessarily in standard configuration.nwe note the following points:nnnthere is nothing special about the x direction in the standard configuration the above formalism applies to any direction and three orthogonal directions allow dealing with all directions in space by decomposing the velocity vectors to their components in these directions see velocity-addition formula for details.nnthomas rotationeditnsee also thomas rotationnfigure 4-2 thomas-wigner rotationnthe composition of two non-collinear lorentz boosts i.e two non-collinear lorentz transformations neither of which involve rotation results in a lorentz transformation that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation nthomas rotation results from the relativity of simultaneity in fig 42a a rod of length in its rest frame i.e having a proper length of rises vertically along the yaxis in the ground frame nin fig 42b the same rod is observed from the frame of a rocket moving at speed to the right if we imagine two clocks situated at the left and right ends of the rod that are synchronized in the frame of the rod relativity of simultaneity causes the observer in the rocket frame to observe not see the clock at the right end of the rod as being advanced in time by and the rod is correspondingly observed as tilted.nunlike second-order relativistic effects such as length contraction or time dilation this effect becomes quite significant even at fairly low velocities for example this can be seen in the spin of moving particles where thomas precession is a relativistic correction that applies to the spin of an elementary particle or the rotation of a macroscopic gyroscope relating the angular velocity of the spin of a particle following a curvilinear orbit to the angular velocity of the orbital motion.nthomas rotation provides the resolution to the well-known meter stick and hole paradox".nncausality and prohibition of motion faster than lighteditnsee also causality physics and tachyonic antitelephonen figure 4-3 light conein fig 43 the interval between the events a and b is time-like i.e there is a frame of reference in which events a and b occur at the same location in space separated only by occurring at different times if a precedes b in that frame then a precedes b in all frames accessible by a lorentz transformation it is possible for matter or information to travel below light speed from the location of a starting at the time of a to the location of b arriving at the time of b so there can be a causal relationship with a the cause and b the effect.nthe interval ac in the diagram is space-like i.e there is a frame of reference in which events a and c occur simultaneously separated only in space there are also frames in which a precedes c as shown and frames in which c precedes a however there are no frames accessible by a lorentz transformation in which events a and c occur at the same location if it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship to exist between events a and c then paradoxes of causality would result.nfor example if signals could be sent faster than light then signals could be sent into the senders past observer b in the diagrams a variety of causal paradoxes could then be constructed nnfigure 4-4 causality violation by the use of fictitious"instantaneous communicators"nconsider the spacetime diagrams in fig 44 a and b stand alongside a railroad track when a high speed train passes by with c riding in the last car of the train and d riding in the leading car the world lines of a and b are vertical ct distinguishing the stationary position of these observers on the ground while the world lines of c and d are tilted forwards ct reflecting the rapid motion of the observers c and d stationary in their train as observed from the ground.nnnas seen from the spacetime diagram b will receive the message before having sent it out a violation of causality.nit is not necessary for signals to be instantaneous to violate causality even if the signal from d to c were slightly shallower than the axis and the signal from a to b slightly steeper than the axis it would still be possible for b to receive his message before he had sent it by increasing the speed of the train to near light speeds the and axes can be squeezed very close to the dashed line representing the speed of light with this modified setup it can be demonstrated that even signals only slightly faster than the speed of light will result in causality violation.ntherefore if causality is to be preserved one of the consequences of special relativity is that no information signal or material object can travel faster than light in vacuum nthis is not to say that all faster than light speeds are impossible various trivial situations can be described where some things move faster than light for example the location where the beam of a search light hits the bottom of a cloud can move faster than light when the search light is turned rapidly.nnoptical effectseditndragging effectseditnmain article fizeau experimentn figure 5-1 highly simplified diagram of fizeaus 1851 experiment.nin 1850 hippolyte fizeau and lon foucault independently established that light travels more slowly in water than in air thus validating a prediction of fresnels wave theory of light and invalidating the corresponding prediction of newtons corpuscular theory the speed of light was measured in still water what would be the speed of light in flowing water?nin 1851 fizeau conducted an experiment to answer this question a simplified representation of which is illustrated in fig 51 a beam of light is divided by a beam splitter and the split beams are passed in opposite directions through a tube of flowing water they are recombined to form interference fringes that an observer can view dragging of the light by the flowing water causes displacement of the fringes.naccording to the theories prevailing at the time light traveling through a moving medium would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus the speed of the medium contrary to expectation fizeau found that although light appeared to be dragged by the water the magnitude of the dragging was much lower than expected if is the speed of light in still water and is the speed of the water and is the water-bourne speed of light in the lab frame with the flow of water adding to or subtracting from the speed of light thennnnfizeaus results although consistent with fresnels earlier hypothesis of partial aether dragging were extremely disconcerting to physicists of the time among other things the presence of an index of refraction term meant that since depends on wavelength the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time a variety of theoretical explanations were proposed to explain fresnels dragging coefficient that were completely at odds with each other even before the michelsonmorley experiment fizeaus experimental results were among a number of observations that created a critical situation in explaining the optics of moving bodies.nfrom the point of view of special relativity fizeaus result is nothing but an approximation to equation 10 the relativistic formula for composition of velocities.nnnrelativistic aberration of lighteditnmain articles aberration of light and light-time correctionn figure 5-2 illustration of stellar aberrationnbecause of the finite speed of light if the relative motions of a source and receiver include a transverse component then the direction from which light arrives at the receiver will be displaced from the geometric position in space of the source relative to the receiver the classical calculation of the displacement takes two forms and makes different predictions depending on whether the receiver the source or both are in motion with respect to the medium 1 if the receiver is in motion the displacement would be the consequence of the aberration of light the incident angle of the beam relative to the receiver would be calculable from the vector sum of the receivers motions and the velocity of the incident light 2 if the source is in motion the displacement would be the consequence of light-time correction the displacement of the apparent position of the source from its geometric position would be the result of the sources motion during the time that its light takes to reach the receiver.nthe classical explanation failed experimental test since the aberration angle depends on the relationship between the velocity of the receiver and the speed of the incident light passage of the incident light through a refractive medium should change the aberration angle in 1810 arago used this expected phenomenon in a failed attempt to measure the speed of light and in 1870 george airy tested the hypothesis using a water-filled telescope finding that against expectation the measured aberration was identical to the aberration measured with an air-filled telescope a cumbrous attempt to explain these results used the hypothesis of partial aether-drag but was incompatible with the results of the michelsonmorley experiment which apparently demanded complete aether-drag.nassuming inertial frames the relativistic expression for the aberration of light is applicable to both the receiver moving and source moving cases a variety of trigonometrically equivalent formulas have been published expressed in terms of the variables in fig 52 these includennnrelativistic doppler effecteditnmain article relativistic doppler effectnrelativistic longitudinal doppler effecteditnthe classical doppler effect depends on whether the source receiver or both are in motion with respect to the medium the relativistic doppler effect is independent of any medium nevertheless relativistic doppler shift for the longitudinal case with source and receiver moving directly towards or away from each other is often derived as if it were the classical phenomenon but modified by the addition of a time dilation term.nassume the receiver and the source are moving away from each other with a relative speed as measured by an observer on the receiver or the source the sign convention adopted here is that is negative if the receiver and the source are moving towards each other assume that the source is stationary in the medium thennnnwhere is the speed of sound.nfor light and with the receiver moving at relativistic speeds clocks on the receiver are time dilated relative to clocks at the source the receiver will measure the received frequency to bennnwherennnan identical expression for relativistic doppler shift is obtained when performing the analysis in the reference frame of the receiver with a moving source.nntransverse doppler effecteditn figure 5-3 transverse doppler effect for two scenarios a receiver moving in a circle around the source b source moving in a circle around the receiver.nthe transverse doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the special theory of relativity nclassically one might expect that if source and receiver are moving transversely with respect to each other with no longitudinal component to their relative motions that there should be no doppler shift in the light arriving at the receiver nspecial relativity predicts otherwise fig 53 illustrates two common variants of this scenario both variants can be analyzed using simple time dilation arguments in fig 53a the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of in fig 53b the light is redshifted by the same factor.nnmeasurement versus visual appearanceeditntime dilation and length contraction are not optical illusions but genuine effects measurements of these effects are not an artifact of doppler shift nor are they the result of neglecting to take into account the time it takes light to travel from an event to an observer.nscientists make a fundamental distinction between measurement or observation on the one hand versus visual appearance or what one sees the measured shape of an object is a hypothetical snapshot of all of the objects points as they exist at a single moment in time the visual appearance of an object however is affected by the varying lengths of time that light takes to travel from different points on the object to ones eye.nn figure 5-4 comparison of the measured length contraction of a cube versus its visual appearance.nfor many years the distinction between the two had not been generally appreciated and it had generally been thought that a length contracted object passing by an observer would in fact actually be seen as length contracted in 1959 james terrell and roger penrose independently pointed out that differential time lag effects in signals reaching the observer from the different parts of a moving object result in a fast moving objects visual appearance being quite different from its measured shape for example a receding object would appear contracted an approaching object would appear elongated and a passing object would have a skew appearance that has been likened to a rotation a sphere in motion retains the appearance of a sphere although images on the surface of the sphere will appear distorted.nn figure 5-5 galaxy m87 streams out a black-hole-powered jet of electrons and other sub-atomic particles traveling at nearly the speed of light.nfig 54 illustrates a cube viewed from a distance of four times the length of its sides at high speeds the sides of the cube that are perpendicular to the direction of motion appear hyperbolic in shape the cube is actually not rotated rather light from the rear of the cube takes longer to reach ones eyes compared with light from the front during which time the cube has moved to the right this illusion has come to be known as terrell rotation or the terrellpenrose effect.nanother example where visual appearance is at odds with measurement comes from the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies bl lac objects quasars and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer an optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel in fig 55 galaxy m87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us but penroseterrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in fig 54 has been stretched out.nndynamicseditnsection consequences derived from the lorentz transformation dealt strictly with kinematics the study of the motion of points bodies and systems of bodies without considering the forces that caused the motion this section discusses masses forces energy and so forth and as such requires consideration of physical effects beyond those encompassed by the lorentz transformation itself.nnequivalence of mass and energyeditnmain article massenergy equivalencenas an objects speed approaches the speed of light from an observers point of view its relativistic mass increases thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observers frame of reference.nthe energy content of an object at rest with mass m equals mc conservation of energy implies that in any reaction a decrease of the sum of the masses of particles must be accompanied by an increase in kinetic energies of the particles after the reaction similarly the mass of an object can be increased by taking in kinetic energies.nin addition to the papers referenced abovewhich give derivations of the lorentz transformation and describe the foundations of special relativityeinstein also wrote at least four papers giving heuristic arguments for the equivalence and transmutability of mass and energy for e mc.nmassenergy equivalence is a consequence of special relativity the energy and momentum which are separate in newtonian mechanics form a four-vector in relativity and this relates the time component the energy to the space components the momentum in a non-trivial way for an object at rest the energymomentum four-vector is e/c 0 0 0 it has a time component which is the energy and three space components which are zero by changing frames with a lorentz transformation in the x direction with a small value of the velocity v the energy momentum four-vector becomes e/c ev/c 0 0 the momentum is equal to the energy multiplied by the velocity divided by c as such the newtonian mass of an object which is the ratio of the momentum to the velocity for slow velocities is equal to e/c.nthe energy and momentum are properties of matter and radiation and it is impossible to deduce that they form a four-vector just from the two basic postulates of special relativity by themselves because these dont talk about matter or radiation they only talk about space and time the derivation therefore requires some additional physical reasoning in his 1905 paper einstein used the additional principles that newtonian mechanics should hold for slow velocities so that there is one energy scalar and one three-vector momentum at slow velocities and that the conservation law for energy and momentum is exactly true in relativity furthermore he assumed that the energy of light is transformed by the same doppler-shift factor as its frequency which he had previously shown to be true based on maxwells equations the first of einsteins papers on this subject was does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy content in 1905 although einsteins argument in this paper is nearly universally accepted by physicists as correct even self-evident many authors over the years have suggested that it is wrong other authors suggest that the argument was merely inconclusive because it relied on some implicit assumptions.neinstein acknowledged the controversy over his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity there he notes that it is problematic to rely on maxwells equations for the heuristic massenergy argument the argument in his 1905 paper can be carried out with the emission of any massless particles but the maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work to emit electromagnetic waves all you have to do is shake a charged particle and this is clearly doing work so that the emission is of energy.nnhow far can one travel from the earth?editnsee also space travel using constant accelerationnsince one can not travel faster than light one might conclude that a human can never travel farther from earth than 40 light years if the traveler is active between the ages of 20 and 60 one would easily think that a traveler would never be able to reach more than the very few solar systems which exist within the limit of 2040 light years from the earth but that would be a mistaken conclusion because of time dilation a hypothetical spaceship can travel thousands of light years during the pilots 40 active years if a spaceship could be built that accelerates at a constant 1g it will after a little less than a year be travelling at almost the speed of light as seen from earth this is described by:nnnwhere vt is the velocity at a time t a is the acceleration of 1g and t is the time as measured by people on earth therefore after one year of accelerating at 9.81 m/s the spaceship will be travelling at v 0.77c relative to earth time dilation will increase the travellers life span as seen from the reference frame of the earth to 2.7 years but his lifespan measured by a clock travelling with him will not change during his journey people on earth will experience more time than he does a 5-year round trip for him will take 6.5 earth years and cover a distance of over 6 light-years a 20-year round trip for him 5 years accelerating 5 decelerating twice each will land him back on earth having travelled for 335 earth years and a distance of 331 light years a full 40-year trip at 1g will appear on earth to last 58,000 years and cover a distance of 55,000 light years a 40-year trip at 1.1g will take 148,000 earth years and cover about 140,000 light years a one-way 28 year 14 years accelerating 14 decelerating as measured with the astronauts clock trip at 1g acceleration could reach 2,000,000 light-years to the andromeda galaxy this same time dilation is why a muon travelling close to c is observed to travel much further than c times its half-life when at rest.nnrelativity and unifying electromagnetismeditnmain articles classical electromagnetism and special relativity and covariant formulation of classical electromagnetismntheoretical investigation in classical electromagnetism led to the discovery of wave propagation equations generalizing the electromagnetic effects found that finite propagation speed of the e and b fields required certain behaviors on charged particles the general study of moving charges forms the linardwiechert potential which is a step towards special relativity.nthe lorentz transformation of the electric field of a moving charge into a non-moving observers reference frame results in the appearance of a mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field conversely the magnetic field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely electrostatic field in a comoving frame of reference maxwells equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the universe as electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined one speaks of electromagnetic fields special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.nmaxwells equations in the 3d form are already consistent with the physical content of special relativity although they are easier to manipulate in a manifestly covariant form i.e in the language of tensor calculus.nntheories of relativity and quantum mechanicseditnspecial relativity can be combined with quantum mechanics to form relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics it is an unsolved problem in physics how general relativity and quantum mechanics can be unified quantum gravity and a theory of everything which require a unification including general relativity too are active and ongoing areas in theoretical research.nthe early bohrsommerfeld atomic model explained the fine structure of alkali metal atoms using both special relativity and the preliminary knowledge on quantum mechanics of the time.nin 1928 paul dirac constructed an influential relativistic wave equation now known as the dirac equation in his honour that is fully compatible both with special relativity and with the final version of quantum theory existing after 1926 this equation explained not only the intrinsic angular momentum of the electrons called spin it also led to the prediction of the antiparticle of the electron the positron and fine structure could only be fully explained with special relativity it was the first foundation of relativistic quantum mechanics in non-relativistic quantum mechanics spin is phenomenological and cannot be explained.non the other hand the existence of antiparticles leads to the conclusion that relativistic quantum mechanics is not enough for a more accurate and complete theory of particle interactions instead a theory of particles interpreted as quantized fields called quantum field theory becomes necessary in which particles can be created and destroyed throughout space and time.nnstatuseditnmain articles tests of special relativity and criticism of relativity theorynspecial relativity in its minkowski spacetime is accurate only when the absolute value of the gravitational potential is much less than c in the region of interest in a strong gravitational field one must use general relativity general relativity becomes special relativity at the limit of a weak field at very small scales such as at the planck length and below quantum effects must be taken into consideration resulting in quantum gravity however at macroscopic scales and in the absence of strong gravitational fields special relativity is experimentally tested to extremely high degree of accuracy 10nand thus accepted by the physics community experimental results which appear to contradict it are not reproducible and are thus widely believed to be due to experimental errors.nspecial relativity is mathematically self-consistent and it is an organic part of all modern physical theories most notably quantum field theory string theory and general relativity in the limiting case of negligible gravitational fields.nnewtonian mechanics mathematically follows from special relativity at small velocities compared to the speed of light thus newtonian mechanics can be considered as a special relativity of slow moving bodies see classical mechanics for a more detailed discussion.nseveral experiments predating einsteins 1905 paper are now interpreted as evidence for relativity of these it is known einstein was aware of the fizeau experiment before 1905 and historians have concluded that einstein was at least aware of the michelsonmorley experiment as early as 1899 despite claims he made in his later years that it played no role in his development of the theory.nnnparticle accelerators routinely accelerate and measure the properties of particles moving at near the speed of light where their behavior is completely consistent with relativity theory and inconsistent with the earlier newtonian mechanics these machines would simply not work if they were not engineered according to relativistic principles in addition a considerable number of modern experiments have been conducted to test special relativity some examples:nnntechnical discussion of spacetimeeditnmain article minkowski spacengeometry of spacetimeeditncomparison between flat euclidean space and minkowski spaceeditnsee also line elementn figure 10-1 orthogonality and rotation of coordinate systems compared between left euclidean space through circular angle right in minkowski spacetime through hyperbolic angle red lines labelled c denote the worldlines of a light signal a vector is orthogonal to itself if it lies on this line.nspecial relativity uses a flat 4-dimensional minkowski space an example of a spacetime minkowski spacetime appears to be very similar to the standard 3-dimensional euclidean space but there is a crucial difference with respect to time.nin 3d space the differential of distance line element ds is defined bynnnwhere dx dx dx dx are the differentials of the three spatial dimensions in minkowski geometry there is an extra dimension with coordinate x derived from time such that the distance differential fulfillsnnnwhere dx dx dx dx dx are the differentials of the four spacetime dimensions this suggests a deep theoretical insight special relativity is simply a rotational symmetry of our spacetime analogous to the rotational symmetry of euclidean space see fig 101 just as euclidean space uses a euclidean metric so spacetime uses a minkowski metric basically special relativity can be stated as the invariance of any spacetime interval that is the 4d distance between any two events when viewed from any inertial reference frame all equations and effects of special relativity can be derived from this rotational symmetry the poincar group of minkowski spacetime.nthe actual form of ds above depends on the metric and on the choices for the x coordinate.nto make the time coordinate look like the space coordinates it can be treated as imaginary x ict this is called a wick rotation.naccording to misner thorne and wheeler 1971 2.3 ultimately the deeper understanding of both special and general relativity will come from the study of the minkowski metric described below and to take x ct rather than a disguised euclidean metric using ict as the time coordinate.nsome authors use x t with factors of c elsewhere to compensate for instance spatial coordinates are divided by c or factors of c are included in the metric tensor.nthese numerous conventions can be superseded by using natural units where c 1 then space and time have equivalent units and no factors of c appear anywhere.nn3d spacetimeeditn figure 10-2 three-dimensional dual-cone.nif we reduce the spatial dimensions to 2 so that we can represent the physics in a 3d spacennnwe see that the null geodesics lie along a dual-cone see fig 102 defined by the equation;nnnor simplynnn which is the equation of a circle of radius c dt.nn4d spacetimeeditnif we extend this to three spatial dimensions the null geodesics are the 4-dimensional cone:nnnso nnn figure 10-3 concentric spheres illustrating in 3-space the null geodesics of a 4-dimensional cone in spacetime.nas illustrated in fig 103 the null geodesics can be visualized as a set of continuous concentric spheres with radii c dt.nthis null dual-cone represents the line of sight of a point in space that is when we look at the stars and say the light from that star which i am receiving is x years old we are looking down this line of sight a null geodesic we are looking at an event a distance away and a time d/c in the past for this reason the null dual cone is also known as the light cone the point in the lower left of the fig 102 represents the star the origin represents the observer and the line represents the null geodesic line of sight".nthe cone in the t region is the information that the point is receiving while the cone in the t section is the information that the point is sending.nthe geometry of minkowski space can be depicted using minkowski diagrams which are useful also in understanding many of the thought-experiments in special relativity.nnote that in 4d spacetime the concept of the center of mass becomes more complicated see center of mass relativistic.nnphysics in spacetimeeditntransformations of physical quantities between reference frameseditnabove the lorentz transformation for the time coordinate and three space coordinates illustrates that they are intertwined this is true more generally certain pairs of timelike and spacelike quantities naturally combine on equal footing under the same lorentz transformation.nthe lorentz transformation in standard configuration above i.e for a boost in the x direction can be recast into matrix form as follows:nnnin newtonian mechanics quantities which have magnitude and direction are mathematically described as 3d vectors in euclidean space and in general they are parametrized by time in special relativity this notion is extended by adding the appropriate timelike quantity to a spacelike vector quantity and we have 4d vectors or four vectors in minkowski spacetime the components of vectors are written using tensor index notation as this has numerous advantages the notation makes it clear the equations are manifestly covariant under the poincar group thus bypassing the tedious calculations to check this fact in constructing such equations we often find that equations previously thought to be unrelated are in fact closely connected being part of the same tensor equation recognizing other physical quantities as tensors simplifies their transformation laws throughout upper indices superscripts are contravariant indices rather than exponents except when they indicate a square this should be clear from the context and lower indices subscripts are covariant indices for simplicity and consistency with the earlier equations cartesian coordinates will be used.nthe simplest example of a four-vector is the position of an event in spacetime which constitutes a timelike component ct and spacelike component x x y z in a contravariant position four vector with components:nnnwhere we define x ct so that the time coordinate has the same dimension of distance as the other spatial dimensions so that space and time are treated equally now the transformation of the contravariant components of the position 4-vector can be compactly written as:nnnwhere there is an implied summation on from 0 to 3 and is a matrix.nmore generally all contravariant components of a four-vector transform from one frame to another frame by a lorentz transformation:nnnexamples of other 4-vectors include the four-velocity defined as the derivative of the position 4-vector with respect to proper time:nnnwhere the lorentz factor is:nnnthe relativistic energy and relativistic momentum of an object are respectively the timelike and spacelike components of a contravariant four momentum vector:nnnwhere m is the invariant mass.nthe four-acceleration is the proper time derivative of 4-velocity:nnnthe transformation rules for three-dimensional velocities and accelerations are very awkward even above in standard configuration the velocity equations are quite complicated owing to their non-linearity on the other hand the transformation of four-velocity and four-acceleration are simpler by means of the lorentz transformation matrix.nthe four-gradient of a scalar field transforms covariantly rather than contravariantly:nnnwhich is the transpose of:nnnonly in cartesian coordinates its the covariant derivative which transforms in manifest covariance in cartesian coordinates this happens to reduce to the partial derivatives but not in other coordinates.nmore generally the covariant components of a 4-vector transform according to the inverse lorentz transformation:nnnwhere is the reciprocal matrix of nthe postulates of special relativity constrain the exact form the lorentz transformation matrices take.nmore generally most physical quantities are best described as components of tensors so to transform from one frame to another we use the well-known tensor transformation lawnnnwhere is the reciprocal matrix of all tensors transform by this rule.nan example of a four dimensional second order antisymmetric tensor is the relativistic angular momentum which has six components three are the classical angular momentum and the other three are related to the boost of the center of mass of the system the derivative of the relativistic angular momentum with respect to proper time is the relativistic torque also second order antisymmetric tensor.nthe electromagnetic field tensor is another second order antisymmetric tensor field with six components three for the electric field and another three for the magnetic field there is also the stressenergy tensor for the electromagnetic field namely the electromagnetic stressenergy tensor.nnmetriceditnthe metric tensor allows one to define the inner product of two vectors which in turn allows one to assign a magnitude to the vector given the four-dimensional nature of spacetime the minkowski metric has components valid in any inertial reference frame which can be arranged in a 4 4 matrix:nnnwhich is equal to its reciprocal in those frames throughout we use the signs as above different authors use different conventions see minkowski metric alternative signs.nthe poincar group is the most general group of transformations which preserves the minkowski metric:nnnand this is the physical symmetry underlying special relativity.nthe metric can be used for raising and lowering indices on vectors and tensors invariants can be constructed using the metric the inner product of a 4-vector t with another 4-vector s is:nnninvariant means that it takes the same value in all inertial frames because it is a scalar 0 rank tensor and so no appears in its trivial transformation the magnitude of the 4-vector t is the positive square root of the inner product with itself:nnnone can extend this idea to tensors of higher order for a second order tensor we can form the invariants:nnnsimilarly for higher order tensors invariant expressions particularly inner products of 4-vectors with themselves provide equations that are useful for calculations because one doesnt need to perform lorentz transformations to determine the invariants.nnrelativistic kinematics and invarianceeditnthe coordinate differentials transform also contravariantly:nnnso the squared length of the differential of the position four-vector dx constructed usingnnnis an invariant notice that when the line element dx is negative that dx is the differential of proper time while when dx is positive dx is differential of the proper distance.nthe 4-velocity u has an invariant form:nnnwhich means all velocity four-vectors have a magnitude of c this is an expression of the fact that there is no such thing as being at coordinate rest in relativity at the least you are always moving forward through time differentiating the above equation by produces:nnnso in special relativity the acceleration four-vector and the velocity four-vector are orthogonal.nnrelativistic dynamics and invarianceeditnthe invariant magnitude of the momentum 4-vector generates the energymomentum relation:nnnwe can work out what this invariant is by first arguing that since it is a scalar it doesnt matter in which reference frame we calculate it and then by transforming to a frame where the total momentum is zero.nnnwe see that the rest energy is an independent invariant a rest energy can be calculated even for particles and systems in motion by translating to a frame in which momentum is zero.nthe rest energy is related to the mass according to the celebrated equation discussed above:nnnnote that the mass of systems measured in their center of momentum frame where total momentum is zero is given by the total energy of the system in this frame it may not be equal to the sum of individual system masses measured in other frames.nto use newtons third law of motion both forces must be defined as the rate of change of momentum with respect to the same time coordinate that is it requires the 3d force defined above unfortunately there is no tensor in 4d which contains the components of the 3d force vector among its components.nif a particle is not traveling at c one can transform the 3d force from the particles co-moving reference frame into the observers reference frame this yields a 4-vector called the four-force it is the rate of change of the above energy momentum four-vector with respect to proper time the covariant version of the four-force is:nnnin the rest frame of the object the time component of the four force is zero unless the invariant mass of the object is changing this requires a non-closed system in which energy/mass is being directly added or removed from the object in which case it is the negative of that rate of change of mass times c in general though the components of the four force are not equal to the components of the three-force because the three force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to coordinate time i.e dp/dt while the four force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to proper time i.e dp/d.nin a continuous medium the 3d density of force combines with the density of power to form a covariant 4-vector the spatial part is the result of dividing the force on a small cell in 3-space by the volume of that cell the time component is 1/c times the power transferred to that cell divided by the volume of the cell this will be used below in the section on electromagnetism.nnsee alsoeditnnnnprimary sourceseditnnnreferenceseditnnnnoteseditnnntextbookseditnnjournal
