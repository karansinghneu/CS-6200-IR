appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed trans-alaska pipeline system the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to 900 million at once it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.nthe alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation from its initial principal of 734,000 the fund has grown to 50 billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum.nstarting in 1982 dividends from the funds annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial 1,000 in 1982 equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to 3,269 in 2008 which included a one-time 1,200 resource rebate every year the state legislature takes out 8 from the earnings puts 3 back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining 5 is distributed to all qualifying alaskans to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.nthe permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world.nncost of livingnthe cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and active-duty military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25 of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country.nrural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.nnagriculture

farms are in either the matanuska valley about 40 miles 64 km northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about 60 miles 97 km southwest of anchorage the short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage.nthe tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction area about 100 miles 160 km southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops these farms mostly lie north and east of fort

from outside and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive although most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes the cost of transport can reach as high as 50 per pound 1.10/kg or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions the cost of delivering a 1 us gallon 3.8 l of milk is about 3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be
