of 2008 the blue shell indicates the estimated size of the termination shock they have entered whereas the grey annulus shows the kuiper belt the yellow shell indicates one light-day distance from the sun and the yellow arrow the vernal point click on image for larger view and links to other scales.ntrajectories of distant spacecraft from launch to 2030top polar view bottom equatorial viewn plot of voyager 2s heliocentric velocity against its distance from the sun illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by jupiter saturn and uranus and finally its encounter with neptunes triton gravity assists are akin to bouncing the spacecraft off a planet but because the planet is moving it doesnt just bounce but is pushed by the planet like when a baseball is hit by a moving baseball bat.nbelow is a list of artificial objects leaving the solar system all of these objects are space probes and their upper stages launched by nasa nof the major spacecraft voyager 1 voyager 2 and new horizons are still functioning and are regularly contacted by radio communication while pioneer 10 and pioneer 11 are now derelict in addition to these spacecraft some third stages and de-spin weights are leaving the solar system assuming they continue on their trajectories nthese objects are leaving the solar system because their velocity and direction are taking them away from the sun and at their distance from the sun its gravitational pull is not sufficient to pull these objects back or into orbit they are not impervious to the gravitational pull of the sun and are being slowed down but they are predicted to have enough velocity to coast into interstellar space i.e retaining sufficient escape velocity to leave the solar system.nncontentsnnnplanetary exploration probeseditnnalthough other probes were launched first voyager 1 has achieved a higher speed and overtaken all others voyager 1 overtook voyager 2 a few months after launch on 19 december 1977 it overtook pioneer 11 in 1983 and then pioneer 10becoming the probe farthest from earthon february 17 1998.nvoyager 2 is also moving faster than the probes launched earlier having overtaken pioneer 11 by march 1988 it is projected to overtake pioneer 10 in 2023.ndepending on how the pioneer anomaly affects it new horizons will also probably pass the pioneer probes but will need many years to do so it will not overtake pioneer 11 until the 22nd century will not overtake pioneer 10 until the end of that century and will never overtake the voyagers.nndistance and speed from the suneditnnsource heavens above and jplnsolar escape velocity is a function of distance r from the suns center given by nnnwhere the product g m is the heliocentric gravitational parameter the initial speed required to escape the sun from its surface is 618 km/s 1,380,000 mph and drops down to 42.1 km/s 94,000 mph at earths distance from the sun 1 au and 4.21 km/s 9,400 mph at a distance of 100 au.nnnpropulsion stageseditn a star-48 rocket motor like the one used to launch the new horizons probenevery planetary probe was placed into its escape trajectory by a multistage rocket the last stage of which ends up on nearly the same trajectory as the probe it launched because these stages cannot be actively guided their trajectories are now different from the probes they launched the probes were guided with small thrusters that allow course changes however in cases where the spacecraft acquired escape velocity because of a gravity assist the stages may not have a similar course and there is the remote possibility that they collided with something some objects in heliocentric orbit have been reidentified with a telescope and so their trajectories can be confirmed the stages on an escape trajectory are:nnnin addition two small yo-yo de-spin weights on wires were used to reduce the spin of the new horizons probe prior to its release from the third-stage rocket once the spin rate was lowered these masses and the wires were released and so are also on an escape trajectory out of the solar system none of these objects are trackable they have no power or radio antennae spin uncontrollably and are too small to be detected and their exact positions are unknowable beyond their projected solar system escape trajectories.nthe third stage of pioneer 11 is thought to be in solar orbit because its encounter with jupiter would not have resulted in escape from the solar system pioneer 11 gained the required velocity to escape the solar system in its subsequent encounter with saturn.nthe only objects to date to be launched directly into a solar escape trajectory were the new horizons spacecraft its third stage and the two de-spin masses the new horizons centaur second stage is not escaping it is in a 2.83-year heliocentric solar orbit.nthe pioneer 10 and 11 and voyager 1 and 2 centaur second stages are also in heliocentric orbits.nin order to leave the solar system the probe needs to reach the escape velocity after leaving earth the suns escape velocity is 42.1 km/s in order to reach this speed it is highly advantageous to use the orbital speed of the earth around the sun which is 29.78 km/s by passing near a planet a probe can gain extra speed.non january 19 2006 the new horizons spacecraft to pluto was launched directly into a solar-escape trajectory at 16.26 kilometers per second 58,536 km/h 36,373 mph from cape canaveral using an atlas v version with 5 of the aj-60a srbs and the common core booster centaur upper stage and star 48b third stage new horizons passed the moons orbit in just nine hours.npropulsive units for new horizons which was launched directly to a solar escape velocity from earth:nnngalleryeditnnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnexternal
