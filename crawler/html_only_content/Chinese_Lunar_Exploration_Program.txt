chinese lunar exploration program wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnthe chinese lunar exploration program clep chinese pinyin zhnggu tnyu also known as the change project chinese pinyin chng gngchng after the chinese moon goddess change is an ongoing series of robotic moon missions by the china national space administration cnsa the program incorporates lunar orbiters landers rovers and sample return spacecraft launched using long march rockets launches and flights are monitored by a telemetry tracking and command tt&c system which uses 50-metre 160-foot radio antennas in beijing and 40-metre 130-foot antennas in kunming shanghai and rmqi to form a 3,000-kilometre 1,900-mile vlbi antenna a proprietary ground application system is responsible for downlink data reception.nouyang ziyuan a geologist and chemical cosmologist was among the first to advocate the exploitation not only of known lunar reserves of metals such as titanium but also of helium-3 an ideal fuel for future nuclear fusion power plants he currently serves as the chief scientist of the chinese lunar exploration program another scientist sun jiadong was assigned as the general designer while scientist sun zezhou was assigned as the deputy general designer the leading program manager is luan enjie.nthe first spacecraft of the program the change 1 lunar orbiter was launched from xichang satellite launch center on 24 october 2007 having been delayed from the initial planned date of 1719 april 2007 a second orbiter change 2 was launched on 1 october 2010 change 3 which includes a lander and rover was launched on 1 december 2013 and successfully soft-landed on the moon on 14 december 2013 change 4 which includes a lander and rover was launched on 7 december 2018 a sample return mission change 5 is scheduled for december 2019.nas indicated by the official insignia the shape of a calligraphic nascent lunar crescent with two human footprints at its center reminiscent of the chinese character the chinese character for month which is shorthand for moon the ultimate objective of the program is to pave the way for a manned mission to the moon such a mission may occur in 20252030.nncontentsnnnprogram structureeditnthe chinese lunar exploration program is divided into four main operational phases with each mission serving as a technology demonstrator in preparation for future missions international cooperation in the form of various payloads and a robotic station is invited by china.nn the change 5-t1 test vehicle service module took this photo of earth and the moon together on november 9 2014 the service module carrying the camera in 540,000 km from earth at a distance of 920,000 kilometers moon shot clear of the earth-moon photo images a week after successfully returning the sample capsule the moons surface is quite dark compared to earths bright clouds.nphase i orbital missionseditnthe first phase entailed the launch of two lunar orbiters and is now effectively complete.nnnphase ii soft landers/roverseditnthe second phase is ongoing and incorporates spacecraft capable of soft-landing on the moon and deploying lunar rovers.nnnphase iii sample-returneditnthe third phase will entail a lunar sample-return mission.nnnphase iv lunar research stationeditndevelopment of a robotic research station near the moons south pole.nnncrewed missioneditnas of 2019 china was reviewing preliminary studies for a crewed lunar landing mission in the 2030s and possibly build an outpost near the lunar south pole with international cooperation.nnkey technologieseditnnlong-range tt&ceditnthe biggest challenge in phase i of the program was the operation of the tt&c system because its transmission capability needed sufficient range to communicate with the probes in lunar orbit chinas standard satellite telemetry had a range of 80,000 km 50,000 mi but the distance between the moon and the earth can exceed 400,000 km 250,000 mi when the moon is at apogee in addition the change probes had to carry out many attitude maneuvers during their flights to the moon and during operations in lunar orbit the distance across china from east to west is 5,000 km 3,100 mi forming another challenge to tt&c continuity at present the combination of the tt&c system and the chinese astronomical observation network has met the needs of the change program but only by a small margin.nnenvironmental adaptabilityeditnthe complexity of the space environment encountered during the change missions imposed strict requirements for environmental adaptability and reliability of the probes and their instruments the high-radiation environment in earth-moon space required hardened electronics to prevent electromagnetic damage to spacecraft instruments the extreme temperature range from 130 c 266 f on the side of the spacecraft facing the sun to 170 c 274 f on the side facing away from the sun imposed strict requirements for temperature control in the design of the detectors.nnorbit design and flight sequence controleditngiven the conditions of the three-body system of the earth moon and a space probe the orbit design of lunar orbiters is more complicated than that of earth-orbiting satellites which only deal with a two-body system the change 1 and change 2 probes were first sent into highly elliptical earth orbits after separating from their launch vehicles they entered an earth-moon transfer orbit through three accelerations in the phase-modulated orbit these accelerations were conducted 16 24 and 48 hours into the missions during which several orbit adjustments and attitude maneuvers were carried out so as to ensure the probes capture by lunar gravity after operating in the earth-moon orbit for 45 days each probe entered a lunar acquisition orbit after entering their target orbits conducting three braking maneuvers and experiencing three different orbit phases change 1 and change 2 carried out their missions.nnattitude controleditnlunar orbiters have to remain properly oriented with respect to the earth moon and sun all onboard detectors must be kept facing the lunar surface in order to complete their scientific missions communication antennas have to face the earth in order to receive commands and transfer scientific data and solar panels must be oriented toward the sun in order to acquire power during lunar orbit the earth the moon and the sun also move so attitude control is a complex three-vector control process the change satellites need to adjust their attitude very carefully to maintain an optimal angle towards all three bodies.nnhazard avoidanceeditnduring the second phase of the program in which the spacecraft were required to soft-land on the lunar surface it was necessary to devise a system of automatic hazard avoidance in order that the landers would not attempt to touch down on unsuitable terrain change 3 utilized a computer vision system in which the data from a down-facing camera as well as 2 ranging devices were processed using specialized software the software controlled the final stages of descent adjusting the attitude of the spacecraft and the throttle of its main engine the spacecraft hovered first at 100 metres 330 ft then at 30 metres 98 ft as it searched for a suitable spot to set down the yutu rover is also equipped with front-facing stereo cameras and hazard avoidance technology.nncooperation with russiaeditnin november 2017 china and russia signed an agreement on cooperative lunar and deep space exploration the agreement includes six sectors covering lunar and deep space joint spacecraft development space electronics earth remote sensing data and space debris monitoring russia may also look to develop closer ties with china in human spaceflight and even shift its human spaceflight cooperation from the us to china and build a crewed lunar lander.nnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
