bold hypothesis wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnbold hypothesis or bold conjecture is a concept in the philosophy of science of karl popper first explained in his debut the logic of scientific discovery 1935 and subsequently elaborated in writings such as conjectures and refutations the growth of scientific knowledge 1963 the concept is nowadays widely used in the philosophy of science and in the philosophy of knowledge it is also used in the social and behavioural sciences.nncontentsnnnbrief explanationeditnpoppers argument is that the growth of scientific knowledge progresses by means of formulating bold hypotheses and trying to refute disprove or falsify them popper believed that:nn"bold ideas unjustified anticipations and speculative thought are our only means for interpreting nature our only organon our only instrument for grasping her."nnhe makes this point more specific in a 1953 lecture where he argues that if we aim to explain the world then:nn there is no more rational procedure than the method of trial and error of conjecture and refutation of boldly proposing theories of trying our best to show that these are erroneous and of accepting them tentatively if our critical efforts are unsuccessful from the point of view here developed all laws all theories remain essentially tentative or conjectural or hypothetical even when we feel unable to doubt them any longer."nna bold hypothesis is a new scientific idea which if it was true would be able to predict and/or explain a lot or a lot more about the subject being theorized about the boldness of a hypothesis depends mainly on:nnnonce a bold hypothesis has been mooted popper argues scientists try to investigate and test how well the bold hypothesis can stand up to the known evidence with the aim of finding counter-arguments which would refute or falsify the bold hypothesis in this process of testing and criticism new scientific knowledge is generated even if the bold hypothesis turns out to have been wrong testing it generates new knowledge about what can and cannot be the case often it stimulates new research.ninversely if a hypothesis lacks the quality of boldness then it would make very little difference to what scientists already know it is not a big deal i.e it is not very significant for the theory which exists already it can contribute rather little to advancing scientific progress because it does not expand or add to scientific understanding very much.naccording to popper,nn"science does not rest upon solid bedrock the bold structure of its theories rises as it were above a swamp it is like a building erected on piles the piles are driven down from above into the swamp but not down to any natural or given base and if we stop driving the piles deeper it is not because we have reached firm ground we simply stop when we are satisfied that the piles are firm enough to carry the structure at least for the time being nnin poppers philosophy of science scientific statements are always provisional they have limits of application and they could always be wrong if a statement cannot even in principle be proved wrong it cannot be a scientific statement thus in poppers eyes the falsifiability criterion clearly demarcates science from non-science this popperian idea has been very controversial however the reason is that it can be quite difficult to test scientifically how true a particular idea is even if scientists do want to test an idea they may not know yet how exactly to test it conclusively yet scientists also dont want to abandon a hunch that seems useful simply because they dont know how to verify it yet this point is especially important for bold new hypotheses because the very boldness of the new hypothesis could mean that it would take a lot of work before adequate tests could be designed.nsome philosophers have argued that in the real world scientists operate routinely with at least some metaphysical beliefs for which they have no proof or verification whatsoever according to paul feyerabend the creative processes that lead to a scientific discovery are usually quite reasonable and non-arbitrary however the creative processes are by no means fully rational and they can be quite unique thus the idea that there is one standard model which can define the rationality of all scientific methods should be rejected.nin one of his later writings objective knowledge 1972 popper argued that:nn"a theory is the bolder the greater its content it is also the riskier it is the more probable to start with that it will be false we try to find its weak points to refute it if we fail to refute it or if the refutations we find are at the same time also refutations of the weaker theory which was its predecessor then we have reason to suspect or to conjecture that the stronger theory has no greater falsity content than its weaker predecessor and therefore that it has the greater degree of verisimilitude".nnthis interpretation was criticized by adolf grnbaum.nnmain criticismseditnpoppers idea of the role of bold hypotheses in scientific progress has attracted three main kinds of criticisms.nnndespite these important criticisms poppers concept of bold hypotheses continues to be widely used in the academic world one reason is that at some level the concept does make sense even if arguably popper himself failed to define its role in scientific research very well another reason is that academic progress always requires that a scholar does something genuinely new and breaks new ground if a scholar only concerns himself with tiny uncontroversial and fairly trivial claims he is unlikely to be rewarded very much for his effort plausible and credible bold hypotheses are highly valued in the academic world so long as they are reasonably consistent with well-established scientific findings and do not seriously challenge scientific authority nin the business community too innovation is very important to find new ways to reduce costs increase sales and increase profits a bold new idea can be worth a lot of money and therefore business people are often sympathetic to bold attempts to reframe what is known already and to create new ideas without such innovations they would eventually be defeated by competitors who have a better idea so the idea of a bold hypothesis also continues to have a place in economics management theory and business administration.nnsee alsoeditnnnotes and referenceseditnnnnnnn ncategories n
