exploration to little-charted areas east of the cape of good hope west of staten land near cape horn south america and south of the solomon islands.none of the objectives was to obtain knowledge of all the totally unknown provinces of beach a purported yet non-existent landmass with plentiful gold which had appeared on european maps since the 15th century as a result of an error in some editions of marco polos works see the box right for more information.nthis expedition was to use two small ships heemskerck and zeehaen.nnmauritiuseditnin accordance with visschers directions tasman sailed from batavia on 14 august 1642 and arrived at mauritius on 5 september 1642 according to the captains journal the reason for this was the crew could be fed well on the island there was plenty of fresh water and timber to repair the ships tasman got the assistance of the governor adriaan van der stel.nbecause of the prevailing winds mauritius was chosen as a turning point after a four-week stay on the island both ships left on 8 october using the roaring forties to sail east as fast as possible no one had gone as far as pieter nuyts in 1626/27 on 7 november snow and hail influenced the ships council to alter course to a more north-eastern direction expecting to arrive one day at the solomon islands.nntasmaniaeditn coastal cliffs of tasman peninsulanon 24 november 1642 abel tasman reached and sighted the west coast of tasmania north of macquarie harbour he named his discovery van diemens land after antonio van diemen governor-general of the dutch east indies.nproceeding south tasman skirted the southern end of tasmania and turned north-east he then tried to work his two ships into adventure bay on the east coast of south bruny island where he was blown out to sea by a storm this area he named storm bay two days later tasman anchored to the north of cape frederick hendrick just north of the forestier peninsula tasman then landed in blackman bay in the larger marion bay the next day an attempt was made to land in north bay however because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the dutch flag tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 december 1642.nfor two more days he continued to follow the east coast northward to see how far it went when the land veered to the north-west at eddystone point he tried to keep in with it but his ships were suddenly hit by the roaring forties howling through banks strait the impenetrable wind wall indicated that here was a strait not a bay tasman was on a mission to find the southern continent not more islands so he abruptly turned away to the east and continued his continent-hunting.nnnew zealandeditn murderers bay drawing by isaack gilsemansn mori hakanafter some exploration tasman had intended to proceed in a northerly direction but as the wind was unfavourable he steered east the expedition endured an extremely rough voyage and in one of his diary entries tasman credited his compass claiming it was the only thing that had kept him alive.non 13 december 1642 they sighted land on the north-west coast of the south island new zealand becoming the first europeans to do so tasman named it staten landt in honour of the states general dutch parliament he wrote it is possible that this land joins to the staten land but it is uncertain referring to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of south america discovered by jacob le maire in 1616 he continued we believe that this is the mainland coast of the unknown southland tasman thought he had found the western side of the long-imagined terra australis that stretched across the pacific to near the southern tip of south america.nnafter sailing north then east for five days the expedition anchored about 7 km from the coast off what is now believed to have been golden bay tasman sent ships boats to gather water but one of his boats was attacked by mori in a double hulled waka canoe and four of his men were killed with mere clubs in the evening about one hour after sunset we saw many lights on land and four vessels near the shore two of which betook themselves towards us when our two boats returned to the ships reporting that they had found not less than thirteen fathoms of water and with the sinking of the sun which sank behind the high land they had been still about half a mile from the shore after our people had been on board about one glass people in the two canoes began to call out to us in gruff hollow voices we could not in the least understand any of it however when they called out again several times we called back to them as a token answer but they did not come nearer than a stones shot they also blew many times on an instrument which produced a sound like the moors trumpets we had one of our sailors who could play somewhat on the trumpet play some tunes to them in answer."n as tasman sailed out of the bay he observed 22 waka near the shore of which eleven swarming with people came off towards us the waka approached the zeehaen which fired and hit a man in the largest waka holding a small white flag canister shot also hit the side of a waka archeological research has shown the dutch had tried to land at a major agricultural area which the mori may have been trying to protect tasman named the area murderers bay".nthe expedition then sailed north sighting cook strait which it mistook for a bight and named zeehaens bight two names that the expedition gave to landmarks in the far north of new zealand still endure cape maria van diemen and three kings islands kaap pieter boreels was renamed cape egmont by captain james cook 125 years later.nnreturn voyageeditn tongatapu the main island of tonga drawing by isaack gilsemansn

came close to being wrecked on the dangerous reefs of the north-eastern part of the fiji group he charted the eastern tip of vanua levu and cikobia before making his way back into the open sea.nthe expedition turned north-west towards new guinea and arrived at batavia on 15 june 1643.nnsecond major voyageeditntasman left batavia on 30 january 1644 on his second voyage with three ships limmen zeemeeuw and the tender braek he followed the south coast of new guinea eastwards in an attempt to find a passage to the eastern side of new holland however he missed the torres strait between new guinea and australia probably due to the numerous reefs and islands obscuring potential routes and continued his voyage by following the shore of the gulf of carpentaria westwards along the north australian coast he mapped the north coast of australia making observations on new holland and its people he arrived back in batavia in august 1644.nfrom the point of view of the dutch east india company tasmans explorations were a disappointment he had neither found a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route although received modestly the company was upset to a degree that tasman did not fully explore the lands he found and decided that a more persistent explorer should be chosen for any future expeditions for over a century until the era of james cook tasmania and new zealand were not visited by europeans mainland australia was visited but usually only by accident.nnlater lifeeditnon 2 november 1644 abel tasman was appointed a member of the council of justice at batavia he went to sumatra in 1646 and in august 1647 to siam now thailand with letters from the company to the king in may 1648 he was in charge of an expedition sent to manila to try to intercept and loot the spanish silver ships coming from america but he had no success and returned to batavia in january 1649 in november 1649 he was charged and found guilty of having in the previous year hanged one of his men without trial was suspended from his office of commander fined and made to pay compensation to the relatives of the sailor on 5 january 1651 he was formally reinstated in his rank and spent his remaining years at batavia he was in good circumstances being one of the larger landowners in the town he died at batavia on 10 october 1659 and was survived by his second wife and a daughter by his first wife his property was divided between his wife and his daughter by his first marriage in his testimony dating from 1657 he left 25 guilders to the poor of his village lutjegast.nalthough tasmans pilot frans visscher published memoir concerning the discovery of the south land in 1642 tasmans detailed journal was not published until 1898 however some of his charts and maps were in general circulation and used by subsequent explorers.nnlegacyeditntasmans ten-month voyage in 1642-43 had significant consequences by circumnavigating australia albeit at a distance tasman proved that the small fifth continent was not joined to any larger sixth continent such as the long-imagined southern continent further tasmans suggestion that new zealand was the western side of that southern continent was seized upon by many european cartographers who for the next century depicted new zealand as the west coast of a terra australis rising gradually from the waters around tierra del fuego this theory was eventually disproved when captain cook circumnavigated new zealand in 1769.nnn abel tasman national parknmultiple places have been named after tasman including:nnnalso

wales vestibule showing the tasman mapnheld within the collection of the state library of new south wales is the tasman map thought to have been drawn by isaac gilsemans or completed under the supervision of franz jacobszoon visscher the map is also known as the bonaparte map as it was once owned by prince roland bonaparte the great-nephew of napoleon the map was completed sometime after 1644 and is based on the original charts drawn during tasmans first and second voyages as none of the journals or logs composed during tasmans second voyage have survived the bonaparte map remains as an important contemporary artefact of tasmans voyage to the northern coast of the australian continent.nthe tasman map largely reveals the extent of understanding the dutch had of the australian continent at the time the map includes the western and southern coasts of australia accidentally encountered by dutch voyagers as they journeyed by way of the cape of good hope to the voc headquarters in batavia in addition the map shows the tracks of tasmans two voyages of his second voyage the map shows the area of the banda islands the southern coast of new guinea and much of the northern coast of australia however the area of the torres strait is shown unexamined this is despite having been given orders by voc council at batavia to explore the possibility of a channel between new guinea and the australian continent.nthere is debate as to the origin of the map it is widely believed that the map was produced in batavia however it has also been argued that the map was produced in amsterdam the authorship of the map has also been debated while the map is commonly attributed to tasman it is now thought to have been the result of a collaboration probably involving franchoijs visscher and isaack gilseman who took part in both of tasmans voyages whether the map was produced in 1644 is also subject to debate as a voc company report in december 1644 suggests that at that time no maps showing tasmans voyages were yet complete.nin 1943 a mosaic version of the map composed of coloured marble and brass was inlaid into the vestibule floor of the mitchell library in sydney the work was commissioned by the principal librarian william ifould and completed by the melocco brothers of annandale who also worked on anzac war memorial in hyde park and the crypt at st marys cathedral sydney.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnsourceseditnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
