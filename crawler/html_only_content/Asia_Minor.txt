aegean sea to the west the sea of marmara forms a connection between the black and aegean seas through the bosphorus and dardanelles straits and separates anatolia from thrace on the european mainland.nthe eastern border of anatolia is traditionally held to be a line between the gulf of alexandretta and the black sea bounded by the armenian highland to the east and mesopotamia to the southeast thus traditionally anatolia is the territory that comprises approximately the western two-thirds of the asian part of turkey nowadays anatolia is also often considered to be synonymous with asian turkey which comprises almost the entire country its eastern and southeastern borders are widely taken to be turkeys eastern border by some definitions the area called the armenian highlands lies beyond the boundary of the anatolian plateau the official name of this inland region is the eastern anatolia region.nthe ancient inhabitants of anatolia spoke the now-extinct anatolian languages which were largely replaced by the greek language starting from classical antiquity and during the hellenistic roman and byzantine periods major anatolian languages included hittite luwian and lydian among other more poorly attested relatives the turkification of anatolia began under the seljuk empire in the late 11th century and continued under the ottoman empire between the late 13th and early

vazken davidian terms the expanded use of anatolia to apply to territory formerly referred to as armenia an ahistorical imposition and notes that a growing body of literature is uncomfortable with

name the greeks used for the anatolian peninsula asa presumably echoed the name of the assuwa league in western anatolia as the name asia broadened its scope to apply to other areas east of the mediterranean greeks in late antiquity came to use the name mikr asa or asia minor meaning lesser asia to refer to present-day anatolia.nthe english-language name anatolia itself derives from the greek anatol meaning the east or more literally sunrise comparable to the latin-derived terms levant and orient the precise reference of this term has varied over time perhaps originally referring to the aeolian ionian and dorian colonies on the west coast of asia minor in the byzantine empire the anatolic theme was a theme covering the western and central parts of turkeys present-day central

empire mapmakers outside the empire referred to the mountainous plateau in eastern anatolia as armenia other contemporary sources called the same area kurdistan geographers have variously used the terms east anatolian plateau and armenian plateau to refer to the region although the territory encompassed by each term largely overlaps with the other according to archaeologist lori khatchadourian this difference in terminology primarily results from the shifting political fortunes and cultural trajectories of the region since the nineteenth century."nturkeys first geography congress in 1941 created two regions to the east of the gulf of iskenderun-black sea line named the eastern anatolia region and the southeastern anatolia region the former largely corresponding to the western part of the armenian highland the latter to the northern part of the mesopotamian plain according to richard hovannisian this changing of toponyms was necessary to obscure all evidence of armenian presence as part of a campaign of genocide denial embarked upon by the newly established turkish government and what hovannisian calls its foreign collaborators".nnhistoryeditnmain article history of

and hurrians the hattians spoke a language of unclear affiliation and the hurrian language belongs to a small family called hurro-urartian all these languages now being extinct relationships with indigenous languages of the caucasus have been proposed but are not generally accepted the region was famous for exporting raw materials and areas of hattian and hurrian-populated southeast anatolia

there displacing earlier palaic-speaking indo-europeans much of the history of the hittite empire concerned war with the rival empires of egypt assyria and the mitanni.nthe egyptians eventually withdrew from the region after failing to gain the upper hand over the hittites and becoming wary of the power of assyria which had destroyed the mitanni empire the assyrians and hittites were then
