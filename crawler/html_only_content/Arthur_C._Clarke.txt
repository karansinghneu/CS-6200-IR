york city in 1964 to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project as the idea developed they decided to loosely base the story on clarkes short story the sentinel written in 1948 as an entry in a bbc short story competition originally clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film but kubrick suggested during one of their brainstorming meetings that before beginning on the actual script they should let their imaginations soar free by writing a novel first on which they would base the film this is more or less the way it worked out though toward the end novel and screenplay were being written simultaneously with feedback in both directions thus i rewrote some sections after seeing the movie rushesa rather expensive method of literary creation which few other authors can have enjoyed the novel ended up being published a few months after the release of the movie.ndue to the hectic schedule of the films production kubrick and clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of 1964 with the plan to publish in 1965 in advance of the films release in 1966 after many delays the film was released in the spring of 1968 before the book was completed the book was credited to clarke alone clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a novelisation that kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay clarkes authorship for these and other reasons the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie the film contains little explanation for the events taking place clarke on the other hand wrote thorough explanations of cause and effect for the events in the novel james randi later recounted that upon seeing the premiere of 2001 clarke left the theatre at the intermission in tears after having watched an eleven-minute scene which did not make it into general release where an astronaut is doing nothing more than jogging inside the spaceship which was kubricks idea of showing the audience how boring space travels could be.nin 1972 clarke published the lost worlds of 2001 which included his accounts of the production and alternative versions of key scenes the special edition of the novel a space odyssey released in 1999 contains an introduction by clarke in which he documents the events leading to the release of the novel and film.nn2010 odyssey twoeditnin 1982 clarke continued the 2001 epic with a sequel 2010 odyssey two this novel was also made into a film 2010 directed by peter hyams for release in 1984 because of the political environment in america in the 1980s the film presents a cold war theme with the looming tensions of nuclear warfare not featured in the novel the film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as 2001 but the reviews were still positive.nclarkes email correspondence with hyams was published in 1984 titled the odyssey file the making of 2010 and co-authored with hyams it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium of email and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film while living on opposite sides of the world the book also included clarkes personal list of the best science-fiction films ever made.nclarke appeared in the film first as the man feeding the pigeons while dr heywood floyd is engaged in a conversation in front of the white house later in the hospital scene with david bowmans mother an image of the cover of time portrays clarke as the american president and kubrick as the soviet premier.nnrendezvous with ramaeditnclarkes award-winning novel rendezvous with rama 1973 was optioned for filmmaking in the early 21st century but this motion picture is in development hell as of 2014 in the early 2000s the actor morgan freeman expressed his desire to produce a movie based on rendezvous with rama after a drawn-out development process which freeman attributed to difficulties in getting financing it appeared that in 2003 this project might be proceeding but this is very dubious the film was to be produced by freemans production company revelations entertainment and david fincher has been touted on revelations rama web page as far back as 2001 as the films director after years of no progress fincher stated in an interview in late 2007 in which he also credited the novel as being influential on the films alien and star trek the motion picture that he is still attached to helm revelations indicated that stel pavlou had written the adaptation.nin late 2008 fincher stated the movie is unlikely to be made it looks like its not going to happen theres no script and as you know morgan freemans not in the best of health right now weve been trying to do it but its probably not going to happen however in 2010 it was announced that the film was still planned for future production and both freeman and fincher mentioned it as still needing a worthy script.nnscience writereditnclarke published a number of non-fiction books with essays speeches addresses etc several of his non-fiction books are composed of chapters that can stand on their own as separate essays.nnspace traveleditnin particular clarke was a populariser of the concept of space travel in 1950 he wrote interplanetary flight a book outlining the basics of space flight for laymen later books about space travel included the exploration of space 1951 the challenge of the spaceship 1959 voices from the sky 1965 the promise of space 1968 rev ed 1970 and report on planet three 1972 among others.nnfuturismeditnhis books on space travel usually included chapters about other aspects of science and technology such as computers and bioengineering he predicted telecommunication satellites albeit serviced by astronauts in space suits who would replace the satellites vacuum tubes as they burned out.nhis many predictions culminated in 1958 when he began a series of magazine essays that eventually became profiles of the future published in book form in 1962 a timetable up to the year 2100 describes inventions and ideas including such things as a global library for 2005 the same work also contained clarkes first law and text that became clarkes three laws in later editions.nin a 1959 essay clarke predicted global satellite tv broadcasts that would cross national boundaries indiscriminately and would bring hundreds of channels available anywhere in the world he also envisioned a personal transceiver so small and compact that every man carries one he wrote the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on earth merely by dialling a number such a device would also in clarkes vision include means for global positioning so that no one need ever again be lost later in profiles of the future he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s.nnplay media 1974 abc interview with clarke in which he describes a future of ubiquitous computing reminiscent of the modern internetnin a 1974 interview with the australian broadcasting corporation the interviewer asked clarke how he believed the computer would change the future for the everyday person and what life would be like in the year 2001 clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality including online banking online shopping and other now commonplace things responding to a question about how the interviewers sons life would be different clarke responded he will have in his own house not a computer as big as this points to nearby computer but at least a console through which he can talk through his friendly local computer and get all the information he needs for his everyday life like his bank statements his theatre reservations all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society this will be in a compact form in his own house and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone."nan extensive selection of clarkes essays and book chapters from 1934 to 1998 110 pieces 63 of them previously uncollected in his books can be found in the book greetings carbon-based bipeds 2000 together with a new introduction and many prefatory notes another collection of essays all previously collected is by space possessed 1993 clarkes technical papers together with several essays and extensive autobiographical material are collected in ascent to orbit a scientific autobiography 1984.nngeostationary communications satelliteeditn geostationary or clarke orbitnmain article geostationary orbitnclarke contributed to the popularity of the idea that geostationary satellites would be ideal telecommunications relays he first described this in a letter to the editor of wireless world in february 1945 and elaborated on the concept in a paper titled extra-terrestrial relays can rocket stations give worldwide radio coverage published in wireless world in october 1945 the geostationary orbit is now sometimes known as the clarke orbit or the clarke belt in his honour.nit is not clear that this article was actually the inspiration for the modern telecommunications satellite according to john r pierce of bell labs who was involved in the echo satellite and telstar projects he gave a talk upon the subject in 1954 published in 1955 using ideas that were in the air but was not aware of clarkes article at the time in an interview given shortly before his death clarke was asked whether he had ever suspected that one day communications satellites would become so important he replied:nnim often asked why i didnt try to patent the idea of a communications satellite my answer is always a patent is really a license to be sued.nnthough different from clarkes idea of telecom relay the idea of communicating via satellites in geostationary orbit itself had been described earlier for example the concept of geostationary satellites was described in hermann oberths 1923 book die rakete zu den planetenrumen the rocket into interplanetary space and then the idea of radio communication by means of those satellites in herman potoniks written under the pseudonym hermann noordung 1928 book das problem der befahrung des weltraums der raketen-motor the problem of space travel the rocket motor sections providing for long distance communications and safety and possibly referring to the idea of relaying messages via satellite but not that 3 would be optimal observing and researching the earths surface published in berlin clarke acknowledged the earlier concept in his book profiles of the future.nnundersea explorereditnclarke was an avid scuba diver and a member of the underwater explorers club in addition to writing clarke set up several diving-related ventures with his business partner mike wilson in 1956 while scuba diving wilson and clarke uncovered ruined masonry architecture and idol images of the sunken original koneswaram temple including carved columns with flower insignias and stones in the form of elephant heads spread on the shallow surrounding seabed other discoveries included chola bronzes from the original shrine and these discoveries were described in clarkes 1957 book the reefs of taprobane in 1961 while filming off great basses reef wilson found a wreck and retrieved silver coins plans to dive on the wreck the following year were stopped when clarke developed paralysis ultimately diagnosed as polio a year later clarke observed the salvage from the shore and the surface the ship ultimately identified as belonging to the mughal emperor aurangzeb yielded fused bags of silver rupees cannon and other artefacts carefully documented became the basis for the treasure of the great reef living in sri lanka and learning its history also inspired the backdrop for his novel the fountains of paradise in which he described a space elevator this he believed would make rocket-based access to space obsolete and more than geostationary satellites would ultimately be his scientific legacy.nnviewseditnon religioneditnthemes of religion and spirituality appear in much of clarkes writing he said any path to knowledge is a path to godor reality whichever word one prefers to use he described himself as fascinated by the concept of god j b s haldane near the end of his life suggested in a personal letter to clarke that clarke should receive a prize in theology for being one of the few people to write anything new on the subject and went on to say that if clarkes writings did not contain multiple contradictory theological views he might have been a menace when he entered the royal air force clarke insisted that his dog tags be marked pantheist rather than the default church of england and in a 1991 essay entitled credo described himself as a logical positivist from the age of ten in 2000 clarke told the sri lankan newspaper the island i dont believe in god or an afterlife and he identified himself as an atheist he was honoured as a humanist laureate in the international academy of humanism he has also described himself as a crypto-buddhist insisting that buddhism is not a religion he displayed little interest about religion early in his life for example only discovering a few months after marrying that his wife had strong presbyterian beliefs.na famous quotation of clarkes is often cited one of the great tragedies of mankind is that morality has been hijacked by religion he was quoted in popular science in 2004 as saying of religion most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses we should get rid of it as quick as we can in a three-day dialogue on man and his world with alan watts clarke stated that he was biased against religion and said that he could not forgive religions for what he perceived as their inability to prevent atrocities and wars over time in his introduction to the penultimate episode of mysterious world entitled strange skies clarke said i sometimes think that the universe is a machine designed for the perpetual astonishment of astronomers reflecting the dialogue of the episode in which he stated this concept more broadly referring to mankind near the very end of that same episode the last segment of which covered the star of bethlehem he said that his favourite theory was that it might be a pulsar given that pulsars were discovered in the interval between his writing the short story the star 1955 and making mysterious world 1980 and given the more recent discovery of pulsar psr b1913+16 he said how romantic if even now we can hear the dying voice of a star which heralded the christian era."nclarke left written instructions for a funeral that stated absolutely no religious rites of any kind relating to any religious faith should be associated with my funeral."nnpoliticseditnregarding freedom of information clarke believed in the struggle for freedom nof information technology not politics will be the ultimate decider".nclarke also wrote it is not easy to see how the more extreme forms of nationalism can nlong survive when men have seen the earth in its true perspective as a single small nglobe against the stars."nregarding human jobs being replaced by robots clarke said any teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be!"nclarke supported the use of renewable energy saying i would like to see us kick our current addiction to oil and adopt clean energy sources climate change has now added a new sense of urgency our civilisation depends on energy but we cant allow oil and coal to slowly bake our planet."nnintelligent lifeeditnclarke believed the best proof that theres intelligent life in outer space is the fact that it hasnt come nhere...the fact that we have not yet found the slightest evidencenfor life much less intelligence beyond this earth does not surprise or disappoint nme in the least our technology must still be laughably primitive we may well be like njungle savages listening for the throbbing of tom-toms while the ether around them ncarries more words per second than they could utter in a lifetime"nclarke also believed two possibilities nexist either we are alone in the universe or we are not both are equally terrifying."nnparanormal phenomenaeditnearly in his career clarke had a fascination with the paranormal and stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel childhoods end citing the numerous promising paranormal claims that were shown to be fraudulent clarke described his earlier openness to the paranormal having turned to being an almost total sceptic by the time of his 1992 biography during interviews both in 1993 and 20042005 he stated that he did not believe in reincarnation saying that there was no
