zond program wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnzond russian for probe was the name given to two distinct series of soviet unmanned space program undertaken from 1964 to 1970 the first series based on the 3mv planetary probe was intended to gather information about nearby planets the second series of test spacecraft being a precursor to manned circumlunar loop flights used a stripped-down variant of soyuz spacecraft consisting of the service and descent modules but lacking the orbital module two tortoises and other lifeforms aboard zond 5 were the first to travel around the moon and return to earth.nncontentsnnnmissions based on the 3mv planetary probeeditn zond 2 interplanetary part of 3mv familynmain article 3mv planetary probenthe first three missions were based on the model 3mv planetary probe intended to explore venus and mars after two failures zond 3 was sent on a test mission becoming the second spacecraft to photograph the far side of the moon it then continued out to the orbit of mars in order to test telemetry and spacecraft systems.nncircumlunar missionseditnmain articles soyuz 7k-l1 and moon race onward to the moonnthe missions 4 through 8 were test flights under for the soviet moonshot during the moon race the soyuz 7k-l1 also mentioned just as l1 spacecraft was used for the moon-aimed missions stripped down to make it possible to launch around the moon from the earth they were launched on the proton rocket which was just powerful enough to send the zond on a free return trajectory around the moon without going into lunar orbit the type path that apollo 13 flew in its emergency abort with minor modification zond was capable of carrying two cosmonauts.nin the beginning there were serious reliability problems with both the new proton rocket and the similarly new soyuz spacecraft but the test flights pressed ahead with some glitches the majority of test flights from 19671970 zond 4 to zond 8 showed problems during re-entry.nthe zond spacecraft made only unmanned automatic flights four of these suffered malfunctions that would have injured or killed any crew instrumentation flown on these missions gathered data on micrometeor flux solar and cosmic rays magnetic fields radio emissions and solar wind many photographs were taken and biological payloads were also flown.nntimetableeditn3mv planetary probe based missionseditnnsoyuz 7k-l1/l1s test missionseditnnphotoseditnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
