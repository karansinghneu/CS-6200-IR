geocentric orbit wikipedia n redirected from earth orbitn jump to navigationnjump to searchnfor the motion of earth around the sun see earths orbit for the shuttle simulator see space cadets tv series simulator.nna geocentric orbit or earth orbit involves any object orbiting planet earth such as the moon or artificial satellites in 1997 nasa estimated there were approximately 2,465 artificial satellite payloads orbiting the earth and 6,216 pieces of space debris as tracked by the goddard space flight center over 16,291 previously launched objects have decayed into the earths atmosphere.na spacecraft enters orbit when its centripetal acceleration due to gravity is less than or equal to the centrifugal acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity for a low earth orbit this velocity is about 7,800 m/s 28,100 km/h 17,400 mph by contrast the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft was 2,200 m/s 7,900 km/h 4,900 mph in 1967 by the north american x-15 the energy required to reach earth orbital velocity at an altitude of 600 km 370 mi is about 36 mj/kg which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.nspacecraft with a perigee below about 2,000 km 1,200 mi are subject to drag from the earths atmosphere which decreases the orbital altitude the rate of orbital decay depends on the satellites cross-sectional area and mass as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere below about 300 km 190 mi decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days once a satellite descends to 180 km 110 mi it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere the escape velocity required to pull free of earths gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about 11,200 m/s 40,300 km/h 25,100 mph.nncontentsnnnlist of terms and conceptseditnthe following words may have more than one definition or other non-earth specific definitions.in the spirit of brevity some of the definitions have been altered or truncated to reflect only their usage on this page.nnnnnnnnnnnnnnngeocentric orbit typeseditnthe following is a list of different geocentric orbit classifications.nnaltitude classificationseditn low cyan and medium yellow earth orbit regions to scale the black dashed line is the geosynchronous orbit the green dashed line is the 20,230 km orbit used for gps satellites.nnnnninclination classificationseditnnnneccentricity classificationseditnnnnnnnnnndirectional classificationseditnngeosynchronous classificationseditnnnnnnnnnnnspecial classificationseditnnnnon-geocentric classificationseditnnnntangential velocities at altitudeeditnnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
