war games he is now best remembered for his science fiction novels and is often called a father of science fiction along with jules verne and hugo gernsback.nduring his own lifetime however he was

specialised training was in biology and his thinking on ethical matters took place in a specifically and fundamentally darwinian context he was also from an early date an outspoken socialist often but not always as at the beginning of the first world war sympathising with pacifist views his later works became increasingly political and didactic and he wrote little science fiction while he sometimes indicated on official documents that his profession was that of journalist novels such as kipps and the history of mr polly which describe lower-middle-class life led to the suggestion that he was a worthy successor to charles dickens but wells described a range of social strata and even attempted in tono-bungay 1909 a diagnosis of english society as a whole a diabetic wells co-founded the charity the diabetic association known today as diabetes uk in 1934.nncontentsnnnlifeeditnearly lifeeditnherbert george wells was born at atlas house 162 high street in bromley kent on 21 september 1866 called bertie in the family he was the fourth and last child of joseph wells a former domestic gardener and at the time a shopkeeper and professional cricketer and his wife sarah neal a former domestic servant an inheritance had allowed the family to acquire a shop in which they sold china and sporting goods although it failed to prosper the stock was old and worn out and the location was poor joseph wells managed to earn a meagre income but little of it came from the shop and he received an unsteady amount of money from playing professional cricket for the kent county team payment for skilled bowlers and batsmen came from voluntary donations afterwards or from small payments from the clubs where matches were played.na defining incident of young wellss life was an accident in 1874 that left him bedridden with a broken leg to pass the time he began to read books from the local library brought to him by his father he soon became devoted to the other worlds and lives to which books gave him access they also stimulated his desire to write later that year he entered thomas morleys commercial academy a private school founded in 1849 following the bankruptcy of morleys earlier school the teaching was erratic the curriculum mostly focused wells later said on producing copperplate handwriting and doing the sort of sums useful to tradesmen wells continued at morleys academy until 1880 in 1877 his father joseph wells suffered a fractured thigh the accident effectively put an end to josephs career as a cricketer and his subsequent earnings as a shopkeeper were not enough to compensate for the loss of the primary source of family income.nn wells spent the winter of 1887/88 convalescing at uppark where his mother sarah was housekeeper.nno longer able to support themselves financially the family instead sought to place their sons as apprentices in various occupations from 1880 to 1883 wells had an unhappy apprenticeship as a draper at the southsea drapery emporium hydes his experiences at hydes where he worked a thirteen-hour day and slept in a dormitory with other apprentices later inspired his novels the wheels of chance the history of mr polly and kipps which portray the life of a drapers apprentice as well as providing a critique of societys distribution of wealth.nwellss parents had a turbulent marriage owing primarily to his mothers being a protestant and his fathers being a freethinker when his mother returned to work as a ladys maid at uppark a country house in sussex one of the conditions of work was that she would not be permitted to have living space for her husband and children thereafter she and joseph lived separate lives though they never divorced and remained faithful to each other as a consequence herberts personal troubles increased as he subsequently failed as a draper and also later as a chemists assistant however uppark had a magnificent library in which he immersed himself reading many classic works including platos republic thomas mores utopia and the works of daniel defoe this would be the beginning of wellss venture into literature.nnteachereditn wells studying in london c 1890nin october 1879 wellss mother arranged through a distant relative arthur williams for him to join the national school at wookey in somerset as a pupilteacher a senior pupil who acted as a teacher of younger children in december that year however williams was dismissed for irregularities in his qualifications and wells was returned to uppark after a short apprenticeship at a chemist in nearby midhurst and an even shorter stay as a boarder at midhurst grammar school he signed his apprenticeship papers at hydes in 1883 wells persuaded his parents to release him from the apprenticeship taking an opportunity offered by midhurst grammar school again to become a pupilteacher his proficiency in latin and science during his earlier short stay had been remembered.nthe years he spent in southsea had been the most miserable of his life to that point but his good fortune at securing a position at midhurst grammar school meant that wells could continue his self-education in earnest the following year wells won a scholarship to the normal school of science later the royal college of science in south kensington now part of imperial college london in london studying biology under thomas henry huxley as an alumnus he later helped to set up the royal college of science association of which he became the first president in 1909 wells studied in his new school until 1887 with a weekly allowance of 21 shillings a guinea thanks to his scholarship this ought to have been a comfortable sum of money at the time many working class families had round about a pound a week as their entire household income yet in his experiment in autobiography wells speaks of constantly being hungry and indeed photographs of him at the time show a youth who is very thin and malnourished.nn h g wells in 1907 at the door of his house at sandgatenhe soon entered the debating society of the school these years mark the beginning of his interest in a possible reformation of society at first approaching the subject through platos republic he soon turned to contemporary ideas of socialism as expressed by the recently formed fabian society and free lectures delivered at kelmscott house the home of william morris he was also among the founders of the science school journal a school magazine that allowed him to express his views on literature and society as well as trying his hand at fiction a precursor to his novel the time machine was published in the journal under the title the chronic argonauts the school year 188687 was the last year of his studies.nduring 1888 wells stayed in stoke-on-trent living in basford the unique environment of the potteries was certainly an inspiration he wrote in a letter to a friend from the area that the district made an immense impression on me the inspiration for some of his descriptions in the war of the worlds is thought to have come from his short time spent here seeing the iron foundry furnaces burn over the city shooting huge red light into the skies his stay in the potteries also resulted in the macabre short story the cone 1895 contemporaneous with his famous the time machine set in the north of the city.nafter teaching for some time he was briefly on the staff of holt academy in wales wells found it necessary to supplement his knowledge relating to educational principles and methodology and entered the college of preceptors college of teachers he later received his licentiate and fellowship fcp diplomas from the college it was not until 1890 that wells earned a bachelor of science degree in zoology from the university of london external programme in 188990 he managed to find a post as a teacher at henley house school where he taught a a milne his first published work was a text-book of biology in two volumes 1893.nupon leaving the normal school of science wells was left without a source of income his aunt maryhis fathers sister-in-lawinvited him to stay with her for a while which solved his immediate problem of accommodation during his stay at his aunts residence he grew increasingly interested in her daughter isabel he would later go on to court her to earn money he began writing short humorous articles for journals such as the pall mall gazette later collecting these in volume form as select conversations with an uncle 1895 and certain personal matters 1897 so prolific did wells become at this mode of journalism that many of his early pieces remain unidentified according to david c smith most of wellss occasional pieces have not been collected and many have not even been identified as his wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so as a result many of his early pieces are unknown it is obvious that many early wells items have been lost his success with these shorter pieces encouraged him to write book-length work and he published his first novel the time machine in 1895.nnpersonal lifeeditn 141 maybury rd woking where wells lived from may 1895

wells expressed himself was through his drawings and sketches one common location for these was the endpapers and title pages of his own diaries and they covered a wide variety of topics from political commentary to his feelings toward his literary contemporaries and his current romantic interests during his marriage to amy catherine whom he nicknamed jane he drew a considerable number of pictures many of them being overt comments on their marriage during this period he called these pictures picshuas these picshuas have been the topic of study by wells scholars for many years and in 2006 a book was published on the subject.nnwritereditn statue of a tripod from the war of the worlds in woking england the book is a seminal depiction of a conflict between mankind and an extraterrestrial race.nsome of his early novels called scientific romances invented several themes now classic in science fiction in such works as the time machine the island of doctor moreau the invisible man the war of the worlds when the sleeper wakes and the first men in the moon he also wrote realistic novels that received critical acclaim including kipps and a critique of english culture during the edwardian period tono-bungay wells also wrote dozens of short stories and novellas including the flowering of the strange orchid which helped bring the full impact of darwins revolutionary botanical ideas to a wider public and was followed by many later successes such as the country of the blind 1904.naccording to james gunn one of wellss major contributions to the science fiction genre was his approach which he referred to as his new system of ideas in his opinion the author should always strive to make the story as credible as possible even if both the writer and the reader knew certain elements are impossible allowing the reader to accept the ideas as something that could really happen today referred to as the plausible impossible and suspension of disbelief while neither invisibility nor time travel was new in speculative fiction wells added a sense of realism to the concepts which the readers were not familiar with he conceived the idea of using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time the term time machine coined by wells is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle he explained that while writing the time machine he realized that the more impossible the story i had to tell the more ordinary must be the setting and the circumstances in which i now set the time traveller were all that i could imagine of solid upper-class comforts in wellss law a science fiction story should contain only a single extraordinary assumption being aware the notion of magic as something real had disappeared from society he therefore used scientific ideas and theories as a substitute for magic to justify the impossible wellss best-known statement of the law appears in his introduction to the scientific romances of h g wells 1933,nnas soon as the magic trick has been done the whole business of the fantasy writer is to keep everything else human and real touches of prosaic detail are imperative and a rigorous adherence to the hypothesis any extra fantasy outside the cardinal assumption immediately gives a touch of irresponsible silliness to the invention.ndr griffin the invisible

though tono-bungay is not a science-fiction novel radioactive decay plays a small but consequential role in it radioactive decay plays a much larger role in the world set free 1914 this book contains what is surely his biggest prophetic hit with the first description of a nuclear weapon scientists of the day were well aware that the natural decay of radium releases energy at a slow rate over thousands of years the rate of release is too slow to have practical utility but the total amount released is huge wellss novel revolves around an unspecified invention that accelerates the process of radioactive decay producing bombs that explode with no more than the force of ordinary high explosivesbut which continue to explode for days on end nothing could have been more obvious to the people of the earlier twentieth century he wrote than the rapidity with which war was becoming impossible but they did not see it until the atomic bombs burst in their fumbling hands in 1932 the physicist and conceiver of nuclear chain reaction le szilrd read the world set free the same year sir james chadwick discovered the neutron a book which he said made a great impression on him.nn the h g wells crater located on the far side of the moon was named after the author of the first men in the moon 1901 in 1970.nwells also wrote non-fiction his first non-fiction bestseller was anticipations of the reaction of mechanical and scientific progress upon human life and thought 1901 when originally serialised in a magazine it was subtitled an experiment in prophecy and is considered his most explicitly futuristic work it offered the immediate political message of the privileged sections of society continuing to bar capable men from other classes from advancement until war would force a need to employ those most able rather than the traditional upper classes as leaders anticipating what the world would be like in the year 2000 the book is interesting both for its hits trains and cars

popular amongst the general population and made wells a rich man many other authors followed with outlines of their own in other subjects he reprised his outline in 1922 with a much shorter popular work a short history of the world a history book praised by albert einstein and two long efforts the science of life 1930 and the work wealth and happiness of mankind 1931 the outlines became sufficiently common for james thurber to parody the trend in his humorous essay an outline of scientists"indeed wellss outline of history remains in print with a new 2005 edition while a short history

modern utopia 1905 which shows a worldwide utopia with no imports but meteorites and no exports at all two travellers from our world fall into its alternate history the others usually begin with the world rushing to catastrophe until people realise a better way of living whether by mysterious gases from a comet causing people to behave rationally and abandoning a european war in the days of the comet 1906 or a world council of scientists taking over as in the shape of things to come 1933 which he later adapted for the 1936 alexander korda film things to come this depicted all too accurately the impending world war with cities being destroyed by aerial bombs he also portrayed the rise of fascist dictators in the autocracy of mr parham 1930 and the holy terror 1939 men like gods 1923 is also a utopian novel wells in this period was regarded as an enormously influential figure the critic malcolm cowley stated by the time he was forty his influence was wider than any other living english writer".nwells contemplates the ideas of nature and nurture and questions humanity in books such as the island of doctor moreau not all his scientific romances ended in a utopia and wells also wrote a dystopian novel when the sleeper wakes 1899 rewritten as the sleeper awakes 1910 which pictures a future society where the classes have become more and more separated leading to a revolt of the masses against the rulers the island of doctor moreau is even darker the narrator having been trapped on an island of animals vivisected unsuccessfully into human beings eventually returns to england like gulliver on his return from the houyhnhnms he finds himself unable to shake off the perceptions of his fellow humans as barely civilised beasts slowly reverting to their animal natures.nwells also wrote the preface for the first edition of w n p barbellions diaries the journal of a disappointed man published in 1919 since barbellion was the real authors pen name many

from her unpublished manuscript the web of the worlds romance which had spent nearly nine months in the hands of wellss canadian publisher macmillan canada however it was sworn on oath at the trial that the manuscript remained in toronto in the safekeeping of macmillan and that wells did not even know it existed let alone had seen it the court found no proof of copying and decided the similarities were due to the fact that the books had similar nature and both writers had access to the same sources in 2000 a b mckillop a professor of history at carleton university produced a book on the case the spinster the prophet florence deeks h g wells and the mystery of the purloined past according to mckillop the lawsuit was unsuccessful due to the prejudice against a woman suing a well-known and famous male author and he paints a detailed story based on the circumstantial evidence of the case in 2004 denis n magnusson professor emeritus of the faculty of law queens university ontario published an article on deeks v wells this re-examines the case in relation to mckillops book while having some sympathy for deeks he argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented and though she may have met with sexism from her lawyers she received a fair trial adding that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today i.e 2004.nin 1933 wells predicted in the shape of things to come that the world war he feared would begin in january 1940 a prediction which ultimately came true four months early in september 1939 with

visit he saw his old friend maxim gorky and with gorkys help met vladimir lenin in his book russia in the shadows wells portrayed russia as recovering from a total social collapse the completest that has ever happened to any modern social organisation on 23 july 1934 after visiting u.s president franklin d roosevelt wells went to the soviet union and interviewed joseph stalin for three hours for the new statesman magazine which was extremely rare at that time he told stalin how he had seen the happy faces of healthy people in contrast with his previous visit to moscow in 1920 however he also criticised the lawlessness class-based discrimination state violence and absence of free expression stalin enjoyed the conversation and replied accordingly as the chairman of the london-based pen club

two world wars as the age of frustration".nnreligious viewseditnwells wrote in his book god the invisible king 1917 that his idea of god did not draw upon the traditional religions of the world this book sets out as forcibly and exactly as possible the religious belief of the writer which is a profound belief in a personal and intimate god putting the leading idea of this book very roughly these two antagonistic typical conceptions of god may be best contrasted by speaking of one of them as god-as-nature or the creator and of the other as god-as-christ or the redeemer one is the great outward god the other is the inmost god the first idea was perhaps developed most highly and completely in the god of spinoza it is a conception of god tending to pantheism to an idea of a comprehensive god as ruling with justice rather than affection to a conception of aloofness and awestriking worshipfulness the second idea which is opposed to this idea of an absolute god is the god of the human heart the writer would suggest that the great outline of the theological struggles of that phase of civilisation and world unity which produced christianity was a persistent but unsuccessful attempt to get these two different ideas of god into one focus later in the work he aligns himself with a renascent or modern religion neither atheist nor buddhist nor mohammedan nor christian that he has found growing up in himself".nof christianity he said it is not now true for me every believing christian is i am sure my spiritual brother but if systemically i called myself a christian i feel that to most men i should imply too much and so tell a lie of other world religions he writes all these religions are true for me as canterbury cathedral is a true thing and as a swiss chalet is a true thing there they are and they have served a purpose they have worked only they are not true for me to live in them they do not work for me in the fate of homo sapiens 1939 wells criticised almost all world religions and philosophies stating there is no creed no way of living left in the world at all that really meets the needs of the time when we come to look at them coolly and dispassionately all the main religions patriotic moral and customary systems in which human beings are sheltering today appear to be in a state of jostling and mutually destructive movement like the houses and palaces and other buildings of some vast sprawling city overtaken by a landslide.nnliterary influenceeditn h g wells as depicted in gernsbacks science wonder stories in 1929nthe science fiction historian john
