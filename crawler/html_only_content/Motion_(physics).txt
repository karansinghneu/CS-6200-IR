in position of an object over time motion is mathematically described in terms of displacement distance velocity acceleration time and speed motion of a body is observed by attaching a frame of reference to an observer and measuring the change in position of the body relative to that frame.nif the position of a body is not changing with respect to a given frame of reference reference point the body is said to be at rest motionless immobile stationary or to have constant time-invariant position an objects motion cannot change unless it is acted upon by a force as described momentum is a quantity which is used for measuring the motion of an object an objects momentum is directly related to the objects mass and velocity and the total momentum of all objects in an isolated system one not affected by external forces does not change with time as described by the law of conservation of momentum.nas there is no absolute frame of reference absolute motion cannot be determined thus everything in the universe can be considered to be moving.nmotion applies to objects bodies and matter particles to radiation radiation fields and radiation particles and to space its curvature and space-time one can also speak of motion of shapes and boundaries so the term motion in general signifies a continuous change in the configuration of a physical system for example one can talk about motion of a wave or about motion of a quantum particle where the configuration consists of probabilities of occupying specific positions.nn motion involves a change in position such as in this perspective of rapidly leaving yongsan station.n principle of motion and principle of rest are among the six eternal substances in the jain cosmologyncontentsnnnlaws of motioneditnmain article mechanicsnin physics motion is described through two sets of apparently contradictory laws of mechanics motions of all large-scale and familiar objects in the universe such as projectiles planets cells and humans are described by classical mechanics whereas the motion of very small atomic and sub-atomic objects is described by quantum mechanics.nnnclassical mechanicseditnnclassical mechanics is used for describing the motion of macroscopic objects from projectiles to parts of machinery as well as astronomical objects such as spacecraft planets stars and galaxies it produces very accurate results within these domains and is one of the oldest and largest in science engineering and technology.nclassical mechanics is fundamentally based on newtons laws of motion these laws describe the relationship between the forces acting on a body and the motion of that body they were first compiled by sir isaac newton in his work philosophi naturalis principia mathematica first published on july 5 1687 newtons three laws are:nnnnewtons three laws of motion were the first to accurately provide a mathematical model for understanding orbiting bodies in outer space this explanation unified the motion of celestial bodies and motion of objects on earth.nclassical mechanics was further enhanced by albert einsteins special relativity and general relativity special relativity is concerned with the motion of objects with a high velocity approaching the speed of light general relativity is employed to handle gravitational motion at a deeper level.nuniform motion:nnnwhen an object moves with a constant speed at a particular direction at regular intervals of time its known as the uniform motion for example a bike moving in a straight line with a constant speed.nequations of uniform motion:nif v final velocity u initial velocity a acceleration t time s displacement then nnnnnquantum mechanicseditnmain article quantum mechanicsnquantum mechanics is a set of principles describing physical reality at the atomic level of matter molecules and atoms and the subatomic particles electrons protons neutrons and even smaller elementary particles such as quarks these descriptions include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both matter and radiation energy as described in the waveparticle duality.nin classical mechanics accurate measurements and predictions of the state of objects can be calculated such as location and velocity in the quantum mechanics due to the heisenberg uncertainty principle the complete state of a subatomic particle such as its location and velocity cannot be simultaneously determined.nin addition to describing the motion of atomic level phenomena quantum mechanics is useful in understanding some large-scale phenomenon such as superfluidity superconductivity and biological systems including the function of smell receptors and the structures of proteins.nnlist of imperceptible human motionseditnhumans like all known things in the universe are in constant motion however aside from obvious movements of the various external body parts and locomotion humans are in motion in a variety of ways which are more difficult to perceive many of these imperceptible motions are only perceivable with the help of special tools and careful observation the larger scales of imperceptible motions are difficult for humans to perceive for two reasons newtons laws of motion particularly the third which prevents the feeling of motion on a mass to which the observer is connected and the lack of an obvious frame of reference which would allow individuals to easily see that they are moving the smaller scales of these motions are too small to be detected conventionally with human senses.nnuniverseeditnspacetime the fabric of the universe is expanding meaning everything in the universe is stretching like a rubber band this motion is the most obscure as it is not physical motion as such but rather a change in the very nature of the universe the primary source of verification of this expansion was provided by edwin hubble who demonstrated that all galaxies and distant astronomical objects were moving away from earth known as hubbles law predicted by a universal expansion.nngalaxyeditnthe milky way galaxy is moving through space and many astronomers believe the velocity of this motion to be approximately 600 kilometres per second 1,340,000 mph relative to the observed locations of other nearby galaxies another reference frame is provided by the cosmic microwave background this frame of reference indicates that the milky way is moving at around 582 kilometres per second 1,300,000 mph.nnsun and solar systemeditnthe milky way is rotating around its dense galactic center thus the sun is moving in a circle within the galaxys gravity away from the central bulge or outer rim the typical stellar velocity is between 210 and 240 kilometres per second 470,000 and 540,000 mph all planets and their moons move with the sun thus the solar system is moving.nneartheditnthe earth is rotating or spinning around its axis this is evidenced by day and night at the equator the earth has an eastward velocity of 0.4651 kilometres per second 1,040 mph the earth is also orbiting around the sun in an orbital revolution a complete orbit around the sun takes one year or about 365 days it averages a speed of about 30 kilometres per second 67,000 mph.nncontinentseditnthe theory of plate tectonics tells us that the continents are drifting on convection currents within the mantle causing them to move across the surface of the planet at the slow speed of approximately 2.54 centimetres 1 in per year however the velocities of plates range widely the fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates with the cocos plate advancing at a rate of 75 millimetres 3.0 in per year and the pacific plate moving 5269 millimetres 2.02.7 in per year at the other extreme the slowest-moving plate is the eurasian plate progressing at a typical rate of about 21 millimetres 0.83 in per year.nninternal bodyeditnthe human heart is constantly contracting to move blood throughout the body through larger veins and arteries in the body blood has been found to travel at approximately 0.33 m/s though considerable variation exists and peak flows in the venae cavae have been found between 0.1 and 0.45 metres per second 0.33 and 1.48 ft/s additionally the smooth muscles of hollow internal organs are moving the most familiar would be the occurrence of peristalsis which is where digested food is forced throughout the digestive tract though different foods travel through the body at different rates an average speed through the human small intestine is 3.48 kilometres per hour 2.16 mph the human lymphatic system is also constantly causing movements of excess fluids lipids and immune system related products around the body the lymph fluid has been found to move through a lymph capillary of the skin at approximately 0.0000097 m/s.nncellseditnthe cells of the human body have many structures which move throughout them cytoplasmic streaming is a way which cells move molecular substances throughout the cytoplasm various motor proteins work as molecular motors within a cell and move along the surface of various cellular substrates such as microtubules and motor proteins are typically powered by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate atp and convert chemical energy into mechanical work vesicles propelled by motor proteins have been found to have a velocity of approximately 0.00000152 m/s.nnparticleseditnaccording to the laws of thermodynamics all particles of matter are in constant random motion as long as the temperature is above absolute zero thus the molecules and atoms which make up the human body are vibrating colliding and moving this motion can be detected as temperature higher temperatures which represent greater kinetic energy in the particles feel warm to humans who sense the thermal energy transferring from the object being touched to their nerves similarly when lower temperature objects are touched the senses perceive the transfer of heat away from the body as feeling cold.nnsubatomic particleseditnwithin each atom electrons exist in an area around the nucleus this area is called the electron cloud according to bohrs model of the atom electrons have a high velocity and the larger the nucleus they are orbiting the faster they would need to move if electrons move about the electron cloud in strict paths the same way planets orbit the sun then electrons would be required to do so at speeds which far exceed the speed of light however there is no reason that one must confine ones self to this strict conceptualization that electrons move in paths the same way macroscopic objects do rather one can conceptualize electrons to be particles that capriciously exist within the bounds of the electron cloud inside the atomic nucleus the protons and neutrons are also probably moving around due to the electrical repulsion of the protons and the presence of angular momentum of both particles.nnlighteditnmain article speed of lightnlight propagates at 299,792,458 m/s often approximated as 299,792 kilometres per second 186,282 mi/s in a vacuum the speed of light or c is also the speed of all massless particles and associated fields in a vacuum and it is the upper limit on the speed at which energy matter information or causation can travel the speed of light is the limit of speed for all physical systems.nin addition the speed of light is an invariant quantity it has the same value irrespective of the position or speed of the observer this property makes the speed of light c a natural measurement unit for speed.nntypes of
