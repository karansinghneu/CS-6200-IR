absorption electromagnetic radiation wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnn an overview of electromagnetic radiation absorption this example discusses the general principle using visible light as specific example a white light source emitting light of multiple wavelengths is focused on a sample the pairs of complementary colors are indicated by the yellow dotted lines upon striking the sample photons that match the energy gap of the molecules present green light in this example are absorbed exciting the molecules other photons are transmitted unaffected and if the radiation is in the visible region 400700 nm the transmitted light appears as the complementary color here red by recording the attenuation of light for various wavelengths an absorption spectrum can be obtained.nin physics absorption of electromagnetic radiation is the way in which the energy of a photon is taken up by matter typically the electrons of an atom thus the electromagnetic energy is transformed into internal energy of the absorber for example thermal energy the reduction in intensity of a light wave propagating through a medium by absorption of a part of its photons is often called attenuation usually the absorption of waves does not depend on their intensity linear absorption although in certain conditions usually in optics the medium changes its transparency dependently on the intensity of waves going through and saturable absorption or nonlinear absorption occurs.nncontentsnnnquantifying absorptioneditnmain article mathematical descriptions of opacitynthere are a number of ways to quantify how quickly and effectively radiation is absorbed in a certain medium for example the absorption coefficient and some closely related derived quantities.nthe attenuation coefficient which is sometimes but not always synonymous with the absorption coefficient.nmolar absorptivity is called molar extinction coefficient which is the absorption coefficient divided by molarity see also beerlambert law.nthe mass attenuation coefficient is also called mass extinction coefficient which is the absorption coefficient divided by density.nthe absorption cross section and scattering cross-section are closely related to the absorption and attenuation coefficients respectively.n"extinction in astronomy is equivalent to the attenuation coefficient.nother measures of radiation absorption are penetration depth and skin effect propagation constant attenuation constant phase constant and complex wavenumber,ncomplex refractive index and extinction coefficient complex dielectric constant electrical resistivity and conductivity.nabsorbance also called optical density and optical depth also called optical thickness are two related measures.nall these quantities measure at least to some extent how well a medium absorbs radiation however practitioners of different fields and techniques tend to conventionally use different quantities drawn from the list above.nnmeasuring absorptioneditnthe absorbance of an object quantifies how much of the incident light is absorbed by it instead of being reflected or refracted this may be related to other properties of the object through the beerlambert law.nprecise measurements of the absorbance at many wavelengths allow the identification of a substance via absorption spectroscopy where a sample is illuminated from one side and the intensity of the light that exits from the sample in every direction is measured a few examples of absorption are ultravioletvisible spectroscopy infrared spectroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy.nnapplicationseditn rough plot of earths atmospheric transmittance or opacity to various wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation including visible lightnunderstanding and measuring the absorption of electromagnetic radiation has a variety of applications.nin radio propagation it is represented in non-line-of-sight propagation.nin meteorology and climatology global and local temperatures depend in part on the absorption of radiation by atmospheric gases such as in the greenhouse effect and land and ocean surfaces see albedo.nin medicine x-rays are absorbed to different extents by different tissues bone in particular which is the basis for x-ray imaging for example see computation of radiowave attenuation in the atmosphere used in satellite link design.nin chemistry and materials science because different materials and molecules will absorb radiation to different extents at different frequencies which allows for material identification.nin optics sunglasses colored filters dyes and other such materials are designed specifically with respect to which visible wavelengths they absorb and in what proportions.nin biology photosynthetic organisms require that light of the appropriate wavelengths be absorbed within the active area of chloroplasts so that the light energy can be converted into chemical energy within sugars and other molecules.nin physics the d-region of earths ionosphere is known to significantly absorb radio signals that fall within the high-frequency electromagnetic spectrum.nin nuclear physics absorption of nuclear radiations can be used for measuring the fluid levels densitometry or thickness measurements.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
