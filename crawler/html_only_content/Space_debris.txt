be seen from high earth orbit the two main debris fields are the ring of objects in geosynchronous earth orbit geo and the cloud of objects in low earth orbit leo.ninitially the term space debris referred to the natural debris found in the solar system asteroids comets and meteoroids however with the 1979 beginning of the nasa orbital debris program the term also refers to the debris alt space waste or space garbage from the mass of defunct artificially created objects in space especially earth orbit these include old satellites and spent rocket stages as well as the fragments from their disintegration and collisions.nas of december 2016 five satellite collisions have generated space debris space debris is also known as orbital debris space junk space waste space trash space litter or space garbage.nas of 5 july 2016 the united states strategic command tracked a total of 17,852 artificial objects in orbit above the earth including 1,419 operational satellites however these are just objects large enough to be tracked as of july 2013 more than 170 million bits of debris smaller than 1 cm 0.4 in about 670,000 pieces of debris 110 cm and around 29,000 larger pieces were estimated to be in orbit around the earth collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft they cause damage akin to sandblasting especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or star trackers that cannot be covered with a ballistic whipple shield unless it is transparent.nbelow 2,000 km 1,200 mi earth-altitude pieces of debris are denser than meteoroids most are dust from solid rocket motors surface erosion debris like paint flakes and frozen coolant from rorsat nuclear-powered satellites nfor comparison the international space station orbits in the 300400 kilometres 190250 mi range and the 2009 satellite collision and 2007 antisat test occurred at 800 to 900 kilometres 500 to 560 mi altitude the iss has whipple shielding however known debris with a collision chance over 1/10,000 are avoided by maneuvering the station.nthe kessler syndrome a runaway chain reaction of collisions exponentially increasing the amount of debris has been hypothesized to ensue beyond a critical density this could affect useful polar-orbiting bands increases the cost of protection for spacecraft missions and could destroy live satellites whether kessler syndrome is already underway has been debated the measurement mitigation and potential removal of debris are conducted by some participants in the space industry.nncontentsnnncharacterizationeditnsizeeditnthere are estimated to be over 170 million pieces of debris smaller than 1 cm 0.39 in as of july 2013 there are approximately 670,000 pieces from one to ten cm the current count of large debris defined as 10 cm across or larger is 29,000 the technical measurement cutoff is c 3 mm 0.12 in over 98 percent of the 1,900 tons of debris in low earth orbit as of 2002 was accounted for by about 1,500 objects each over 100 kg 220 lb total mass is mostly constant despite addition of many smaller objects since they reenter the atmosphere sooner using a 2008 figure of 8,500 known items it is estimated at 5,500 t 12,100,000 lb.nnlow earth orbit leoeditn space debris in leo with sizes exaggeratednin leo there are few universal orbits which keep spacecraft in particular rings in contrast to geo a single widely used orbit the closest are sun-synchronous orbits that keep a constant angle between the sun and the orbital plane they are polar meaning they cross over the polar regions leo satellites orbit in many planes up to 15 times a day causing frequent approaches between objects the density of objects is much higher in leo.norbits are further changed by perturbations which in leo include unevenness of the earths gravitational field and collisions can occur from any direction for these reasons the kessler syndrome applies mostly to the leo region impacts occur at up to 16 km/s twice the orbital speed if head-on the 2009 satellite collision occurred at 11.7 km/s creating much spall in the critical size range these can cross other orbits and lead to a cascade effect a large-enough collision e.g between a space station and a defunct satellite could make low earth orbit impassable.nmanned missions are mostly at 400 km 250 mi and below where air drag helps clear zones of fragments atmospheric expansion as a result of space weather raises the critical altitude by increasing drag in the 90s it was a factor in reduced debris density another was fewer launches by russia the ussr made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.nnhigher altitudeseditnat higher altitudes where air drag is less significant orbital decay takes longer slight atmospheric drag lunar perturbations earths gravity perturbations solar wind and solar radiation pressure can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes where it decays but at very high altitudes this may take millennia although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than leo and the onset of the problem is slower the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.nmany communications satellites are in geostationary orbits geo clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path although velocities are low between geo objects when a satellite becomes derelict such as telstar 401 it assumes a geosynchronous orbit its orbital inclination increases about 8 and its speed increases about 100 miles per hour 160 km/h per year impact velocity peaks at about 1.5 km/s 0.93 mi/s orbital perturbations cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and precession of the orbital plane close approaches within 50 meters are estimated at one per year the collision debris pose less short-term risk than from an leo collision but the satellite would likely become inoperable large objects such as solar-power satellites are especially vulnerable to collisions.nalthough the itu now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan studies suggest this is insufficient since geo orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under 1 m 3 ft 3 in the nature of the problem is not well known satellites could be moved to empty spots in geo requiring less maneuvring and making it easier to predict future motion satellites or boosters in other orbits especially stranded in geostationary transfer orbit are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.ndespite efforts to reduce risk spacecraft collisions have occurred the european space agency telecom satellite olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 august 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit on 29 march 2006 the russian express-am11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.nnsourceseditndead

union of concerned scientists listed 902 operational satellites from a known population of 19,000 large objects and about 30,000 objects launched.nan example of additional dead satellite debris are the remains of the 1970s/80s soviet rorsat naval surveillance satellite program the satellites bes-5 nuclear reactor were cooled with a coolant loop of sodium-potassium alloy creating a potential problem when the satellite reached end of life while many satellites were nominally boosted into medium-altitude graveyard orbits not all were even satellites which had been properly moved to a higher orbit had an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period the coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy forming additional debris.nthese events continue to occur for example in february 2015 the usaf defense meteorological satellite program flight 13 dmsp-f13 exploded on orbit creating at least 149 debris objects which were expected to remain in orbit for decades.nnlost equipmenteditn a drifting thermal blanket photographed in 1998 during sts-88.naccording to edward tuftes book envisioning information space debris includes a glove lost by

launch kosmos contained no volatile propellant therefore there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place however the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded tracking showed it broke up into 300 new objects.nmany impacts have been confirmed since olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 august 1993 and left adrift on 24 july 1996 the french microsatellite cerise was hit by fragments of an ariane-1 h-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in november 1986 on 29 march

launch-license policy for earth orbits launchers would rendezvous with capture and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane another possibility is the robotic refueling of satellites experiments have been flown by nasa and spacex is developing large-scale on-orbit propellant transfer technology and tanker spacecraft.nanother approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to always leave the rocket second-stage in an elliptical geocentric orbit with a low-perigee thus ensuring rapid orbital decay and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies such missions require the use of a small kick stage to circularize the orbit but the kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.nnself-removaleditnalthough the itu requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect geo lanes from debris rocket stages or satellites with enough propellant may make a direct controlled de-orbit or if this would require too much propellant a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit this was done with the french spot-1 satellite reducing its atmospheric re-entry time from a projected 200 years to about 15 by lowering its altitude from 830 km 516 mi to about 550 km 342 mi.npassive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed instead of rockets an electrodynamic tether could be attached to a spacecraft at launch at the end of its lifetime the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft other proposals include a booster stage with a sail-like attachment and a large thin inflatable balloon envelope.nnexternal removaleditna consensus of speakers at a meeting in brussels on 30 october 2012 organized by the secure world foundation a u.s think tank and the french international relations institute reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in leo removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.nas of 2006 the cost of any of these solutions is about the same as launching a spacecraft and according to nasas nicholas johnson not cost-effective since then space sweeper with sling-sat 4s a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris has been

infrastructure servicing a commercially developed refueling depot and service spacecraft for communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit originally scheduled for a 2015 launch the sis would be able to push dead satellites into graveyard orbits the advanced common evolved stage family of upper stages is being designed with a high leftover-propellant margin for derelict capture and de-orbit and in-space refueling capability for the high delta-v required to de-orbit heavy objects from geosynchronous orbit a tug-like satellite to drag debris to a safe altitude for it to burn up in the atmosphere has been researched when debris is identified the satellite creates a difference in potential between the debris and itself then using its thrusters to move itself and the debris to a safer orbit.na variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris capture it temporarily to attach a smaller de-orbit satellite and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location the mothership would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for atmospheric entry or move it to a graveyard orbit one such system is the proposed busek orbital debris remover order which would carry over 40 sul satellite on umbilical line de-orbit satellites and propellant sufficient for their removal.nn cleanspace onenon 7 january 2010 star inc reported that it received a

debris producing a rocket-like thrust which slows the object with continued application the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag during the late 1990s the u.s air forces project orion was a laser-broom design although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a space shuttle in 2003 international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements the space shuttle columbia disaster postponed the project and according to nicholas johnson chief scientist and program manager for nasas orbital debris program office there are lots of little gotchas in the orion final report theres a reason why its been sitting on the shelf for more than a decade."nthe momentum of the laser-beam photons could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites nasa research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of 1 mm 0.039 in per second and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by 200 m 660 ft per day one drawback is the potential for material degradation the energy may break up the debris adding to the problem a similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in sun-synchronous orbit using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry a proposal to replace the laser with an ion beam shepherd has been made and other proposals use a foamy ball of aerogel or a spray of water,ninflatable balloons,nelectrodynamic tethers,nboom

mechanism.nninternational regulationeditnholger krag of the european space agency states that as of 2017 there is no binding international regulatory framework with no progress occurring at the respective un body in vienna.nnhistory and shielding technologieseditnmicrometeoroidseditnnmain article micrometeoroidnin 1946 during the giacobinid meteor shower helmut landsberg collected several small magnetic particles that were apparently associated with the shower fred whipple was intrigued by this and wrote a paper that demonstrated that particles of this size were too small to maintain their velocity when they encountered the upper atmosphere instead they quickly decelerated and then fell to earth unmelted in order to classify these sorts of objects he coined the term micro-meteorite".nwhipple in collaboration with fletcher watson of the harvard observatory led an effort to build an observatory to directly measure the velocity of the meteors that could be seen at the time the source of the micro-meteorites was not known direct measurements at the new observatory were used to locate the source of the meteors demonstrating that the bulk of material was left over from comet tails and that none of it could be shown to have an extra-solar origin today it is understood that meteoroids of all sorts are leftover material from the formation of the solar system consisting of particles from the interplanetary dust cloud or other objects made up from this material like comets.nthe early studies were based on optical measurements only in 1957 hans pettersson conducted one of the first direct measurements of the fall of space dust on the earth estimating it to be 14,300,000 tons per year this suggested that the meteoroid flux in space was much higher than the number based on telescope observations such a high flux presented a very serious risk to missions deeper in space specifically the high-orbiting apollo capsules to determine whether the direct measurement was accurate a number of additional studies followed including the pegasus satellite program these showed that the rate of meteors passing into the atmosphere or flux was in line with the optical measurements at around 10,000 to 20,000 tons per year.nnmicrometeoroid shieldingeditnn the energy flash of a hypervelocity impact during a simulation of what happens when a piece of orbital debris hits a spacecraft in orbit.nwhipples work pre-dated the space race and it proved useful when space exploration started only a few years later his studies had demonstrated that the chance of being hit by a meteoroid large enough to destroy a spacecraft was extremely remote however a spacecraft would be almost constantly struck by micrometeorites about the size of dust grains.nwhipple had already developed a solution to this problem in 1946 originally known as a meteor bumper and now termed the whipple shield this consists of a thin foil film held a short distance away from the spacecrafts body when a micrometeoroid strikes the foil it vaporizes into a plasma that quickly spreads by the time this plasma crosses the gap between the shield and the spacecraft it is so diffused that it is unable to penetrate the structural material below the shield allows a spacecraft body to be built to just the thickness needed for structural integrity while the foil adds little additional weight such a spacecraft is lighter than one with panels designed to stop the meteoroids directly.nfor spacecraft that spend the majority of their time in orbit some variety of the whipple shield has been almost universal for decades later research showed that ceramic fibre woven shields offer better protection to hypervelocity 7 km/s particles than aluminium shields of equal weight another modern design uses multi-layer flexible fabric as in nasas design for its never-flown transhab expandable space habitation module,nand the bigelow expandable activity module which was launched in april 2016 and attached to the iss for two years of orbital testing.nnnorad gabbard and kesslereditnto avoid artificial space debris manybut not allresearch satellites are launched on elliptical orbits with perigees inside earths atmosphere so they will destroy themselves willy ley predicted in 1960 that in time a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives after the launch of sputnik 1 in 1957 the north american aerospace defense command norad began compiling a database the space object catalog of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit satellites protective shields and upper and lower-stage booster rockets nasa published modified versions of the database in two-line element set and during the early 1980s the celestrak bulletin board system re-published them.nn gabbard diagram of almost 300 pieces of debris from the disintegration of the five-month-old third stage of the chinese long march 4 booster on 11 march 2000nthe trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions some were deliberately caused during 1960s anti-satellite weapon asat testing and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks to improve tracking norad employee john gabbard kept a separate database studying the explosions gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products and gabbard diagrams or plots are now widely used these studies were used to improve the modelling of orbital evolution and decay.nwhen the norad database became publicly available during the 1970s nasa scientist donald j kessler applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects in 1978 kessler and burton cour-palais co-authored collision frequency of artificial satellites the creation of a debris belt demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in leo in decades rather than billions of years they concluded that by about 2000 space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.nat the time it was widely thought that drag from the upper atmosphere would de-orbit debris faster than it was created however gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the norad data and was familiar with its behaviour in an interview shortly after the publication of kesslers paper gabbard coined the term kessler syndrome to refer to the accumulation of debris it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 popular science article which won the aviation-space writers association 1982 national journalism award.nnfollow-up studieseditn baker-nunn cameras were widely used to study space debris.nthe lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the leo environment in october 1979 nasa provided kessler with funding for further studies several approaches were used by these studies.noptical telescopes or short-wavelength radar was used to measure the number and size of space objects and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50 too low before this it was believed that the norad database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit some objects typically u.s military spacecraft were found to be omitted from the norad list and others were not included because they were considered unimportant the list could not easily account for objects under 20 cm 7.9 in in sizein particular debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.nreturned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts and sections of skylab and the apollo command/service module which were recovered were found to be pitted each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of collisions in space leo already demonstrated the kessler syndrome.nin 1978 kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events primarily explosions of spent rocket stages especially u.s delta rockets he discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described having a large number of objects associated with a payload then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch in 1979 this finding resulted in establishment of the nasa orbital debris program after a briefing to nasa senior management overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old asat tests but from us upper stage rocket explosions and could be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel following the payload injection the upper stage delta rocket beginning in 1986 when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem nasa expanded its program to include international agencies the first being the european space agency a number of other delta components in orbit delta was a workhorse of the u.s space program had not yet exploded.nna new kessler syndromeeditnduring the 1980s the u.s air force conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris the study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.nin 1991 kessler published collisional cascading the limits of population growth in low earth orbit with the best data then available citing the usaf conclusions about creation of debris he wrote that although almost all debris objects such as paint flecks were lightweight most of its mass was in debris about 1 kg 2.2 lb or heavier this mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact creating more debris in the critical-mass area according to the national academy of sciences:nna 1-kg object impacting at 10 km/s for example is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000-kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft in such a breakup numerous fragments larger than 1 kg would be created.nkesslers analysis divided the problem into three parts with a low-enough density the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant beyond that is a critical density where additional debris leads to additional collisions at densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay leading to a cascading chain reaction reducing the orbiting population to small objects several cm in size and increasing the hazard of space activity this chain reaction is known as the kessler syndrome.nin an early 2009 historical overview kessler summed up the situation:nnaggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the strategic defense initiative in the mid-1980s large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in earth orbit and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the ussr the u.s and china over the past 30 years such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.ndebris growtheditnduring the 1980s nasa and other u.s groups attempted to limit the growth of debris one effective solution was implemented by mcdonnell douglas on the delta booster by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks this eliminated the pressure buildup in the tanks which caused them to explode in the past other countries were slower to adopt this measure and due especially to a number of launches by the soviet union the problem grew throughout the decade.na new battery of studies followed as nasa norad and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward although in 1981 when schefters article was published the number of objects was estimated at 5,000 new detectors in the ground-based electro-optical deep space surveillance system found new objects by the late 1990s it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit by 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an asat test and a satellite collision in 2011 nasa said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.nthe growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings according to kesslers 1991 derivation and 2001 updates the leo environment in the 1,000 km 620 mi altitude range should be cascading however only one major incident has occurred the 2009 satellite collision between iridium 33 and cosmos 2251 the lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem according to kessler a cascade would not be obvious until it was well advanced which might take years.na 2006 nasa model suggested that if no new launches took place the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055 when it would increase on its own richard crowther of britains defence evaluation and research agency said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015 the national academy of sciences summarizing the professional view noted widespread agreement that two bands of leo space900 to 1,000 km 620 mi and 1,500 km 930 miwere already past critical density.nin the 2009 european air and space conference university of southampton researcher hugh lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years as of 2009 more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.na 2011 report by the u.s national research council warned nasa that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level according to some computer models the amount of space debris has reached a tipping point with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris raising the risk of spacecraft failures the report called for international regulations limiting debris
