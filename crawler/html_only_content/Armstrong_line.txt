armstrong limit wikipedia n redirected from armstrong linen jump to navigationnjump to searchn if the cockpit lost pressure while the aircraft was above the armstrong limit even a positive pressure oxygen mask could not sustain pilot consciousness.nthe armstrong limit or armstrongs line is a measure of altitude above which atmospheric pressure is sufficiently low that water boils at the normal temperature of the human body humans absolutely cannot survive above this limit in an unpressurized environment above earth this begins at 1819 km 1112 mi 59,00062,000 ft above sea level the term is named after united states air force general harry george armstrong who was the first to recognize this phenomenon.nthe relevant external pressure on the human body is 0.0618 atm 6.3 kpa 47 mmhg or about 1 psi.nncontentsnnneffect on body fluidseditnnat or above the armstrong limit exposed body fluids such as saliva tears urine blood and the liquids wetting the alveoli within the lungsbut not vascular blood blood within the circulatory systemwill boil away without a full-body pressure suit and no amount of breathable oxygen delivered by any means will sustain life for more than a few minutes the nasa technical report rapid explosive decompression emergencies in pressure-suited subjects which discusses the brief accidental exposure of a human to near vacuum notes the likely result of exposure to pressure below that associated with the armstrong limit the subject later reported that his last conscious memory was of the water on his tongue beginning to boil."nat the nominal body temperature of 37 c 98.6 f water has a vapour pressure of 6.3 kilopascals 47 mmhg which is to say at an ambient pressure of 6.3 kilopascals 47 mmhg the boiling point of water is 37 c 98.6 f a pressure of 6.3 kpathe armstrong limitis about 1/16 of the standard sea-level atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kilopascals 760 mmhg modern formulas for calculating the standard pressure at a given altitude varyas do the precise pressures one will actually measure at a given altitude on a given daybut a common formula shows that 6.3 kpa is typically found at an altitude of 19,000 m 62,000 ft.nblood pressure is a gauge pressure which means it is measured relative to ambient pressure to calculate blood pressure it has to be summed to ambient pressure for calculating when blood will boil this is similar to a flat automobile tire even with zero gauge pressure a flat tire at altitude of the armstrong limit would still have an absolute pressure pressure relative to a perfect vacuum of 63 hectopascals 0.91 psi that is it will have the ambient pressure at the altitude where the 6.3 kpa pressure level occurs about 18 km 60,000 ft both inside and out of it if one inflates the tire to non-zero gauge pressure this internal pressure is in addition to those 6.3 kilopascals 0.91 psi of ambient pressure this means that for an individual with a diastolic low blood pressure typically 8.0 kpa 60 mmhg the persons blood pressure would be 14.3 kpa 107 mmhg the sum of the blood pressure and the ambient pressure this pressure is more than twice the ambient pressure at the armstrong limit this extra pressure is more than sufficient to prevent blood from outright boiling at 18 km 60,000 ft while the heart is still beating.nnhypoxia below the armstrong limiteditn mario pezzi a pilot in 1937 wearing a pressure suit to avoid hypoxia.nwell below the armstrong limit humans typically require supplemental oxygen in order to avoid hypoxia for most people this is typically needed at altitudes above 4,500 m 15,000 ft commercial jetliners are required to maintain cabin pressurization at a cabin altitude of not greater than 2,400 m 8,000 ft u.s regulations on general aviation aircraft non-airline non-government flights require that the minimum required flight crew but not the passengers be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends more than half an hour at a cabin altitude above 3,800 m 12,500 ft the minimum required flight crew must be on supplemental oxygen if the plane spends any time above a cabin altitude of 4,300 m 14,000 ft and even the passengers must be provided with supplemental oxygen above a cabin altitude of 4,500 m 15,000 ft skydivers who are at altitude only briefly before jumping do not normally exceed 4,500 m 15,000 ft.nnhistorical significanceeditnthe armstrong limit describes the altitude associated with an objective precisely defined natural phenomenon the vapor pressure of body-temperature water in the late 1940s it represented a new fundamental hard limit to altitude that went beyond the somewhat subjective observations of human physiology and the timedependent effects of hypoxia experienced at lower altitudes pressure suits had long been worn at altitudes well below the armstrong limit to avoid hypoxia in 1936 francis swain of the royal air force reached 15,230 m 49,970 ft flying a bristol type 138 while wearing a pressure suit two years later italian military officer mario pezzi set an altitude record of 17,083 m 56,047 ft wearing a pressure suit in his open-cockpit caproni ca.161 biplane even though he was well below the altitude at which body-temperature water boils.na pressure suit is normally required at around 15,000 m 49,000 ft for a well conditioned and experienced pilot to safely operate an aircraft in unpressurized cabins in an unpressurized cockpit at altitudes greater than 11,900 m 39,000 ft above sea level the physiological reaction even when breathing pure oxygen is hypoxiainadequate oxygen level causing confusion and eventual loss of consciousness air contains 20.95 oxygen at 11,900 m 39,000 ft breathing pure oxygen through an unsealed face mask one is breathing the same partial pressure of oxygen as one would experience with regular air at around 3,600 m 11,800 ft above sea level at higher altitudes oxygen must be delivered through a sealed mask with increased pressure to maintain a physiologically adequate partial pressure of oxygen if the user does not wear a pressure suit or a counter-pressure garment that restricts the movement of their chest the high pressure air can cause damage to the lungs.nfor modern military aircraft such as the united states f22 and f35 both of which have operational altitudes of 18,000 m 59,000 ft or more the pilot wears a counter-pressure garment which is a gsuit with high-altitude capabilities in the event the cockpit loses pressure the oxygen system switches to a positive-pressure mode to deliver above-ambient-pressure oxygen to a specially sealing mask as well as to proportionally inflate the counter-pressure garment the garment counters the outward expansion of the pilots chest to prevent pulmonary barotrauma until the pilot can descend to a safe altitude.nnsee alsoeditn comparison of a graph of international standard atmosphere temperature and pressure with the armstrong limit and
