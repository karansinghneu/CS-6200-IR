and acquired the name dragon storm.nthe dust storms of mars vary in size but can often cover the entire planet they tend to occur when mars comes closest to the sun and have been shown to increase the global temperature.none particularly large martian storm was exhaustively studied up close due to coincidental timing when the first spacecraft to successfully orbit another planet mariner 9 arrived and successfully orbited mars on 14 november 1971 planetary scientists were surprised to find the atmosphere was thick with a planet-wide robe of dust the largest storm ever observed on mars the surface of the planet was totally obscured mariner 9s computer was reprogrammed from earth to delay imaging of the surface for a couple of months until the dust settled however the surface-obscured

buildings bridges and other outside objects turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles in the united states major hurricanes comprise just 21 of all landfalling tropical cyclones but account for 83 of all damage tropical cyclones often knock out power to tens or hundreds of thousands of people preventing vital communication and hampering rescue efforts tropical cyclones often destroy key bridges overpasses and roads complicating efforts to transport food clean water and medicine to the areas that need it furthermore the damage caused by tropical cyclones to buildings and dwellings can result in economic damage to a region and to a diaspora of the population of the region.nthe storm surge or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones historically resulting in 90 of tropical cyclone deaths the relatively quick surge in sea level can move miles/kilometers inland flooding homes and cutting off escape routes the storm surges and winds of hurricanes may be destructive to human-made structures but they also stir up the waters of coastal estuaries which are typically important fish breeding locales.ncloud-to-ground lightning frequently occurs within the phenomena of thunderstorms and have numerous hazards towards landscapes and populations one of the more significant hazards lightning can pose is the wildfires they are capable of igniting under a regime of low precipitation lp thunderstorms where little precipitation is present rainfall cannot prevent fires from starting when vegetation is dry as lightning produces a concentrated amount of extreme heat wildfires can devastate vegetation and the biodiversity of an ecosystem wildfires that occur close to urban environments can inflict damages upon infrastructures buildings crops and provide risks to explosions should the flames be exposed to gas pipes direct damage caused by lightning strikes occurs on occasion in areas with a high frequency for cloud-to-ground lightning like florida lightning causes several fatalities per year most commonly to people working outside.nprecipitation with low potential of hydrogen levels ph otherwise known as acid rain is also a frequent risk produced by lightning distilled water which contains no carbon dioxide has a neutral ph of 7 liquids with a ph less than 7 are acidic and those with a ph greater than 7 are bases clean or unpolluted rain has a slightly acidic ph of about 5.2 because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid a weak acid ph 5.6 in distilled water but unpolluted rain also contains other chemicals nitric oxide present during thunderstorm phenomena caused by the splitting of nitrogen molecules can result in the production of acid rain if nitric oxide forms compounds with the water molecules in precipitation thus creating acid rain acid rain can damage infrastructures containing calcite or other solid chemical compounds containing carbon in ecosystems acid rain can dissolve plant tissues of vegetations and increase acidification process in bodies of water and in soil resulting in deaths of marine and terrestrial organisms.nhail damage to roofs often goes unnoticed until further structural damage is seen such as leaks or cracks it is hardest to recognize hail damage on shingled roofs and flat roofs but all roofs have their own hail damage detection problems metal roofs are fairly resistant to hail damage but may accumulate cosmetic damage in the form of dents and damaged coatings hail is also a common nuisance to drivers of automobiles severely denting the vehicle and cracking or even shattering windshields and windows rarely massive hailstones have been known to cause concussions or fatal head trauma hailstorms have been the cause of costly and deadly events throughout history one of the earliest recorded incidents occurred around the 9th century in roopkund uttarakhand india the largest hailstone in terms of diameter and weight ever recorded in the united states fell on july 23 2010 in vivian south dakota in the united states it measured 8 inches 20 cm in diameter and 18.62 inches 47.3 cm in circumference weighing in at 1.93 pounds 0.88 kg this broke the previous record for diameter set by a hailstone 7 inches diameter and 18.75 inches circumference which fell in aurora nebraska in the united states on june 22 2003 as well as the record for weight set by a hailstone of 1.67 pounds 0.76 kg that fell in coffeyville kansas in 1970.nvarious hazards ranging from hail to lightning can affect outside technology facilities such as antennas satellite dishes and towers as a result companies with outside facilities have begun installing such facilities underground in order to reduce the risk of damage from storms.nsubstantial snowfall can disrupt public infrastructure and services slowing human activity even in regions that are accustomed to such weather air and ground transport may be greatly inhibited or shut down entirely populations living in snow-prone areas have developed various ways to travel across the snow such as skis snowshoes and sleds pulled by horses dogs or other animals and later snowmobiles basic utilities such as electricity telephone lines and gas supply can also fail in addition snow can make roads much harder to travel and vehicles attempting to use them can easily become stuck.nthe combined effects can lead to a snow day on which gatherings such as school work or church are officially canceled in areas that normally have very little or no snow a snow day may occur when there is only light accumulation or even the threat of snowfall since those areas are unprepared to handle any amount of snow in some areas such as some states in the united states schools are given a yearly quota of snow days or calamity days once the quota is exceeded the snow days must be made up in other states all snow days must be made up for example schools may extend the remaining school days later into the afternoon shorten spring break or delay the start of summer vacation.naccumulated snow is removed to make travel easier and safer and to decrease the long-term effect of a heavy snowfall this process utilizes shovels and snowplows and is often assisted by sprinkling salt or other chloride-based chemicals which reduce the melting temperature of snow in some areas with abundant snowfall such as yamagata prefecture japan people harvest snow and store it surrounded by insulation in ice houses this allows the snow to be used through the summer for refrigeration and air conditioning which requires far less electricity than traditional cooling methods.nnagricultureeditnhail can cause serious damage notably to automobiles aircraft skylights glass-roofed structures livestock and most commonly farmers crops wheat corn soybeans and tobacco are the most sensitive crops to hail damage hail is one of canadas most expensive hazards snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator conserving the heat of the earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring providing water for crop growth if it melts into water and refreezes upon sensitive crops such as oranges the resulting ice will protect the fruit from exposure to lower temperatures although tropical cyclones take an enormous toll in lives and personal property they may be important factors in the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions hurricanes in the eastern north pacific often supply moisture to the southwestern united states and parts of mexico japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons hurricane camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path though it also killed 259 people and caused 9.14 billion 2005 usd in damage.nnaviationeditn effect of wind shear on aircraft trajectory merely correcting for the initial gust front can have dire consequences.nhail is one of the most significant thunderstorm hazards to aircraft when hail stones exceed 0.5 inches 13 mm in diameter planes can be seriously damaged within seconds the hailstones accumulating on the ground can also be hazardous to landing aircraft strong wind outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level initially this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear as the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft the localized headwind diminishes reducing the aircrafts airspeed and increasing its sink rate then when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft the headwind becomes a tailwind reducing lift generated by the wings and leaving the aircraft in a low-power low-speed descent this can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact as the result of the accidents in the 1970s and 1980s in 1988 the u.s federal aviation administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993 between 1964 and 1985 wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the u.s that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries since 1995 the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of doppler weather radar units on the ground nexradnnrecreationeditnmany winter sports such as skiing snowboarding snowmobiling and snowshoeing depend upon snow where snow is scarce but the temperature is low enough snow cannons may be used to produce an adequate amount for such sports children and adults can play on a sled or ride in a sleigh although a persons footsteps remain a visible lifeline within a snow-covered landscape snow cover is considered a general danger to hiking since the snow obscures landmarks and makes the landscape itself appear uniform.nnnotable storms in art and cultureeditn the great wave off kanagawa an ukiyo-e print by hokusainin mythology and
