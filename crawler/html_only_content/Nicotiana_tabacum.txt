air ground humidity and the type of land temperatures of 2030 c 6886 f are best for adequate growth an atmospheric humidity of 80 to 85 and soil without a high level of nitrogen are also optimal.nnparasiteseditnthe potato tuber moth phthorimaea operculella is an oligophagous insect that prefers to feed on plants of the family solanaceae such as tobacco plants female p operculella use

stem 13 in the root and 5 in the flowers.nnphytochemicalseditnnatural tobacco polysaccharides including cellulose have been shown to be the primary precursors of acetaldehyde in tobacco smoke the main

the tobacco smoke a light sweet flavour and high in nicotine cigar and burley tobaccos are air cured.nin fire curing smoke from a low-burning fire on the barn floor permeates the leaves this gives the leaves a distinctive smoky aroma and flavor fire curing takes three to ten weeks and produces a tobacco low in sugar and high in nicotine pipe tobacco chewing tobacco and snuff are fire cured.nflue-cured tobacco is kept in an enclosed barn heated by flues pipes of hot air but the tobacco is not directly exposed to smoke this method produces cigarette tobacco that is high in sugar and has medium to high levels of nicotine it is the fastest method of curing requiring about a week virginia tobacco that has been flue cured is also called bright tobacco because flue curing turns its
