chinese space agency since 1993 see china national space administration.nn the change 5-t1 test vehicle service module took this photo of earth and the moon together on november 9 2014nthe space program of the peoples republic of china is directed by the china national space administration cnsa its technological roots can be traced back to the late 1950s when china began a ballistic missile program in response to perceived american and later soviet threats however the first chinese crewed space program only began several decades later when an accelerated program of technological development culminated in yang liweis successful 2003 flight aboard shenzhou 5 this achievement made china the third country to independently send humans into space plans currently include a permanent chinese space station in 2020 and crewed expeditions to the moon.nofficials have articulated long term ambitions to exploit earth-moon space for industrial development.nncontentsnnnhistory and recent developmentseditnnnn dong fang hong i chinese first satellite 1970 space technology exhibition in hohhot inner mongolia chinanafter the united states threatened to use nuclear weapons during the korean war chairman mao zedong decided that only a nuclear deterrent of its own would guarantee the security of the newly founded prc additionally he wanted china to gain status among the worlds powers thatas he feltdid not respect him from this he decided instead to only implement his new plan with the republic of china present-day taiwan as china thus mao announced his decision to develop chinas own strategic weapons including nuclear bombs and associated missiles for the warheads during a communist party of china cpc central committee meeting held on january 15 1955 the chinese nuclear weapons program was designated by the codename of 02".nthe fifth academy of the national defense ministry was founded on october 8 1956 with qian xuesen who had just been deported from the united states after being accused of being a communist during the red scare as director the academy started the development of the first ballistic missile program adopted on march 1 1956 and known as the first twelve-year-plan for chinese aerospace.nafter the launch of mankinds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 by the soviet union on october 4 1957 mao decided during the national congress of the cpc on may 17 1958 to make china an equal with the superpowers we need to develop the artificial satellite too by adopting project 581 with the objective of placing a satellite in orbit by 1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the prcs founding.nthis goal would be achieved in three phases developing sounding rockets first then launching small satellites and in the final phase large satellites.nnnduring the cordial sino-soviet relations of the 1950s the ussr engaged in a cooperative technology transfer program with the prc under which they trained chinese students and provided the fledgling program with a sample r-2 rocket but when soviet premier nikita khrushchev was denounced as revisionist with mao asserting that there had been a counter-revolution in the soviet union and that capitalism had been restored the friendly relationship between the two countries turned to confrontation as a consequence all soviet technological assistance was abruptly withdrawn after the 1960 sino-soviet split.nonly 17 days after the last soviet expert had left china the first soviet built r-2 rocket fueled with chinese-made propellant was launched with success on september 10 1960 due to cold war tension mao decided in december 1963 that china should develop missile defence system capacity during a conference held on february 2 1964 directive 640 640was adopted later known as project 640.nnn the launch of long march 3b rocket in 1997n long march 2d lifting off in 2012n jiuquan satellite launch center one of the first chinese spaceportn chinese eva spacesuit feitian".nas the space race between the two superpowers reached its climax with the conquest of the moon mao and zhou enlai decided on july 14 1967 that the prc should not be left behind and started chinas own crewed space program.nnnnafter mao died on september 9 1976 his rival deng xiaoping denounced during the cultural revolution as reactionary and therefore forced to retire from all his offices slowly re-emerged as chinas new leader in 1978 at first new development was slowed then several key projects deemed unnecessary were simply cancelledthe fanji abm system the xianfeng anti-missile super gun the icbm early warning network 7010 tracking radar and the land-based high-power anti-missile laser program nevertheless some development did proceed.nnnalong dengs policy of capitalist reforms in the chinese economy chinese culture also changed therefore names used in the space program previously all chosen from the revolutionary history of the prc were soon replaced with mystical-religious ones thus new long march carrier rockets were renamed divine arrow spacecraft divine vessel space plane divine dragon land-based high-power laser divine light and supercomputer divine might nnnchina has since turned its focus to extraterrestrial exploration starting with the moon the first chinese lunar exploration program un-crewed lunar orbiter change 1 was successfully launched on october 24 2007 making china the fifth nation to successfully orbit the moon.nnchinese space program and the international communityeditndual-use technologies and outer spaceeditnthe prc is a member of the united nations committee on the peaceful uses of outer space and a signatory to all united nations treaties and conventions on space with the exception of the unpopular 1979 moon treaty the united states government has long been resistant to the use of prc launch services by american industry due to concerns over alleged civilian technology transfer that could have dual-use military applications to countries such as north korea iran or syria and announced an official embargo against the prc in 2000 thus financial retaliatory measures have been taken on many occasions against several chinese space companies.nnchinese exclusion policy of nasaeditnfurther information chinese exclusion policy of nasandue to security concerns all researchers from the u.s national aeronautics and space administration nasa are prohibited from working with chinese citizens affiliated with a chinese state enterprise or entity in april 2011 the 112th united states congress banned nasa from using its funds to host chinese visitors at nasa facilities in march 2013 the u.s congress passed legislation barring chinese nationals from entering nasa facilities without a waiver from nasa.nthe history of the u.s exclusion policy can be traced back in 1998 when a u.s congressional commission led by christopher cox discovered that the technical information that american companies provided china for its commercial satellite ended up improving chinese intercontinental ballistic missile technology this was further aggravated in 2007 when china blew up its space station in the low earth orbit to test a ground-based anti-satellite asat missile the debris created by the explosion contributed to the space junk that litter earths orbit exposing american military space assets at the risk such as accidental collision the united states also fears the chinese application of dual-use space technology for nefarious purposes the u.s imposed an embargo to the u.s china space cooperation throughout the 2000s and by 2011 a clause inserted by then-congressman frank wolf in the 2011 u.s federal budget forbids nasa from hosting or participating in a joint scientific activity with china.nthe chinese response to the exclusion policy involved its own space policy of opening up its space station to the outside world welcoming scientists coming from all countries american scientists have also boycotted nasa conferences due to its rejection of chinese nationals in these events.nnorganizationeditninitially the space program of the prc was organized under the peoples liberation army particularly the second artillery corps in the 1990s however the prc reorganized the space program as part of a general reorganization of the defense industry to make it resemble western defense procurement.nthe china national space administration an agency within the commission of science technology and industry for national defense currently headed by sun laiyan is now responsible for launches the long march rocket is produced by the china academy of launch vehicle technology and satellites are produced by the china aerospace science and technology corporation the latter organizations are state-owned enterprises however it is the intent of the prc government that they should not be actively state managed and that they should behave much as private companies would in the west.nnuniversities and instituteseditnthe space program also has close links with:nnnspace citieseditnnsuborbital launch siteseditnnsatellite launch centerseditnthe prc operates 4 satellite

landing on the moon mao zedong and zhou enlai decided on july 14 1967 that the prc should not be left behind and therefore initiated chinas own crewed space program the top-secret project 714 aimed to put two people into space by 1973 with the shuguang spacecraft nineteen plaaf pilots were selected for this goal on march 1971 the shuguang-1 spacecraft to be launched with the cz-2a rocket was designed to carry a crew of two the program was officially cancelled on may 13 1972 for economic reasons though the internal politics of the cultural revolution likely motivated the closure.nthe short-lived second crewed program was based on the successful implementation of landing technology third in the world after ussr and united states by fsw satellites it was announced a few times in 1978 with the open publishing of some details including photos but then was abruptly canceled in 1980 it has been argued that the second crewed program was created solely for propaganda purposes and was never intended to produce results.nnproject 863editna new crewed space program was proposed by the chinese academy of sciences in march 1986 as astronautics plan 863-2 this consisted of a crewed spacecraft project 863-204 used to ferry astronaut crews to a space station project 863-205 in september of that year astronauts in training were presented by the chinese media the various proposed crewed spacecraft were mostly spaceplanes project 863 ultimately evolved into the 1992 project 921.nnproject 921 shenzhoueditnspacecrafteditnmain article shenzhou programn shenzhou 7 re-entry modulen a model of shenzhou spacecraftnin 1992 authorization and funding was given for the first phase of project 921 which was a plan to launch a crewed spacecraft the shenzhou program had four uncrewed test flights and two crewed missions the first one was shenzhou 1 on november 20 1999 on january 9 2001 shenzhou 2 launched carrying test animals shenzhou 3 and shenzhou 4 were launched in 2002 carrying test dummies following these was the successful shenzhou 5 chinas first crewed mission in space on october 15 2003 which carried yang liwei in orbit for 21 hours and made china the third nation to launch a human into orbit shenzhou 6 followed two years later ending the first phase of the project 921 missions are launched on the long march 2f rocket from the jiuquan satellite launch center the china crewed space engineering office provides engineering and administrative support for the crewed shenzhou missions.nnspace laboratoryeditnmain article project 921-2nthe second phase of the project 921 started with shenzhou 7 chinas first spacewalk mission then two crewed missions were planned to the first chinese space laboratory the prc initially designed the shenzhou spacecraft with docking technologies imported from russia therefore compatible with the international space station iss on september 29 2011 china launched tiangong 1 this target module is intended to be the first step to testing the technology required for a planned space station.non october 31 2011 a long march 2f rocket lifted the shenzhou 8 uncrewed spacecraft which docked twice with the tiangong 1 module the shenzhou 9 craft took off on 16 june 2012 with a crew of 3 it successfully docked with the tiangong-1 laboratory on 18 june 2012 at 06:07 utc marking chinas first manned spacecraft docking another manned mission shenzhou 10 launched on 11 june 2013 the tiangong 1 target module is then expected to be deorbited.na second space lab tiangong 2 launched on 15 september 2016 22:04:09 utc+8 the launch mass was 8,600 kg with a length of 10.4m and a width of 3.35m much like the tiangong 1 shenzhou 11 launched and rendezvoused with tiangong 2 in october 2016 with an unconfirmed further mission shenzhou 12 in the future the tiangong 2 brings with it the polar gamma ray burst detector a space-earth quantum key distribution and laser communications experiment to be used in conjunction with the mozi quantum science satellite a liquid bridge thermocapillary convection experiment and a space material experiment also included is a stereoscopic microwave altimeter a space plant growth experiment and a multi-angle wide-spectral imager and multi-spectral limb imaging spectrometer onboard tg-2 there will also be the worlds first-ever in-space cold atomic fountain clock nnspace stationeditnmain articles chinese space station and tiangong programna larger basic permanent space station would be the third and last phase of project 921 this will be a modular design with an eventual weight of around 60 tons to be completed sometime before 2020 the first section designated tiangong 3 is scheduled for launch after tiangong 2 tiangong 3 will weigh 22 tons and be 18.1 metres long additional modules will be connected over several missions to build the space station.nthis could also be the beginning of chinas crewed international cooperation the existence of which was officially disclosed for the first time after the launch of shenzhou 7.nthe chinese space station is scheduled to be completed in 2020.nnproposed lunar explorationeditnmain article chinese lunar exploration programnin february 2004 the prc formally started the implementation phase of its uncrewed moon exploration project according to sun laiyan administrator of the china national space administration the project will involve three phases orbiting the moon landing and returning samples the first phase planned to spend 1.4 billion renminbi approx us$170 million to orbit a satellite around the moon before 2007 which is ongoing phase two involves sending a lander before 2010 phase three involves collecting lunar soil samples before 2020.non november 27 2005 the deputy commander of the crewed spaceflight program announced that the prc planned to complete a space station and a crewed mission to the moon by 2020 assuming funding was approved by the government.non december 14 2005 it was reported an effort to launch lunar orbiting satellites will be supplanted in 2007 by a program aimed at accomplishing an uncrewed lunar landing a program to return uncrewed space vehicles from the moon will begin in 2012 and last for five years until the crewed program gets underway in 2017 with a crewed moon landing some time after that.nnonetheless the decision to develop a totally new moon rocket in the 1962 soviet ur-700m-class project aelita able to launch a 500-ton payload in lto and a more modest 50 tons lto payload lv has been discussed in a 2006 conference by academician zhang guitian a liquid propellant rocket engine specialist who developed the cz-2 and cz-4a rockets engines.non june 22 2006 long lehao deputy chief architect of the lunar probe project laid out a schedule for chinas lunar exploration he set 2024 as the date of chinas first moonwalk.nin september 2010 it was announced that the country is planning to carry out explorations in deep space by sending a man to the moon by 2025 china also hopes to bring a moon rock sample back to earth in 2017 and subsequently build an observatory on the moons surface ye peijian commander in chief of the change programme and an academic at the chinese academy of sciences added that china has the full capacity to accomplish mars exploration by 2013."non january 3 2019 change 4 the china national space administrations lunar rover successfully landed on the far side of the moon the rover was able to transmit data back to earth despite the lack of radio frequencies on the far side via a dedicated satellite sent earlier to orbit the moon the landing and data transmission is considered a landmark achievement for human space exploration.nnon december 14 2013 chinas change 3 became the first object to soft-land on the moon since luna 24 in 1976.nas indicated by the official chinese lunar exploration program insignia denoted by a calligraphic moon ideogram in the shape of a nascent lunar crescent with two human footsteps at its center the ultimate objective of the program is to establish a permanent human presence on the earths natural satellite.nn annotated image of the approximate landing site of the chinese change-3

symposium of international academy of astronautics iaa in beijing on may 22 2007 that building a lunar base was a crucial step to realize a flight to mars and farther planets.naccording to practice since the whole project is only at a very early preparatory research phase no official crewed moon program has been announced yet by the authorities but its existence is nonetheless revealed by regular intentional leaks in the media a typical example is the lunar roving vehicle that was shown on a chinese tv channel during the 2008 may day celebrations.nnmission to mars and beyondeditnsee also yinghuo-1 and mars global remote sensing orbiter and small rovernsun laiyan administrator of the china national space administration said on july 20 2006 that china would start deep space exploration focusing on mars over the next five years during the eleventh five-year plan 20062010 program period.nthe first uncrewed mars exploration program could take place sometime between now and 2033 followed by a crewed phase in 2040-2060 the mars 500 study of 2011 prepared for this manned mission.nmoreover in order to make crewed flight in deep space toward mars safer a space weather forecast system was to be completed by 2017 with the kuafu mission satellites placed at the lagrangian point l1 however due to withdrawal first by canada and then esa the project was indefinitely postponed.nin 2006 the chief designer of the shenzhou spacecraft stated in an interview that:nnnspace-based solar powereditnaccording to the china academy of space technology cast presentation at the 2015 international space development congress in toronto canada chinese interest in space-based solar power began in the period 19901995 by 2011 there was a proposal for a national program with advocates such as pioneer professor wang xiji stating in an article for the ministry of science and technology that china had built up a solid industrial foundation acquired sufficient technology and had enough money to carry out the most ambitious space project in history once completed the solar station with a capacity of 100mw would span at least one square kilometre dwarfing the international space station and becoming the biggest man-made object in space and warned that if it did not act quickly china would let other countries in particular the us and japan take the lead and occupy strategically important locations in space global security cites a 2011-01 journal of rocket propulsion that articulates the need for 620 launches of their long march-9 cz-9 heavy lift system for the construction of an orbital solar power plant with 10,000 mw capacity massing 50,000 tonnes.nn impression of the chinese space station by an artistnby 2013 there was a national goal that the state has decided that power coming from outside of the earth such as solar power and development of other space energy resources is to be chinas future direction and the following roadmap was identified in 2010 cast will finish the concept design in 2020 we will finish the industrial level testing of in-orbit construction and wireless transmissions in 2025 we will complete the first 100kw sps demonstration at leo and in 2035 the 100mw sps will have electric generating capacity finally in 2050 the first commercial level sps system will be in operation at geo the article went on to state that since sps development will be a huge project it will be considered the equivalent of an apollo program for energy in the last century americas leading position in science and technology worldwide was inextricably linked with technological advances associated with implementation of the apollo program likewise as chinas current achievements in aerospace technology are built upon with its successive generations of satellite projects in space china will use its capabilities in space science to assure sustainable development of energy from space."nin 2015 the cast team won the international sunsat design competition with their video of a multi-rotary joint concept the design was presented in detail in a paper for the online journal of space communication.nin 2016 lt gen zhang yulin deputy chief of the pla armament development department of the central military commission suggested that china would next begin to exploit earth-moon space for industrial development the goal would be the construction of space-based solar power satellites that would beam energy back to earth.nngoalseditnthe china national space administration stated that their long-term goals
