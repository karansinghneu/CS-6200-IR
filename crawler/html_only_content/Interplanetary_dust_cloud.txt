interplanetary dust cloud wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn artist concept of a view from an exoplanet with light from an exoplanetary dust cloudnthe interplanetary dust cloud or zodiacal cloud consists of cosmic dust small particles floating in outer space that pervades the space between planets within planetary systems such as the solar system this system of particles has been studied for many years in order to understand its nature origin and relationship to larger bodies.nin our solar system the interplanetary dust particles have a role in scattering sunlight and in emitting thermal radiation which is the most prominent feature of the night skys radiation with wavelengths ranging 550 m the particle sizes of grains characterizing the infrared emission near earths orbit typically range 10100 m.nthe total mass of the interplanetary dust cloud is approximately the mass of an asteroid of radius 15 km with density of about 2.5 g/cm straddling the zodiac along the ecliptic this dust cloud is visible as the zodiacal light in a moonless and naturally dark sky and is best seen toward the suns direction during astronomical twilight.nthe pioneer spacecraft observations in the 1970s linked the zodiacal light with the interplanetary dust cloud in earths solar system.nncontentsnnnorigineditnthe sources of interplanetary dust particles idps include at least asteroid collisions cometary activity and collisions in the inner solar system kuiper belt collisions and interstellar medium grains backman d 1997 indeed one of the longest-standing controversies debated in the interplanetary dust community revolves around the relative contributions to the interplanetary dust cloud from asteroid collisions and cometary activity.nnlife cycle of a particleeditnthe main physical processes affecting destruction or expulsion mechanisms interplanetary dust particles are expulsion by radiation pressure inward poynting-robertson pr radiation drag solar wind pressure with significant electromagnetic effects sublimation mutual collisions and the dynamical effects of planets backman d 1997.nthe lifetimes of these dust particles are very short compared to the lifetime of the solar system if one finds grains around a star that is older than about 10,000,000 years then the grains must have been from recently released fragments of larger objects i.e they cannot be leftover grains from the protoplanetary disk backman private communication therefore the grains would be later-generation dust the zodiacal dust in the solar system is 99.9 later-generation dust and 0.1 intruding interstellar medium dust all primordial grains from the solar systems formation were removed long ago.nparticles which are affected primarily by radiation pressure are known as beta meteoroids they are generally less than 1.4 10 g and are pushed outward from the sun into interstellar space.nncloud structureseditnthe interplanetary dust cloud has a complex structure reach w 1997 apart from a background density this includes:nnndust collection on eartheditnin 1951 fred whipple predicted that micrometeorites smaller than 100 micrometers in diameter might be decelerated on impact with the earths upper atmosphere without melting the modern era of laboratory study of these particles began with the stratospheric collection flights of d e brownlee and collaborators in the 1970s using balloons and then u-2 aircraft.nalthough some of the particles found were similar to the material in present-day meteorite collections the nanoporous nature and unequilibrated cosmic-average composition of other particles suggested that they began as fine-grained aggregates of nonvolatile building blocks and cometary ice the interplanetary nature of these particles was later verified by noble gas and solar flare track observations.nin that context a program for atmospheric collection and curation of these particles was developed at johnson space center in texas this stratospheric micrometeorite collection along with presolar grains from meteorites are unique sources of extraterrestrial material not to mention being small astronomical objects in their own right available for study in laboratories today.nnexperimentseditnspacecraft that have carried dust detectors include pioneer 10 pioneer 11 ulysses heliocentric orbit out to the distance of jupiter galileo jupiter orbiter cassini saturn orbiter and new horizons see venetia burney student dust counter.nnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnfurther readingeditnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
