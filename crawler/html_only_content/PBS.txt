in certain states where pbs has members most notably new jersey the service has an estimated national reach of 93.74 of all households in the united states or 292,926,047 americans with at least one television set.npbs stations are commonly operated by nonprofit organizations state agencies local authorities such as municipal boards of education or universities in their city of license this is similar albeit more centralized in states where a licensee owns multiple stations rebroadcasting the main pbs member to the early model of commercial broadcasting in the u.s in which network-affiliated stations were initially owned by companies that owned few to no other television stations elsewhere in the country in some u.s states a group of pbs stations throughout the entire state may be organized into a single regional subnetwork such as alabama public television and the arkansas educational television network in this model pbs programming and other content is distributed by the originating station in the subnetwork to other full-power stations that serve as satellites as well as any low-power translators in other areas of the state some states may be

on their schedule often this assigns a larger proportion of pbs-distributed programming to the primary member station with the secondary members being allowed to carry a lesser amount of program offerings from the services schedule unlike public broadcasters in most other countries pbs cannot own any of the stations that broadcasts its programming therefore it is one of the few television programming bodies that does not have any owned-and-operated stations this is partly due to the origins of the pbs stations themselves and partly due to historical broadcast license issues.nnparticipating stationseditnmost pbs member stations have produced at least some nationally distributed programs current regularly scheduled programming on the pbs national feed is produced by
