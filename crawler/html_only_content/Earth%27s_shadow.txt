earths shadow wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnthis article is about the shadow the earth casts on its atmosphere as viewed from the earth for information about how it or any other shadow extends in space see umbra.n earths shadow blue and the belt of venus pink at dawn seen above the horizon where the sky meets the sea looking west from twin peaks san francisco note the lowest blue-grey area is the surface of the pacific ocean not the sky.nearths shadow or earth shadow is the shadow that earth itself casts onto its atmosphere and into outer space toward the antisolar point during twilight both early dusk and late dawn the shadows visible fringe sometimes called the dark segment or twilight wedge appears in a clear sky as a dark and diffused band low above the horizon.nncontentsnnnappearanceeditn earths shadow and the belt of venus at dusk looking east from the marin headlands just north of san francisco in october 2010.note a thin layer of greyish cloud partially obscures the horizon in this image.nearths shadow cast onto the atmosphere can be viewed during the civil stage of twilight assuming the sky is clear and the horizon is relatively unobstructed the shadows fringe appears as a dark bluish to purplish band that stretches over 180 of the horizon opposite the sun i.e in the eastern sky at dusk and in the western sky at dawn before sunrise earths shadow appears to recede as the sun rises after sunset the shadow appears to rise as the sun sets.nearths shadow is best seen when the horizon is low such as over the sea and when the sky conditions are clear in addition the higher the observers elevation is to view the horizon the sharper the shadow appears.nnbelt of venuseditnmain article belt of venusn full moon rising as seen through the belt of venus a very small part of the earths shadow dark blue is also visible in this image but the horizon here is too high for more of the earths shadow to be seen.na related phenomenon in the same part of the sky is the belt of venus or anti-twilight arch a pinkish band visible above the bluish shade of earths shadow named after the planet venus which when visible is typically located in this region of the sky.nno defined line divides the earths shadow and the belt of venus one colored band blends into the other in the sky.nthe belt of venus is quite a different phenomenon from the afterglow which appears in the geometrically opposite part of the sky.nncoloreditnwhen the sun is near the horizon around sunset or sunrise the sunlight appears reddish this is because the light rays are penetrating an especially thick layer of the atmosphere which works as a filter scattering all but the longer redder wavelengths.nfrom the observers perspective the red sunlight directly illuminates small particles in the lower atmosphere in the sky opposite of the sun the red light is backscattered to the observer which is the reason why the belt of venus appears pink.nthe lower the setting sun descends the less defined the boundary between earths shadow and the belt of venus appears this is because the setting sun now illuminates a thinner part of the upper atmosphere there the red light is not scattered because fewer particles are present and the eye only sees the normal usual blue sky which is due to rayleigh scattering from air molecules eventually both earths shadow and the belt of venus dissolve into the darkness of the night sky.nncolor of lunar eclipseseditnmain article lunar eclipsen a total lunar eclipse on december 21 2010 shows the reddish light falling on the moons surface.nearths shadow is as curved as the planet is and its umbra extends 1,400,000 km 870,000 mi into outer space the antumbra however extends indefinitely when the sun earth and the moon are aligned perfectly or nearly so with earth between the sun and the moon earths shadow falls onto the lunar surface facing the night side of the planet such that the shadow gradually darkens the full moon causing a lunar eclipse.neven during a total lunar eclipse a small amount of sunlight however still reaches the moon this indirect sunlight has been refracted as it passed through earths atmosphere the air molecules and particulates in earths atmosphere scatter the shorter wavelengths of this sunlight thus the longer wavelengths of reddish light reaches the moon in the same way that light at sunset or sunrise appears reddish this weak red illumination gives the eclipsed moon a dimly reddish or copper color.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnn ncategories n
