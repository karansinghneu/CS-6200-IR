british explorers searching for the source of the nile british anglican missionaries arrived in the kingdom of buganda in 1877 a situation which gave rise to the death of the uganda martyrs and were followed by french catholic missionaries in 1879 the british government chartered the imperial british east africa company ibeac to negotiate trade agreements in the region beginning in 1888 from 1886 there were a series of religious wars in buganda initially between muslims and christians and then from 1890 between ba-ingleza protestants and ba-fransa catholics because of civil unrest and financial burdens ibeac claimed that it was unable to maintain their occupation in the region british commercial interests were ardent to protect the trade route of the nile which prompted the british government to annex buganda and adjoining territories to create the uganda protectorate in 1894.nnuganda protectorate 18941962nmain article uganda protectoratenin the 1890s 32,000 labourers from

queen of uganda in october 1963 uganda became a republic but maintained its membership in the commonwealth of nations.nthe first post-independence election held in 1962 was won by an alliance between the uganda peoples congress upc and kabaka yekka ky upc and ky formed the first post-independence government with milton obote as executive prime minister with the buganda kabaka king edward muteesa ii holding the largely ceremonial position of president.nnthe buganda crisis 19621966nn construction of the owen falls dam in jinja.n the uganda printers building on kampala road kampala ugandanugandas immediate post-independence years were dominated by the relationship between the central government and the largest regional kingdom buganda.nfrom the moment the british created the uganda protectorate the issue of how to manage the largest monarchy within the framework of a unitary state had always been a problem colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked this was further complicated by bugandas nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government buganda never sought independence but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the british left this was evidenced in part by hostilities between the british colonial authorities and buganda prior to independence.nwithin buganda there were divisions between those who wanted the kabaka to remain a dominant monarch and those who wanted to join with the rest of uganda to create a modern secular state the split resulted in the creation of two dominant buganda based parties the kabaka yekka kabaka only ky and the democratic party dp that had roots in the catholic church the bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-colonial parliament approached the kabaka particularly disliked the dp leader benedicto kiwanuka.noutside buganda a quiet spoken politician from northern uganda milton obote had forged an alliance of non-buganda politicians to form the uganda peoples congress upc the upc at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured bugandas special status this drew in substantial support from outside buganda the party however remained a loose alliance of interests but obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula.nat independence the buganda question remained unresolved uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament in the pre-independence elections the upc ran no candidates in buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats outside buganda the dp won 24 seats outside buganda the special status granted to buganda meant that the 21 buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the buganda parliament the lukikko ky won a resounding victory over dp winning all 21 seats.nthe upc reached a high at the end of 1964 when the leader of the dp in parliament basil kiiza bataringaya crossed the parliamentary floor with five other mps leaving dp with only nine seats the dp mps were not particularly happy that their leader benedicto kiwanukas hostility towards the kabaka that was hindering their chances of compromise with ky the trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 ky members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the upc was no longer viable obotes charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him and the upc was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside buganda the response from the kabaka was mute probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country however there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against obote by the time uganda had become independent buganda was a divided house with contending social and political forces"nthere were however problems brewing inside the upc as its ranks swelled the ethnic religious regional and personal interests began to shake the party the partys apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures and by 1966 the upc was tearing itself apart the conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from dp and ky.nthe upc delegates arrived in gulu in 1964 for their delegates conference here was the first demonstration as to how obote was losing control of his party the battle over the secretary general of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderates candidate grace ibingira and the radical john kakonge ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to obote within the upc this is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between buganda and the central government for those outside the upc including ky supporters this was a sign that obote was vulnerable keen observers realised the upc was not a cohesive unit.nthe collapse of the upc-ky alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction obote and others had about bugandas special status in 1964 the government responded to demands from some parts of the vast buganda kingdom that they were not the kabakas subjects prior to colonial rule buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring bunyoro kingdom buganda had conquered parts of bunyoro and the british colonialists had formalised this in the buganda agreements known as the lost counties the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of bunyoro obote decided to allow a referendum which angered the kabaka and most of the rest of buganda the residents of the counties voted to return to bunyoro despite the kabakas attempts to influence the vote having lost the referendum ky opposed the bill to pass the counties to bunyoro thus ending the alliance with the upc.nthe tribal nature of ugandan politics was also manifesting itself in government the upc which had previously been a national party began to break along tribal lines when ibingira challenged obote in the upc the north/south ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians a a neykon felix onama alex ojera while ibingiras supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him were mainly from the south george magezi b kirya matthias ngobi in time the two factions acquired ethnic labels bantu the mainly southern ibingira faction and nilotic the mainly northern obote faction the perception that the government was at war with the bantu was further enhanced when obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly bantu ministers who backed ibingira.nthese labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences first buganda the people of buganda are bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the ibingira faction the ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing obote of wanting to overthrow the kabaka they were now aligned to opposing obote second the security forces the british colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from northern uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles at independence the army and police was dominated by northern tribes mainly nilotic they would now feel more affiliated to obote and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power in april 1966 obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at moroto of whom seventy percent came from the northern region.nit is true that at the time there was a tendency to see central government and security forces as dominated by northerners particularly the acholi who through the upc had significant access to government positions at national level in northern uganda there were also varied degrees of anti-buganda feelings particularly over the kingdoms special status before and after independence and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state both through the civil service and military and created a patronage machine in northern uganda however both bantu and nilotic labels represent significant ambiguities the bantu category for example includes both buganda and bunyoro historically bitter rivals the nilotic label includes the lugbara acholi and langi who have bitter rivalries that were to define ugandas military politics later despite these ambiguities these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences ugandan politics.nthe upc fragmentation continued as opponents sensed obotes vulnerability at local level where the upc dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders even in obotes home district attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966 a more worrying fact for the upc was that the next national elections loomed in 1967 and without the support of ky who were now likely to back the dp and the growing factionalism in the upc there was the real possibility that the upc would be out of power in months.nobote went after ky with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by ky to expand outside buganda ky appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining mps the terminally ill daudi ochieng ochieng was an irony although from northern uganda he had risen high in the ranks of ky and become a close confidant to the kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in buganda in obotes absence from parliament ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the congo that had been orchestrated by obotes army chief of staff colonel idi amin he further alleged that obote onama and neykon had all benefited from the scheme parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure amin and investigate obotes involvement this shook the government and raised tensions in the country.nky further demonstrated its ability to challenge obote from within his party at the upc buganda conference where godfrey binaisa the attorney general was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of ky ibingira and other anti-obote elements in buganda obotes response was to arrest ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in february 1966 in march 1966 obote also announced that the offices of president and vice president would cease to exist effectively dismissing the kabaka obote also gave amin more power giving him the army commander position over the previous holder opolot who had relations to buganda through marriage possibly believing opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the kabaka if it came to that obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months obote went on television and radio to accuse the kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the kabaka following the rumours of amin plotting a coup.nobote further dismantled the authority of the kabaka by announcing among other measures:nnnthe lines were now drawn for a show down between buganda and the central government historians may argue about whether this could have been avoided through compromise this was unlikely as obote now felt emboldened and saw the kabaka as weak indeed by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the upc the kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other within bugandas political institutions rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves the kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger buganda politicians who better understood the new post-independence politics unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained the kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists.nin may 1966 the kabaka made his move he asked for foreign help and the buganda parliament demanded that the uganda government leave buganda including the capital kampala in response obote ordered idi amin to attack the kabakas palace the battle for the kabakas palace was fierce the kabakas guards putting up more resistance that had been expected the british trained captain the kabaka with about 120 armed men kept idi amin at bay for twelve hours it is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace the anticipated countryside uprising in buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming obote met the press to relish his victory the kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was scuttled off into exile in london by supporters he died there three years later.nn19661971 before the coupnin 1966 following a power struggle between the obote-led government and king muteesa obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president in 1967 a new
