it is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495570 nm in subtractive color systems used in painting and color printing it is created by a combination of yellow and blue or yellow and cyan in the rgb color model used on television and computer screens it is one of the additive primary colors along with red and blue which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors by far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage several minerals have a green color including the emerald which is colored green by its chromium content.nduring post-classical and early modern europe green was the color commonly associated with wealth merchants bankers and the gentry while red was reserved for the nobility for this reason the costume of the mona lisa by leonardo da vinci and the benches in the british house of commons are green while those in the house of lords are red it also has a long historical tradition as the color of ireland and of gaelic culture it is the historic color of islam representing the lush vegetation of paradise it was the color of the banner of muhammad and is found in the flags of nearly all islamic countries.nin surveys made in american european and islamic countries green is the color most commonly associated with nature life health youth spring hope and envy in the european union and the united states green is also sometimes associated with toxicity and poor health but in china and most of asia its associations are very positive as the symbol of fertility and happiness because of its association with nature it is the color of the environmental movement political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the green movement some naming themselves green parties this has led to similar campaigns in advertising as companies have sold green or environmentally friendly products green is also the traditional color of safety and permission a green light

grownthe word green comes from the middle english and old english word grene which like the german word grn has the same root as the words grass and grow it is from a common germanic gronja which is also reflected in old norse grnn old high german gruoni but unattested in east germanic ultimately from a pie root ghre to grow and root-cognate with grass and to grow.nthe first recorded use of the word as a color term in old english dates to ca ad 700.nlatin with viridis also has a genuine and widely used term for green related to virere to grow and ver spring it gave rise to words in several romance languages french vert italian verde and english vert verdure etc likewise the slavic languages with zelen ancient greek also had a term for yellowish pale green chloros cf the color of chlorine cognate with verdant and the green of new growth".nthus the languages mentioned above germanic romance slavic greek have old terms for green which are derived from words for fresh sprouting vegetation.nhowever comparative linguistics makes clear that these terms were coined independently over the past few millennia and there is no identifiable single proto-indo-european or word for green for example the slavic zelen is cognate with sanskrit hari yellow ochre golden".nthe turkic languages also have jal green or yellowish green compared to a mongolian word for meadow".nnlanguages where green and blue are one colornmain article color termnin some languages including old chinese thai old japanese and vietnamese the same word can mean either blue or green the chinese character pronounced qng in mandarin ao in japanese and thanh in sino-vietnamese has a meaning that covers both blue and green blue and green are traditionally considered shades of in more contemporary terms they are ln in mandarin and l in mandarin respectively japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green midori which is derived from the classical japanese descriptive verb midoru to be in leaf to flourish in reference to trees and guriin which is derived from the english word green however in japan although the traffic lights have the same colors as other countries have the green light is described using the same word as for blue aoi because green is considered a shade of aoi similarly green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples green shiso as opposed to red apples and red shiso will be described with the word aoi vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green xanh with variants such as xanh da tri azure lit sky blue lam blue and lc green also xanh l cy lit leaf green".n"green in modern european languages corresponds to about 520570 nm but many historical and non-european languages make other choices e.g using a term for the range of ca 450530 nm blue/green and another for ca 530590 nm green/yellow in the comparative study of color terms in the worlds languages green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors white black red green yellow and blue or more rarely in systems with five colors white red yellow green and black/blue see distinction of green from blue these languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote green but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms much like the english adjective orange being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit thus the thai word kheyw besides meaning green also means rank and smelly and holds other unpleasant associations.nthe celtic languages had a term for blue/green/grey proto-celtic glasto which gave rise to old irish glas green grey and to welsh glas blue this word is cognate with the ancient greek bluish green contrasting with yellowish green discussed above.nin modern japanese the term for green is while the old term for blue/green blue ao now means blue but in certain contexts green is still conventionally referred to as as in blue traffic light ao shing and blue leaves aoba reflecting the absence of blue-green distinction in old japanese more accurately the traditional japanese color terminology grouped some shades of green with blue and others with yellow tones.nthe persian language is traditionally lacking a black/blue/green distinction the persian word sabz can mean green black or dark thus persian erotic poetry dark-skinned women are addressed as sabz-eh as in phrases like sabz-eh-gandom-gun literally dark wheat colored or sabz-eh-malih a dark beauty similarly in sudanese arabic dark-skinned people are described as akhar the term which in standard arabic stands unambiguously for green".nnin nature and culturenmain article shades of greennnin sciencencolor vision and colorimetrynn green blue and red are additive colors all the colors you see on your computer screen are made by mixing them in different intensities.nin optics the perception of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 495570 nm the sensitivity of the dark-adapted human eye is greatest at about 507 nm a blue-green color while the light-adapted eye is most sensitive about 555 nm a yellow-green these are the peak locations of the rod and cone scotopic and photopic respectively luminosity functions.nthe perception of greenness in opposition to redness forming one of the opponent mechanisms in human color vision is evoked by light which triggers the medium-wavelength m cone cells in the eye more than the long-wavelength l cones light which triggers this greenness response more than the yellowness or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green a green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487570 nm.nhuman eyes have color receptors known as cone cells of which there are three types in some cases one is missing or faulty which can cause color blindness including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green known as deuteranopia or redgreen color blindness green is restful to the eye studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.nin the subtractive color system used in painting and color printing green is created by a combination of yellow and blue or yellow and cyan in the rgb color model used on television and computer screens it is one of the additive primary colors along with red and blue which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors on the hsv color wheel also known as the rgb color wheel the complement of green is magenta that is a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light one of the purples on a traditional color wheel based on subtractive color the complementary color to green is considered to be red.nin additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions one of the primary light sources is typically a narrow-spectrum yellowish-green of dominant wavelength 550 nm this green primary is combined with an orangish-red red primary and a purplish-blue blue primary to produce any color in between the rgb color model a unique green green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary.nnlasersnlasers emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers green laser pointers outputting at 532 nm 563.5 thz are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness the most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state dpss technology to create the green light an infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide nd:yvo4 or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet nd:yag and induces it to emit 281.76 thz 1064 nm this deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium titanium and phosphorus ktp whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam 563.5 thz in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532 nm green other green wavelengths are also available using dpss technology ranging from 501 nm to 543 nm green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers including the heliumneon laser 543 nm the argon-ion laser 514 nm and the krypton-ion laser 521 nm and 531 nm as well as liquid dye lasers green lasers have a wide variety of applications including pointing illumination surgery laser light shows spectroscopy interferometry fluorescence holography machine vision non-lethal weapons and bird control.nas of mid-2011 direct green laser diodes at 510 nm and 500 nm have become generally available although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use the efficiency of these lasers peak 3 compared to that of dpss green lasers peak 35 may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses.nnpigments food coloring and fireworksn the chicago river is dyed green every year to mark st patricks daynmany minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries pigments in this case are minerals which reflect the color green rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities the large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all among the more notable green minerals however is the emerald which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium chromiumiii oxide cro is called chrome green also called viridian or institutional green when used as a pigment for many years the source of amazonites color was a mystery widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors the blue-green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar copper is the source of the green color in malachite pigments chemically known as basic copperii carbonate.nverdigris is made by placing a plate or blade of copper brass or bronze slightly warmed into a vat of fermenting wine leaving it there for several weeks and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal the process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by pliny it was used by the romans in the murals of pompeii and in celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century ad it produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate but it had drawbacks it was unstable it could not resist dampness it did not mix well with other colors it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact and it was toxic leonardo da vinci in his treatise on painting warned artists not to use it it was widely used in miniature paintings in europe and persia in the 16th and 17th centuries its use largely ended in the late 19th century when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green viridian also called chrome green is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate was patented in 1859 it became popular with painters since unlike other synthetic greens it was stable and not toxic vincent van gogh used it along with prussian blue to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting cafe terrace at night.ngreen

can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate smoke can be turned green by a mixture solvent yellow 33 solvent green 3 lactose magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate.nnnbiologynngreen is common in nature as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll which is involved in photosynthesis chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light red and short wavelengths of light blue much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye so light reflected by plants is enriched in green chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple halobacteria were already exploiting photosynthesis their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using bacteriorhodopsin the new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the halobacteria.nn a green mambananimals typically use the color green as camouflage blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment green animals include especially amphibians reptiles and some fish birds and insects most fish reptiles amphibians and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over-layer of yellow pigment perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment for example broadleaf forests typically have a yellow-green light about them as the trees filter the light turacoverdin is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds especially invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments sometimes caused by diet this can causes their feces to look green as well other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins lychochromes and hemanovadin humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields substances that may impart a greenish hue to ones skin include biliverdin the green pigment in bile and ceruloplasmin a protein that carries copper ions in chelation.nthe
