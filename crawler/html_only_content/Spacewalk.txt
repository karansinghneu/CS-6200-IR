to a spacewalk made outside a craft orbiting earth such as the international space station but also has applied to lunar surface exploration commonly known as moonwalks performed by six pairs of american astronauts in the apollo program from 1969 to 1972 on each of the last three of these missions astronauts also performed deep-space evas on the return to earth to retrieve film canisters from the outside of the spacecraft astronauts also used eva in 1973 to repair launch damage to skylab the united states first space station.na stand-up eva seva is when an astronaut does not fully leave a spacecraft but is completely reliant on the spacesuit for environmental support its name derives from the astronaut standing up in the open hatch usually to record or assist a spacewalking astronaut.nevas may be either tethered the astronaut is connected to the spacecraft oxygen and electrical power can be supplied through an umbilical cable no propulsion is needed to return to the spacecraft or untethered untethered spacewalks were only performed on three missions in 1984 using the manned maneuvering unit mmu and on a flight test in 1994 of the simplified aid for eva rescue safer a safety device worn on tethered u.s evas.nthe soviet union/russia the united states and china have conducted evas.nncontentsnnndevelopment historyeditnnasa planners invented the term extravehicular activity abbreviated with the acronym eva in the early 1960s for the apollo program to land men on the moon because the astronauts would leave the spacecraft to collect lunar material samples and deploy scientific experiments to support this and other apollo objectives the gemini program was spun off to develop the capability for astronauts to work outside a two-man earth orbiting spacecraft however the soviet union was fiercely competitive in holding the early lead it had gained in manned spaceflight so the soviet communist party led by nikita khrushchev ordered the conversion of its single-pilot vostok capsule into a two or three-person craft named voskhod in order to compete with gemini and apollo the soviets were able to launch two voskhod capsules before u.s was able to launch its first manned gemini.nthe voskhods avionics required cooling by cabin air to prevent overheating therefore an airlock was required for the spacewalking cosmonaut to exit and re-enter the cabin while it remained pressurized by contrast the gemini avionics did not require air cooling allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch because of this the american and soviet space programs developed different definitions for the duration of an eva the soviet now russian definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in vacuum an american eva began when the astronaut had at least his head outside the spacecraft the usa has changed its eva definition since.nnfirst spacewalkeditn alexei leonov performs the first spacewalk during voskhod 2 march 1965nthe first eva was performed on march 18 1965 by soviet cosmonaut alexey leonov who spent 12 minutes outside the voskhod 2 spacecraft carrying a white metal backpack containing 45 minutes worth of breathing and pressurization oxygen leonov had no means to control his motion other than pulling on his 15.35 m 50.4 ft tether after the flight he claimed this was easy but his space suit ballooned from its internal pressure against the vacuum of space stiffening so much that he could not activate the shutter on his chest-mounted camera.nat the end of his space walk the suit stiffening caused a more serious problem leonov had to re-enter the capsule through the inflatable cloth airlock 1.2 m 3 ft 11 in in diameter and 2.5 m 8 ft 2 in long he improperly entered the airlock head-first and got stuck sideways he could not get back in without reducing the pressure in his suit risking the bends this added another 12 minutes to his time in vacuum and he was overheated by 1.8 c 3.2 f from the exertion it would be almost four years before the soviets tried another eva they misrepresented to the press how difficult leonov found it to work in weightlessness and concealed the problems encountered until after the end of the cold war.nnproject geminieditn ed white performs the first american spacewalk during gemini iv june 1965.nthe first american spacewalk was performed on june 3 1965 by ed white from the second manned gemini flight gemini 4 for 21 minutes white was tethered to the spacecraft and his oxygen was supplied through a 25-foot 7.6 m umbilical which also carried communications and biomedical instrumentation he was the first to control his motion in space with a hand-held maneuvering unit which worked well but only carried enough propellant for 20 seconds white found his tether useful for limiting his distance from the spacecraft but difficult to use for moving around contrary to leonovs claim however a defect in the capsules hatch latching mechanism caused difficulties opening and closing the hatch which delayed the start of the eva and put white and his crewmate at risk of not getting back to earth alive.nno evas were planned on the next three gemini flights the next eva was planned to be made by david scott on gemini 8 but that mission had to be aborted due to a critical spacecraft malfunction before the eva could be conducted astronauts on the next three gemini flights eugene cernan michael collins and richard gordon performed several evas but none was able to successfully work for long periods outside the spacecraft without tiring and overheating cernan attempted but failed to test an air force astronaut maneuvering unit which included a self-contained oxygen system.non november 13 1966 edwin buzz aldrin became the first to successfully work in space without tiring on the gemini 12 last flight aldrin worked outside the spacecraft for 2 hours and 6 minutes in addition to two stand-up evas in the spacecraft hatch for an additional 3 hours and 24 minutes aldrins interest in scuba diving inspired the use of underwater eva training to simulate weightlessness which has been used ever since to allow astronauts to practice techniques of avoiding wasted muscle energy.nnfirst eva crew transfereditnon january 16 1969 soviet cosmonauts aleksei yeliseyev and yevgeny khrunov transferred from soyuz 5 to soyuz 4 which were docked together this was the second soviet eva and it would be almost another nine years before the soviets performed their third.nnapollo lunar evaeditn buzz aldrin walks on the moon during the pioneering apollo 11 mission in 1969namerican astronauts neil armstrong and buzz aldrin performed the first eva on the lunar surface on july 21 1969 utc after landing their apollo 11 lunar module spacecraft this first moon walk using self-contained portable life support systems lasted 2 hours 36 minutes a total of fifteen moon walks were performed among six apollo crews including charles pete conrad alan bean alan shepard edgar mitchell david scott james irwin john young charles duke eugene cernan and harrison jack schmitt cernan was the last apollo astronaut to step off the surface of the moon.nnplay media charles duke with a hammer on the lunar surface.napollo 15 command module pilot al worden made an eva on august 5 1971 on the return trip from the moon to retrieve a film and data recording canister from the service module he was assisted by lunar module pilot james irwin standing up in the command module hatch this procedure was repeated by ken mattingly and charles duke on apollo 16 and by ronald evans and harrison schmitt on apollo 17.nnpost-apollo evaseditnthe first eva repairs of a spacecraft were made by charles pete conrad joseph kerwin and paul j weitz on may 26 june 7 and june 19 1973 on the skylab 2 mission they rescued the functionality of the launch-damaged skylab space station by freeing a stuck solar panel deploying a solar heating shield and freeing a stuck circuit breaker relay the skylab 2 crew made three evas and a total of ten evas were made by the three skylab crews they found that activities in weightlessness required about 2 times longer than on earth because many astronauts suffered spacesickness early in their flights.nafter skylab no more evas were made by the united states until the advent of the space shuttle program in the early 1980s in this period the soviets resumed evas making four from the salyut 6 and salyut 7 space stations between december 20 1977 and july 30 1982.nwhen the united states resumed evas on april 7 1983 astronauts started using an extravehicular mobility unit emu for self-contained life support independent of the spacecraft sts-6 was the first space shuttle mission during which a spacewalk was conducted also for the first time american astronauts used an airlock to enter and exit the spacecraft like the soviets accordingly the american definition of eva start time was redefined to when the astronaut switches the emu to battery power.nnchinese evaeditnchina became the third country to independently carry out an eva on september 27 2008 during the shenzhou 7 mission chinese astronaut zhai zhigang completed a spacewalk wearing the chinese-developed feitian space suit with astronaut liu boming wearing the russian-derived orlan space suit to help him zhai completely exited the craft while liu stood by at the airlock straddling the portal.nnmilestoneseditnncapability milestoneseditnnnn untethered u.s astronaut bruce mccandless uses a

shuttle program were designated as ev-1 ev-2 ev-3 and ev-4 assigned to mission specialists for each mission if applicable.nncamp-out procedureeditnfor evas from the international space station nasa now routinely employs a camp-out procedure to reduce the risk of decompression sickness this was first tested by the expedition 12 crew during a camp out astronauts sleep overnight in the airlock prior to an eva lowering the air pressure to 10.2 psi 70 kpa compared to the normal station pressure of 14.7 psi 101 kpa spending a night at the lower air pressure helps flush nitrogen from the body thereby preventing the bends more recently astronauts have been using the in-suit light exercise protocol rather than camp-out to prevent decompression sickness.nnsee
