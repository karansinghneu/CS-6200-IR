space habitat wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn a pair of oneill cylindersn interior view of an oneill cylinder showing alternating land and window stripesna space habitat also called a space colony space settlement orbital habitat orbital settlement or orbital colony is a type of space station intended as a permanent settlement rather than as a simple way-station or other specialized facility no space habitat has been constructed yet but many design concepts with varying degrees of realism have come both from engineers and from science-fiction authors.nthe term space habitat sometimes includes more broadly colonies built on or in a body other than earth such as the moon mars or an asteroid this article concentrates on self-contained structures envisaged for micro-g environments.nncontentsnnnmotivationeditn a stanford torus interiorn stanford torus exteriornseveral motivations for building space colonies have been proposed:nnnsee reasons for space colonization or space and survival.nnadvantageseditna number of arguments are made for space habitats having a number of advantages:nnaccess to solar energyeditnspace has an abundance of light produced from the sun in earth orbit this amounts to 1400 watts of power per square meter this energy can be used to produce electricity from solar cells or heat engine based power stations process ores provide light for plants to grow and to warm space colonies.nnoutside gravity welleditnearth-to-space habitat trade would be easier than earth-to-planetary colony trade as colonies orbiting earth will not have a gravity well to overcome to export to earth and a smaller gravity well to overcome to import from earth.nnin-situ resource utilizationeditnspace habitats may be supplied with resources from extraterrestrial places like mars asteroids or the moon in-situ resource utilization isru see asteroid mining one could produce breathing oxygen drinking water and rocket fuel with the help of isru it may become possible to manufacture solar panels from lunar materials.nnasteroids and other small bodieseditnmost asteroids have a mixture of materials that could be mined and because these bodies do not have substantial gravity wells it would require low delta-v to draw materials from them and haul them to a construction site.nthere is estimated to be enough material in the main asteroid belt alone to build enough space habitats to equal the habitable surface area of 3,000 earths.nnpopulationeditna 1974 estimate assumed that collection of all the material in the main asteroid belt would allow habitats may be constructed to give an immense total population capacity using the free-floating resources of the solar system this estimate extended into the trillions.nnzero g recreationeditnif a large area at the rotation axis is enclosed various zero-g sports are possible including swimming hang gliding and the use of human-powered aircraft.nnpassenger compartmenteditna space habitat can be the passenger compartment of a large spacecraft for colonizing asteroids moons and planets it can also function as one for a generation ship for travel to other planets see space and survival or distant stars l r shepherd described a generation starship in 1952 comparing it to a small planet with many people living in it.nnrequirementseditn the airglow above the horizon captured from the iss.nthe requirements for a space habitat are many they would have to provide all the material needs for hundreds or thousands of humans in an environment out in space that is very hostile to human life.nnatmosphereeditnair pressure with normal partial pressures of oxygen21 carbon dioxide and nitrogen78 is a basic requirement of any space habitat basically most space colony designs concepts envision large thin-walled pressure vessels the required oxygen could be obtained from lunar rock nitrogen is most easily available from the earth but is also recycled nearly perfectly also nitrogen in the form of ammonia nh may be obtainable from comets and the moons of outer planets nitrogen may also be available in unknown quantities on certain other bodies in the outer solar system the air of a colony could be recycled in a number of ways one concept is to use photosynthetic gardens possibly via hydroponics or forest gardening however these do not remove certain industrial pollutants such as volatile oils and excess simple molecular gases the standard method used on nuclear submarines a similar form of closed environment is to use a catalytic burner which effectively decomposes most organics further protection might be provided by a small cryogenic distillation system which would gradually remove impurities such as mercury vapor and noble gases that cannot be catalytically burned.nnfood productioneditnorganic materials for food production would also need to be provided at first most of these would have to be imported from earth after that feces recycling should reduce the need for imports one proposed recycling method would start by burning the cryogenic distillate plants garbage and sewage with air in an electric arc and distilling the result the resulting carbon dioxide and water would be immediately usable in agriculture the nitrates and salts in the ash could be dissolved in water and separated into pure minerals most of the nitrates potassium and sodium salts would recycle as fertilizers other minerals containing iron nickel and silicon could be chemically purified in batches and reused industrially the small fraction of remaining materials well below 0.01 by weight could be processed into pure elements with zero-gravity mass spectrometry and added in appropriate amounts to the fertilizers and industrial stocks it is likely that methods would be greatly refined as people began to actually live in space habitats.nnartificial gravityeditnmain article artificial gravitynnlong-term on-orbit studies have proven that zero gravity weakens bones and muscles and upsets calcium metabolism and immune systems most people have a continual stuffy nose or sinus problems and a few people have dramatic incurable motion sickness most colony designs would rotate in order to use inertial forces to simulate gravity nasa studies with chickens and plants have proven that this is an effective physiological substitute for gravity turning ones head rapidly in such an environment causes a tilt to be sensed as ones inner ears move at different rotational rates centrifuge studies show that people get motion-sick in habitats with a rotational radius of less than 100 metres or with a rotation rate above 3 rotations per minute however the same studies and statistical inference indicate that almost all people should be able to live comfortably in habitats with a rotational radius larger than 500 meters and below 1 rpm experienced persons were not merely more resistant to motion sickness but could also use the effect to determine spinward and antispinward directions in the centrifuges.nnprotection from radiationeditn langleys mars ice dome design from 2016 for a mars base uses frozen water to enhance protectionnsome very large space habitat designs could be effectively shielded from cosmic rays by their structure and air smaller habitats could be shielded by stationary nonrotating bags of rock sunlight could be admitted indirectly via mirrors in radiation-proof louvres which would function in the same manner as a periscope.nnnnheat rejectioneditnthe colony is in a vacuum and therefore resembles a giant thermos bottle habitats also need a radiator to eliminate heat from absorbed sunlight very small habitats might have a central vane that rotates with the colony in this design convection would raise hot air up toward the center and cool air would fall down into the outer habitat some other designs would distribute coolants such as chilled water from a central radiator.nnmeteoroids and dusteditnthe habitat would need to withstand potential impacts from space debris meteoroids dust etc most meteoroids that strike the earth vaporize in the atmosphere without a thick protective atmosphere meteoroid strikes would pose a much greater risk to a space habitat radar will sweep the space around each habitat mapping the trajectory of debris and other man-made objects and allowing corrective actions to be taken to protect the habitat.nin some designs oneill/nasa ames stanford torus and crystal palace in a hatbox habitat designs have a non-rotating cosmic ray shield of packed sand 1.9m thick or even artificial aggregate rock 1.7m ersatz concrete other proposals use the rock as structure and integral shielding oneill the high frontier sheppard concrete space colonies spaceflight journal of the b.i.s in any of these cases strong meteoroid protection is implied by the external radiation shell 4.5tonnes of rock material per square meter.nsuggestions have been made to layer such protections around a habitat multiple thicknesses up to such protection to equal an earth city which after all is completely vulnerable to total obliteration at any second without notice under the open sky a small rock such as hit near chelyabinsk in 2013 being too numerous and hard to detect for any mitigation scenario or advance warning with such a shell mass of a colony goes up sharply but it is only dumb structure possibly non-rotating and rock-dust as industrial slag is a free left-over from processing regolith for metals or volatiles extraction.nnote that solar power satellites are proposed in the multi-gw ranges and such energies and technologies would allow constant radar mapping of nearby 3d space out-to arbitrarily far away limited only by effort expended to do so.nproposals are available to move even kilometer-sized neos to high earth orbits and reaction engines for such purposes would move a space colony and any arbitrarily large shield but not in any timely or rapid manner the thrust being very low compared to the huge mass.nnattitude controleditnmost mirror geometries require something on the habitat to be aimed at the sun and so attitude control is necessary the original oneill design used the two cylinders as momentum wheels to roll the colony and pushed the sunward pivots together or apart to use precession to change their angle.nnconsiderationseditninitial capital outlayeditneven the smallest of the habitat designs mentioned below are more massive than the total mass of all items that humans have ever launched into earth orbit combined prerequisites to building habitats are either cheaper launch costs or a mining and manufacturing base on the moon or other body having low delta-v from the desired habitat location.nnlocationeditnthe optimal habitat orbits are still debated and so orbital stationkeeping is probably a commercial issue the lunar l and l orbits are now thought to be too far away from the moon and earth a more modern proposal is to use a two-to-one resonance orbit that alternately has a close low-energy cheap approach to the moon and then to the earth this provides quick inexpensive access to both raw materials and the major market most colony designs plan to use electromagnetic tether propulsion or mass drivers used as rocket motors the advantage of these is that they either use no reaction mass at all or use cheap reaction mass.nnconceptual studieseditn description of a rotating wheel space station in hermann noordungs the problem of space travel 1929noneill the high frontiereditnaround 1970 near the end of project apollo 1961-1972 gerard k oneill an experimental physicist at princeton university was looking for a topic to tempt his physics students most of them freshmen in engineering he hit upon the idea of assigning them feasibility calculations for large space-habitats to his surprise the habitats seemed feasible even in very large sizes cylinders 8 km 5 mi in diameter and 32 km 20 mi long even if made from ordinary materials such as steel and glass also the students solved problems such as radiation protection from cosmic rays almost free in the larger sizes getting naturalistic sun angles provision of power realistic pest-free farming and orbital attitude control without reaction motors oneill published an article about these colony concepts in physics today in 1974 see the above illustration of such a colony a classic oneill colony he expanded the article in his 1976 book the high frontier human colonies in space.nnnasa ames/stanford 1975 summer studyeditnthe result motivated nasa to sponsor a couple of summer workshops led by oneill several concepts were studied with sizes ranging from 1,000 to 10,000,000 people including versions of the stanford torus three concepts were presented to nasa the bernal sphere the toroidal colony and the cylindrical colony.noneills concepts had an example of a payback scheme construction of solar power satellites from lunar materials oneill did not emphasize the building of solar power satellites as such but rather offered proof that orbital manufacturing from lunar materials could generate profits he and other participants presumed that once such manufacturing facilities had started production many profitable uses for them would be found and the colony would become self-supporting and begin to build other colonies as well.nthe concept studies generated a notable groundswell of public interest one effect of this expansion was the founding of the l5 society in the u.s a group of enthusiasts that desired to build and live in such colonies the group was named after the space-colony orbit which was then believed to be the most profitable a kidney-shaped orbit around either of earths lunar lagrange points 5 or 4.nnspace studies instituteeditnin 1977 oneill founded the space studies institute which initially funded and constructed some prototypes of the new hardware needed for a space colonization effort as well as producing a number of feasibility studies one of the early projects for instance involved a series of functional prototypes of a mass driver the essential technology for moving ores efficiently from the moon to space colony orbits.nnnasa conceptseditnsome nasa concept studies included:nnnother conceptseditnngalleryeditnncurrent projectseditnthe following projects and proposals while not truly space habitats incorporate aspects of what they would have and may represent stepping stones towards eventually building of space habitats.nthe nautilus-x multi-mission space exploration vehicle mmsev this 2011 nasa proposal for a long-duration crewed space transport vehicle included an artificial gravity compartment intended to promote crew-health for a crew of up to six persons on missions of up to two years duration the partial-g torus-ring centrifuge would utilize both standard metal-frame and inflatable spacecraft structures and would provide 0.11 to 0.69g if built with the 40 feet 12 m diameter option.nthe iss centrifuge demo also proposed in 2011 as a demonstration project preparatory to the final design of the larger torus centrifuge space habitat for the multi-mission space exploration vehicle the structure would have an outside diameter of 30 feet 9.1 m with a 30 inches 760 mm ring interior cross-section diameter and would provide 0.08 to 0.51g partial gravity this test and evaluation centrifuge would have the capability to become a sleep module for iss crew.nthe bigelow commercial space station was announced in mid-2010 the initial build-out of the station is expected in 2014/2015 bigelow has publicly shown space station design configurations with up to nine modules containing 100,000 cu ft 2,800 m of habitable space bigelow began to publicly refer to the initial configuration as space complex alpha in october 2010.nnhistoryeditnthe idea of space habitats either in fact or fiction goes back to the second half of the 19th century the brick moon a fictional story written in 1869 by edward everett hale is perhaps the first treatment of this idea in writing in 1903 space pioneer konstantin tsiolkovsky speculated about rotating cylindrical space colonies with plants fed by the sun in beyond planet earth in the 1920s john desmond bernal and others speculated about giant space habitats dandridge m cole in the late 1950s and 1960s speculated about hollowing out asteroids and then rotating them to use as settlements in various magazine articles and books notably islands in space the challenge of the planetoids.nnin fictioneditnthe space habitats have inspired a large number of fictional societies in science fiction some of the most popular and recognizable are in the japanese gundam universe the space station deep space nine and the space station babylon 5.nthe 2013 science-fiction movie elysium takes place on both a ravaged earth and a luxurious rotating wheel space station called elysium.nin the 2014 epic film interstellar the main character joseph cooper wakes up on a space station orbiting saturn toward the movies climax.nnsee
