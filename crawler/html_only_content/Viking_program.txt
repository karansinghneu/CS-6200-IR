viking program wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnthis article is about the nasa mars probes for the swedish spacecraft see viking satellite.nnnnthe viking program consisted of a pair of american space probes sent to mars viking 1 and viking 2 each spacecraft was composed of two main parts an orbiter designed to photograph the surface of mars from orbit and a lander designed to study the planet from the surface the orbiters also served as communication relays for the landers once they touched down.nthe viking program grew from nasas earlier even more ambitious voyager mars program which was not related to the successful voyager deep space probes of the late 1970s viking 1 was launched on august 20 1975 and the second craft viking 2 was launched on september 9 1975 both riding atop titan iiie rockets with centaur upper stages viking 1 entered mars orbit on june 19 1976 with viking 2 following suit on august 7.nafter orbiting mars for more than a month and returning images used for landing site selection the orbiters and landers detached the landers then entered the martian atmosphere and soft-landed at the sites that had been chosen the viking 1 lander touched down on the surface of mars on july 20 1976 and was joined by the viking 2 lander on september 3 the orbiters continued imaging and performing other scientific operations from orbit while the landers deployed instruments on the surface.nthe project cost roughly us$1 billion in 1970s dollars equivalent to about 5 billion usd in 2016 dollars the mission was considered successful and is credited with helping to form most of the body of knowledge about mars through the late 1990s and early 2000s.nncontentsnnnscience objectiveseditnnviking orbiterseditnthe primary objectives of the two viking orbiters were to transport the landers to mars perform reconnaissance to locate and certify landing sites act as communications relays for the landers and to perform their own scientific investigations each orbiter based on the earlier mariner 9 spacecraft was an octagon approximately 2.5 m across the fully fueled orbiter-lander pair had a mass of 3527 kg after separation and landing the lander had a mass of about 600 kg and the orbiter 900 kg the total launch mass was 2328 kg of which 1445 kg were propellant and attitude control gas the eight faces of the ring-like structure were 0.4572 m high and were alternately 1.397 and 0.508 m wide the overall height was 3.29 m from the lander attachment points on the bottom to the launch vehicle attachment points on top there were 16 modular compartments 3 on each of the 4 long faces and one on each short face four solar panel wings extended from the axis of the orbiter the distance from tip to tip of two oppositely extended solar panels was 9.75 m.nnpropulsioneditnthe main propulsion unit was mounted above the orbiter bus propulsion was furnished by a bipropellant monomethylhydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide liquid-fueled rocket engine which could be gimballed up to 9 degrees the engine was capable of 1,323 n 297 lbf thrust translating to a change in velocity of 1480 m/s attitude control was achieved by 12 small compressed-nitrogen jets.nnnavigation and communicationeditnan acquisition sun sensor a cruise sun sensor a canopus star tracker and an inertial reference unit consisting of six gyroscopes allowed three-axis stabilization two accelerometers were also on board communications were accomplished through a 20 w s-band 2.3 ghz transmitter and two 20 w twtas an x band 8.4 ghz downlink was also added specifically for radio science and to conduct communications experiments uplink was via s band 2.1 ghz a two-axis steerable parabolic dish antenna with a diameter of approximately 1.5 m was attached at one edge of the orbiter base and a fixed low-gain antenna extended from the top of the bus two tape recorders were each capable of storing 1280 megabits a 381-mhz relay radio was also available.nnpowereditnthe power to the two orbiter craft was provided by eight 1.57 1.23 m solar panels two on each wing the solar panels comprised a total of 34,800 solar cells and produced 620 w of power at mars power was also stored in two nickel-cadmium 30-ah batteries.nthe combined area of the four panels was 15 square meters 160 square feet and they provided both regulated and unregulated direct current power unregulated power was provided to the radio transmitter and the lander.ntwo 30-amp-hour nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries provided power when the spacecraft was not facing the sun and during launch correction maneuvers and mars occultation.nnmain findingseditn mars image mosaic from the viking 1 orbiternby discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water the images from the orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on mars huge river valleys were found in many areas they showed that floods of water broke through dams carved deep valleys eroded grooves into bedrock and travelled thousands of kilometers large areas in the southern hemisphere contained branched stream networks suggesting that rain once fell the flanks of some volcanoes are believed to have been exposed to rainfall because they resemble those caused on hawaiian volcanoes many craters look as if the impactor fell into mud when they were formed ice in the soil may have melted turned the ground into mud then flowed across the surface normally material from an impact goes up then down it does not flow across the surface going around obstacles as it does on some martian craters regions called chaotic terrain seemed to have quickly lost great volumes of water causing large channels to be formed the amount of water involved was estimated to ten thousand times the flow of the mississippi river underground volcanism may have melted frozen ice the water then flowed away and the ground collapsed to leave chaotic terrain.nnnviking mosaicsnviking landerseditn carl sagan with a model of a viking lander.n artists concept depicting a viking lander on the surface of mars.neach lander comprised a six-sided aluminium base with alternate 1.09 and 0.56 m 3 ft 7 in and 1 ft 10 in long sides supported on three extended legs attached to the shorter sides the leg footpads formed the vertices of an equilateral triangle with 2.21 m 7 ft 3 in sides when viewed from above with the long sides of the base forming a straight line with the two adjoining footpads instrumentation was attached inside and on top of the base elevated above the surface by the extended legs.neach lander was enclosed in an aeroshell heat shield designed to slow the lander down during the entry phase to prevent contamination of mars by earth organisms each lander upon assembly and enclosure within the aeroshell was enclosed in a pressurized bioshield and then sterilized at a temperature of 111 c 232 f for 40 hours for thermal reasons the cap of the bioshield was jettisoned after the centaur upper stage powered the viking orbiter/lander combination out of earth orbit.nndescent and landingeditneach lander arrived at mars attached to the orbiter the assembly orbited mars many times before the lander was released and separated from the orbiter for descent to the surface descent comprised four distinct phases starting with a deorbit burn the lander then experienced atmospheric entry with peak heating occurring a few seconds after the start of frictional heating with the martian atmosphere at an altitude of about 6 kilometers 3.7 miles and traveling at a velocity of 900 kilometers per hour 600 mph the parachute deployed the aeroshell released and the landers legs unfolded at an altitude of about 1.5 kilometers 5,000 feet the lander activated its three retro-engines and was released from the parachute the lander then immediately used retrorockets to slow and control its descent with a soft landing on the surface of mars.nnn first clear image ever transmitted from the surface of mars shows rocks near the viking 1 lander july 20 1976.nnpropulsioneditnpropulsion for deorbit was provided by the monopropellant hydrazine nh through a rocket with 12 nozzles arranged in four clusters of three that provided 32 newtons 7.2 lb thrust translating to a change in velocity of 180 m/s 590 ft/s these nozzles also acted as the control thrusters for translation and rotation of the lander.nterminal descent after use of a parachute and landing utilized three one affixed on each long side of the base separated by 120 degrees monopropellant hydrazine engines the engines had 18 nozzles to disperse the exhaust and minimize effects on the ground and were throttleable from 276 to 2,667 newtons 62 to 600 lb the hydrazine was purified in order to prevent contamination of the martian surface with earth microbes the lander carried 85 kg 187 lb of propellant at launch contained in two spherical titanium tanks mounted on opposite sides of the lander beneath the rtg windscreens giving a total launch mass of 657 kg 1,448 lb control was achieved through the use of an inertial reference unit four gyros a radar altimeter a terminal descent and landing radar and the control thrusters.nnpowereditnpower was provided by two radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg units containing plutonium-238 affixed to opposite sides of the lander base and covered by wind screens each generator was 28 cm 11 in tall 58 cm 23 in in diameter had a mass of 13.6 kg 30 lb and provided 30 watts continuous power at 4.4 volts four wet cell sealed nickel-cadmium 8 ampere-hours 28,800 coulombs 28 volts rechargeable batteries were also on board to handle peak power loads.nnpayloadeditn image from mars taken by the viking 2 landerncommunications were accomplished through a 20-watt s-band transmitter using two traveling-wave tubes a two-axis steerable high-gain parabolic antenna was mounted on a boom near one edge of the lander base an omnidirectional low-gain s-band antenna also extended from the base both these antennae allowed for communication directly with the earth permitting viking 1 to continue to work long after both orbiters had failed a uhf 381 mhz antenna provided a one-way relay to the orbiter using a 30 watt relay radio data storage was on a 40-mbit tape recorder and the lander computer had a 6000-word memory for command instructions.nthe lander carried instruments to achieve the primary scientific objectives of the lander mission to study the biology chemical composition organic and inorganic meteorology seismology magnetic properties appearance and physical properties of the martian surface and atmosphere two 360-degree cylindrical scan cameras were mounted near one long side of the base from the center of this side extended the sampler arm with a collector head temperature sensor and magnet on the end a meteorology boom holding temperature wind direction and wind velocity sensors extended out and up from the top of one of the lander legs a seismometer magnet and camera test targets and magnifying mirror are mounted opposite the cameras near the high-gain antenna an interior environmentally controlled compartment held the biology experiment and the gas chromatograph mass spectrometer the x-ray fluorescence spectrometer was also mounted within the structure a pressure sensor was attached under the lander body the scientific payload had a total mass of approximately 91 kg 201 lb.nnbiological experimentseditnmain article viking biological experimentsnthe viking landers conducted biological experiments designed to detect life in the martian soil if it existed with experiments designed by three separate teams under the direction of chief scientist gerald soffen of nasa one experiment turned positive for the detection of metabolism current life but based on the results of the other two experiments that failed to reveal any organic molecules in the soil most scientists became convinced that the positive results were likely caused by non-biological chemical reactions from highly oxidizing soil conditions.nndust dunes and a large boulder taken by the viking 1 lander.trenches dug by the soil sampler of the viking 1 lander.nalthough there is consensus that the viking lander results demonstrated a lack of biosignatures in soils at the two landing sites the test results and their limitations are still under assessment the validity of the positive labeled release lr results hinged entirely on the absence of an oxidative agent in the martian soil but one was later discovered by the phoenix lander in the form of perchlorate salts it has been proposed that organic compounds could have been present in the soil analyzed by both viking 1 and viking 2 but remained unnoticed due to the presence of perchlorate as detected by phoenix in 2008 researchers found that perchlorate will destroy organics when heated and will produce chloromethane and dichloromethane the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both viking landers when they performed the same tests on mars.nthe question of microbial life on mars remains unresolved nonetheless on april 12 2012 an international team of scientists reported studies based on mathematical speculation through complexity analysis of the labeled release experiments of the 1976 viking mission that may suggest the detection of extant microbial life on mars."nncamera/imaging systemeditnthe leader of the imaging team was thomas mutch a geologist at brown university in providence rhode island the camera uses a movable mirror to illumate 12 photo diodes each of the 12 silicon diodes are designed to be sensitive to different frequences of light several diodes are placed to focus accurately at distances between six and 43 feet away from the lander.nthe cameras scanned at a rate of five vertical scan lines per second each composed of 512 pixels the 300 degree panorama images were composed of 9150 lines the cameras scan was slow enough that in a crew shot several members show up several times in the shot as they moved themselves as the camera scanned.nncontrol systemseditnthe viking landers used a guidance control and sequencing computer gcsc consisting of two honeywell hdc 402 24-bit computers with 18k of plated-wire memory while the viking orbiters used a command computer subsystem ccs using two custom-designed 18-bit serial processors.nnfinancial cost of the viking programeditnthe two orbiters cost us$217 million at the time which is about 1 billion usd in 2016 year-dollars the most expensive single part of the program was the landers life-detection unit which cost about 60 million then or 300 million usd in 2016 year-dollars development of the viking lander design cost us$357 million this was decades before nasas faster better cheaper approach and viking needed to pioneer unprecedented technologies under national pressure brought on by the cold war and the aftermath of the space race all under the prospect of possibly discovering extraterrestrial life for the first time the experiments had to adhere to a special 1971 directive that mandated that no single failure shall stop the return of more than one experimenta difficult and expensive task for a device with over 40,000 parts.nthe viking camera system cost us$27.3 million to develop or about 100 million in 2016 year-dollars when the imaging system design was completed it was difficult to find anyone who could manufacture it so advanced the program managers were later praised for fending off pressure to go with a simpler less advanced imaging system especially when the views rolled in the program did save some money by cutting out a third lander and reducing the number of experiments on the lander.noverall nasa says that us$1 billion in 1970s dollars was spent on the program which when inflation-adjusted to 2016 dollars is about 5 billion usd.nnmission endeditnthe craft eventually failed one by one as follows:nnnthe viking program ended on may 21 1983 to prevent an imminent impact with mars the orbit of viking 1 orbiter was raised on august 7 1980 before it was shut down 10 days later impact and potential contamination on the planets surface is possible from 2019 onwards its unknown if the viking 2 orbiters orbit was also raised to prevent an impact.nthe viking 1 lander was found to be about 6 kilometers from its planned landing site by the mars reconnaissance orbiter in december 2006.nnnviking lander locationseditnnn interactive imagemap of the global topography of
