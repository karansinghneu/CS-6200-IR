michelsonmorley experiment wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn figure 1 michelson and morleys interferometric setup mounted on a stone slab that floats in an annular trough of mercury.nthe michelsonmorley experiment was an attempt to detect the existence of aether a medium permeating space that was thought to be the carrier of light waves the experiment was performed between april and july 1887 by albert a michelson and edward w morley at what is now case western reserve university in cleveland ohio and published in november of the same year it compared the speed of light in perpendicular directions in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether aether wind the result was negative in that michelson and morley found no significant difference between the speed of light in the direction of movement through the presumed aether and the speed at right angles this result is generally considered to be the first strong evidence against the then-prevalent aether theory and initiated a line of research that eventually led to special relativity which rules out a stationary aether of this experiment einstein wrote if the michelson-morley experiment had not brought us into serious embarrassment no one would have regarded the relativity theory as a halfway redemption."nmichelsonmorley type experiments have been repeated many times with steadily increasing sensitivity these include experiments from 1902 to 1905 and a series of experiments in the 1920s more recent optical resonator experiments confirmed the absence of any aether wind at the 10 level together with the ivesstilwell and kennedythorndike experiments michelsonmorley type experiments form one of the fundamental tests of special relativity theory.nncontentsnnndetecting the aethereditnphysics theories of the late 19th century assumed that just as surface water waves must have a supporting substance i.e a medium to move across in this case water and audible sound requires a medium to transmit its wave motions such as air or water so light must also require a medium the luminiferous aether to transmit its wave motions because light can travel through a vacuum it was assumed that even a vacuum must be filled with aether because the speed of light is so great and because material bodies pass through the aether without obvious friction or drag it was assumed to have a highly unusual combination of properties designing experiments to test the properties of the aether was a high priority of 19th century physics.nearth orbits around the sun at a speed of around 30 km/s 18.64 mi/s or 108,000 km/h 67,000 mph the earth is in motion so two main possibilities were considered 1 the aether is stationary and only partially dragged by earth proposed by augustin-jean fresnel in 1818 or 2 the aether is completely dragged by earth and thus shares its motion at earths surface proposed by sir george stokes 1st baronet in 1844 in addition james clerk maxwell 1865 recognized the electromagnetic nature of light and developed what are now called maxwells equations but these equations were still interpreted as describing the motion of waves through an aether whose state of motion was unknown eventually fresnels idea of an almost stationary aether was preferred because it appeared to be confirmed by the fizeau experiment 1851 and the aberration of star light.nn figure 2 a depiction of the concept of the aether wind"naccording to the stationary and the partially-dragged aether hypotheses earth and the aether are in relative motion implying that a so-called aether wind fig 2 should exist although it would be possible in theory for the earths motion to match that of the aether at one moment in time it was not possible for the earth to remain at rest with respect to the aether at all times because of the variation in both the direction and the speed of the motion at any given point on the earths surface the magnitude and direction of the wind would vary with time of day and season by analyzing the return speed of light in different directions at various different times it was thought to be possible to measure the motion of the earth relative to the aether the expected relative difference in the measured speed of light was quite small given that the velocity of the earth in its orbit around the sun has a magnitude of about one hundredth of one percent of the speed of light.nduring the mid-19th century measurements of aether wind effects of first order i.e effects proportional to v/c v being earths velocity c the speed of light were thought to be possible but no direct measurement of the speed of light was possible with the accuracy required for instance the fizeaufoucault apparatus could measure the speed of light to perhaps 5 accuracy which was quite inadequate for measuring directly a first-order 0.01 change in the speed of light a number of physicists therefore attempted to make measurements of indirect first-order effects not of the speed of light itself but of variations in the speed of light see first order aether-drift experiments the hoek experiment for example was intended to detect interferometric fringe shifts due to speed differences of oppositely propagating light waves through water at rest the results of such experiments were all negative this could be explained by using fresnels dragging coefficient according to which the aether and thus light are partially dragged by moving matter partial aether-dragging would thwart attempts to measure any first order change in the speed of light as pointed out by maxwell 1878 only experimental arrangements capable of measuring second order effects would have any hope of detecting aether drift i.e effects proportional to v/c existing experimental setups however were not sensitive enough to measure effects of that size.nn1881 and 1887 experimentseditnmichelson experiment 1881editn michelsons 1881 interferometer although ultimately it proved incapable of distinguishing between differing theories of aether-dragging its construction provided important lessons for the design of michelson and morleys 1887 instrument.nnmichelson had a solution to the problem of how to construct a device sufficiently accurate to detect aether flow in 1877 while teaching at his alma mater the united states naval academy in annapolis michelson conducted his first known light speed experiments as a part of a classroom demonstration in 1881 he left active u.s naval service while in germany concluding his studies in that year michelson used a prototype experimental device to make several more measurements.nthe device he designed later known as a michelson interferometer sent yellow light from a sodium flame for alignment or white light for the actual observations through a half-silvered mirror that was used to split it into two beams traveling at right angles to one another after leaving the splitter the beams traveled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors they then recombined on the far side of the splitter in an eyepiece producing a pattern of constructive and destructive interference whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal vs the transverse arms if the earth is traveling through an aether medium a beam reflecting back and forth parallel to the flow of aether would take longer than a beam reflecting perpendicular to the aether because the time gained from traveling downwind is less than that lost traveling upwind michelson expected that the earths motion would produce a fringe shift equal to 0.04 fringesthat is of the separation between areas of the same intensity he did not observe the expected shift the greatest average deviation that he measured in the northwest direction was only 0.018 fringes most of his measurements were much less his conclusion was that fresnels hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected and thus he confirmed stokes hypothesis of complete aether dragging.nhowever alfred potier and later hendrik lorentz pointed out to michelson that he had made an error of calculation and that the expected fringe shift should have been only 0.02 fringes michelsons apparatus was subject to experimental errors far too large to say anything conclusive about the aether wind definitive measurement of the aether wind would require an experiment with greater accuracy and better controls than the original nevertheless the prototype was successful in demonstrating that the basic method was feasible.nnmichelsonmorley experiment 1887editnn figure 5 this figure illustrates the

began a collaboration with edward morley spending considerable time and money to confirm with higher accuracy fizeaus 1851 experiment on fresnels drag coefficient to improve on michelsons 1881 experiment and to establish the wavelength of light as a standard of length at this time michelson was professor of physics at the case school of applied science and morley was professor of chemistry at western reserve university wru which shared a campus with the case school on the eastern edge of cleveland michelson suffered a nervous breakdown in september 1885 from which he recovered by october 1885 morley ascribed this breakdown to the intense work of michelson during the preparation of the experiments in 1886 michelson and morley successfully confirmed fresnels drag coefficient this result was also considered as a confirmation of the stationary aether concept.nthis result strengthened their hope of finding the aether wind michelson and morley created an improved version of the michelson experiment with more than enough accuracy to detect this hypothetical effect the experiment was performed in several periods of concentrated observations between april and july 1887 in the basement of adelbert dormitory of wru later renamed pierce hall demolished in 1962.nas shown in fig 5 the light was repeatedly reflected back and forth along the arms of the interferometer increasing the path length to 11 m 36 ft at this length the drift would be about 0.4 fringes to make that easily detectable the apparatus was assembled in a closed room in the basement of the heavy stone dormitory eliminating most thermal and vibrational effects vibrations were further reduced by building the apparatus on top of a large block of sandstone fig 1 about a foot thick and five feet square which was then floated in a circular trough of mercury they estimated that effects of about 0.01 fringe would be detectable.nn figure 6 fringe pattern produced with a michelson interferometer using white light as configured here the central fringe is white rather than black.nmichelson and morley and other early experimentalists using interferometric techniques in an attempt to measure the properties of the luminiferous aether used partially monochromatic light only for initially setting up their equipment always switching to white light for the actual measurements the reason is that measurements were recorded visually purely monochromatic light would result in a uniform fringe pattern lacking modern means of environmental temperature control experimentalists struggled with continual fringe drift even when the interferometer was set up in a basement because the fringes would occasionally disappear due to vibrations caused by passing horse traffic distant thunderstorms and the like an observer could easily get lost when the fringes returned to visibility the advantages of white light which produced a distinctive colored fringe pattern far outweighed the difficulties of aligning the apparatus due to its low coherence length as dayton miller wrote white light fringes were chosen for the observations because they consist of a small group of fringes having a central sharply defined black fringe which forms a permanent zero reference mark for all readings use of partially monochromatic light yellow sodium light during initial alignment enabled the researchers to locate the position of equal path length more or less easily before switching to white light.nthe mercury trough allowed the device to turn with close to zero friction so that once having given the sandstone block a single push it would slowly rotate through the entire range of possible angles to the aether wind while measurements were continuously observed by looking through the eyepiece the hypothesis of aether drift implies that because one of the arms would inevitably turn into the direction of the wind at the same time that another arm was turning perpendicularly to the wind an effect should be noticeable even over a period of minutes.nthe expectation was that the effect would be graphable as a sine wave with two peaks and two troughs per rotation of the device this result could have been expected because during each full rotation each arm would be parallel to the wind twice facing into and away from the wind giving identical readings and perpendicular to the wind twice additionally due to the earths rotation the wind would be expected to show periodic changes in direction and magnitude during the course of a sidereal day.nbecause of the motion of the earth around the sun the measured data were also expected to show annual variations.nnmost famous failed experimenteditn figure 7 michelson and morleys results the upper solid line is the curve for their observations at noon and the lower solid line is that for their evening observations note that the theoretical curves and the observed curves are not plotted at the same scale the dotted curves in fact represent only one-eighth of the theoretical displacements.nafter all this thought and preparation the experiment became what has been called the most famous failed experiment in history instead of providing insight into the properties of the aether michelson and morleys article in the american journal of science reported the measurement to be as small as one-fortieth of the expected displacement fig 7 but since the displacement is proportional to the square of the velocity they concluded that the measured velocity was probably less than one-sixth of the expected velocity of the earths motion in orbit and certainly less than one-fourth although this small velocity was measured it was considered far too small to be used as evidence of speed relative to the aether and it was understood to be within the range of an experimental error that would allow the speed to actually be zero for instance michelson wrote about the decidedly negative result in a letter to lord rayleigh in august 1887:nnthe experiments on the relative motion of the earth and ether have been completed and the result decidedly negative the expected deviation of the interference fringes from the zero should have been 0.40 of a fringe the maximum displacement was 0.02 and the average much less than 0.01 and then not in the right place as displacement is proportional to squares of the relative velocities it follows that if the ether does slip past the relative velocity is less than one sixth of the earths velocity albert abraham michelson 1887nnfrom the standpoint of the then current aether models the experimental results were conflicting the fizeau experiment and its 1886 repetition by michelson and morley apparently confirmed the stationary aether with partial aether dragging and refuted complete aether dragging on the other hand the much more precise michelsonmorley experiment 1887 apparently confirmed complete aether dragging and refuted the stationary aether in addition the michelsonmorley null result was further substantiated by the null results of other second-order experiments of different kind namely the troutonnoble experiment 1903 and the experiments of rayleigh and brace 19021904 these problems and their solution led to the development of the lorentz transformation and special relativity.nafter the failed experiment michelson and morley ceased their aether drift measurements and started to use their newly developed technique to establish the wavelength of light as a standard of length.nnlight path analysis and consequenceseditnobserver resting in the aethereditnfigure 4 expected differential phase shift between light traveling the longitudinal versus the transverse arms of the michelsonmorley apparatusnthe beam travel time in the longitudinal direction can be derived as follows light is sent from the source and propagates with the speed of light in the aether it passes through the half-silvered mirror at the origin at the reflecting mirror is at that moment at distance the length of the interferometer arm and is moving with velocity the beam hits the mirror at time and thus travels the distance at this time the mirror has traveled the distance thus and consequently the travel time the same consideration applies to the backward journey with the sign of reversed resulting in and the total travel time is:nnnmichelson obtained this expression correctly in 1881 however in transverse direction he obtained the incorrect expressionnnnbecause he overlooked that the aether wind also affects the transverse beam travel time this was corrected by alfred potier 1882 and lorentz 1886 the derivation in the transverse direction can be given as follows analogous to the derivation of time dilation using a light clock the beam is propagating at the speed of light and hits the mirror at time traveling the distance at the same time the mirror has traveled the distance in the x direction so in order to hit the mirror the travel path of the beam is in the y direction assuming equal-length arms and in the x direction this inclined travel path follows from the transformation from the interferometer rest frame to the aether rest frame therefore the pythagorean theorem gives the actual beam travel distance of thus and consequently the travel time which is the same for the backward journey the total travel time is:nnnthe time difference between t and t before rotation is given bynnnby multiplying with c the corresponding length difference before rotation isnnnand after rotationnnndividing by the wavelength the fringe shift n is found:nnnsince l 11 meters and 500 nanometers the expected fringe shift was n 0.44 so the result would be a delay in one of the light beams that could be detected when the beams were recombined through interference any slight change in the spent time would then be observed as a shift in the positions of the interference fringes the negative result led michelson to the conclusion that there is no measurable aether drift.nnobserver comoving with the interferometereditnif the same situation is described from the view of an observer co-moving with the interferometer then the effect of aether wind is similar to the effect experienced by a swimmer who tries to move with velocity against a river flowing with velocity nin the longitudinal direction the swimmer first moves upstream so his velocity is diminished due to the river flow to on his way back moving downstream his velocity is increased to this gives the beam travel times and as mentioned above.nin the transverse direction the swimmer has to compensate for the river flow by moving at a certain angle against the flow direction in order to sustain his exact transverse direction of motion and to reach the other side of the river at the correct location this diminishes his speed to and gives the beam travel time as mentioned above.nnmirror reflectioneditnthe classical analysis predicted a relative phase shift between the longitudinal and transverse beams which in michelson and morleys apparatus should have been readily measurable what is not often appreciated since there was no means of measuring it is that motion through the hypothetical aether should also have caused the two beams to diverge as they emerged from the interferometer by about 10 radians.nfor an apparatus in motion the classical analysis requires that the beam-splitting mirror be slightly offset from an exact 45 if the longitudinal and transverse beams are to emerge from the apparatus exactly superimposed in the relativistic analysis lorentz-contraction of the beam splitter in the direction of motion causes it to become more perpendicular by precisely the amount necessary to compensate for the angle discrepancy of the two beams.nnlength contraction and lorentz transformationeditnfurther information history of special relativity and history of lorentz transformationsna first step to explaining the michelson and morley experiments null result was found in the fitzgeraldlorentz contraction hypothesis now simply called length contraction or lorentz contraction first proposed by george fitzgerald 1889 and hendrik lorentz 1892 according to this law all objects physically contract by along the line of motion originally thought to be relative to the aether being the lorentz factor this hypothesis was partly motivated by oliver heavisides discovery in 1888 that electrostatic fields are contracting in the line of motion but since there was no reason at that time to assume that binding forces in matter are of electric origin length contraction of matter in motion with respect to the aether was considered an ad hoc hypothesis.nif length contraction of is inserted into the above formula for then the light propagation time in the longitudinal direction becomes equal to that in the transverse direction:nnnhowever length contraction is only a special case of the more general relation according to which the transverse length is larger than the longitudinal length by the ratio this can be achieved in many ways if is the moving longitudinal length and the moving transverse length being the rest lengths then it is given:nnn can be arbitrarily chosen so there are infinitely many combinations to explain the michelsonmorley null result for instance if the relativistic value of length contraction of occurs but if then no length contraction but an elongation of occurs this hypothesis was later extended by joseph larmor 1897 lorentz 1904 and henri poincar 1905 who developed the complete lorentz transformation including time dilation in order to explain the troutonnoble experiment the experiments of rayleigh and brace and kaufmanns experiments it has the formnnnit remained to define the value of which was shown by lorentz 1904 to be unity in general poincar 1905 demonstrated that only allows this transformation to form a group so it is the only choice compatible with the principle of relativity i.e making the stationary aether undetectable given this length contraction and time dilation obtain their exact relativistic values.nnspecial relativityeditnalbert einstein formulated the theory of special relativity by 1905 deriving the lorentz transformation and thus length contraction and time dilation from the relativity postulate and the constancy of the speed of light thus removing the ad hoc character from the contraction hypothesis einstein emphasized the kinematic foundation of the theory and the modification of the notion of space and time with the stationary aether no longer playing any role in his theory he also pointed out the group character of the transformation einstein was motivated by maxwells theory of electromagnetism in the form as it was given by lorentz in 1895 and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous aether.nthis allows a more elegant and intuitive explanation of the michelson-morley null result in a comoving frame the null result is self-evident since the apparatus can be considered as at rest in accordance with the relativity principle thus the beam travel times are the same in a frame relative to which the apparatus is moving the same reasoning applies as described above in length contraction and lorentz transformation except the word aether has to be replaced by non-comoving inertial frame einstein wrote in 1916:nnalthough the estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small michelson and morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this difference should have been clearly detectable but the experiment gave a negative result a fact very perplexing to physicists lorentz and fitzgerald rescued the theory from this difficulty by assuming that the motion of the body relative to the ther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion the amount of contraction being just sufficient to compensate for the difference in time mentioned above comparison with the discussion in section 11 shows that also from the standpoint of the theory of relativity this solution of the difficulty was the right one but on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory according to this theory there is no such thing as a specially favoured unique co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the ther-idea and hence there can be no ther-drift nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it here the contraction of moving bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory without the introduction of particular hypotheses and as the prime factor involved in this contraction we find not the motion in itself to which we cannot attach any meaning but the motion with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case in point thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth the mirror system of michelson and morley is not shortened but it is shortened for a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively to the sun albert einstein 1916nnthe extent to which the null result of the michelsonmorley experiment influenced einstein is disputed alluding to some statements of einstein many historians argue that it played no significant role in his path to special relativity while other statements of einstein probably suggest that he was influenced by it in any case the null result of the michelsonmorley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.nit was later shown by howard percy robertson 1949 and others see robertsonmansourisexl test theory that it is possible to derive the lorentz transformation entirely from the combination of three experiments first the michelsonmorley experiment showed that the speed of light is independent of the orientation of the apparatus establishing the relationship between longitudinal and transverse lengths then in 1932 roy kennedy and edward thorndike modified the michelsonmorley experiment by making the path lengths of the split beam unequal with one arm being very short the kennedythorndike experiment took place for many months as the earth moved around the sun their negative result showed that the speed of light is independent of the velocity of the apparatus in different inertial frames in addition it established that besides length changes corresponding time changes must also occur i.e it established the relationship between longitudinal lengths and time changes so both experiments do not provide the individual values of these quantities this uncertainty corresponds to the undefined factor as described above it was clear due to theoretical reasons the group character of the lorentz transformation as required by the relativity principle that the individual values of length contraction and time dilation must assume their exact relativistic form but a direct measurement of one of these quantities was still desirable to confirm the theoretical results this was achieved by the ivesstilwell experiment 1938 measuring in accordance with time dilation combining this value for with the kennedythorndike null result shows that must assume the value of relativistic length contraction combining with the michelsonmorley null result shows that must be zero therefore the lorentz transformation with is an unavoidable consequence of the combination of these three experiments.nspecial relativity is generally considered the solution to all negative aether drift or isotropy of the speed of light measurements including the michelsonmorley null result many high precision measurements have been conducted as tests of special relativity and modern searches for lorentz violation in the photon electron nucleon or neutrino sector all of them confirming relativity.nnincorrect alternativeseditnas mentioned above michelson initially believed that his experiment would confirm stokes theory according to which the aether was fully dragged in the vicinity of the earth see aether drag hypothesis however complete aether drag contradicts the observed aberration of light and was contradicted by other experiments as well in addition lorentz showed in 1886 that stokess attempt to explain aberration is contradictory.nfurthermore the assumption that the aether is not carried in the vicinity but only within matter was very problematic as shown by the hammar experiment 1935 hammar directed one leg of his interferometer through a heavy metal pipe plugged with lead if aether were dragged by mass it was theorized that the mass of the sealed metal pipe would have been enough to cause a visible effect once again no effect was seen so aether-drag theories are considered to be disproven.nwalther ritzs emission theory or ballistic theory was also consistent with the results of the experiment not requiring aether the theory postulates that light has always the same velocity in respect to the source however de sitter noted that emitter theory predicted several optical effects that were not seen in observations of binary stars in which the light from the two stars could be measured in a spectrometer if emission theory were correct the light from the stars should experience unusual fringe shifting due to the velocity of the stars being added to the speed of the light but no such effect could be seen it was later shown by j g fox that the original de sitter experiments were flawed due to extinction but in 1977 brecher observed x-rays from binary star systems with similar null results also terrestrial tests using particle accelerators have been made that were inconsistent with source dependence of the speed of light in addition emission theory might fail the ivesstilwell experiment but fox questioned that as well.nnsubsequent experimentseditn figure 8 simulation of the kennedy/illingworth refinement of the michelsonmorley experiment a michelsonmorley interference pattern in monochromatic mercury light with a dark fringe precisely centered on the screen b the fringes have been shifted to the left by 1/100 of the fringe spacing it is extremely difficult to see any difference between this figure and the one above c a small step in one mirror causes two views of the same fringes to be spaced 1/20 of the fringe spacing to the left and to the right of the step d a telescope has been set to view only the central dark band around the mirror step note the symmetrical brightening about the center line e the two sets of fringes have been shifted to the left by 1/100 of the fringe spacing an abrupt discontinuity in luminosity is visible across the step.nalthough michelson and morley went on to different experiments after their first publication in 1887 both remained active in the field other versions of the experiment were carried out with increasing sophistication morley was not convinced of his own results and went on to conduct additional experiments with dayton miller from 1902 to 1904 again the result was negative within the margins of error.nmiller worked on increasingly larger interferometers culminating in one with a 32-meter 105 ft effective arm length that he tried at various sites including on top of a mountain at the mount wilson observatory to avoid the possibility of the aether wind being blocked by solid walls his mountaintop observations used a special shed with thin walls mainly of canvas from noisy irregular data he consistently extracted a small positive signal that varied with each rotation of the device with the sidereal day and on a yearly basis his measurements in the 1920s amounted to approximately 10 km/s 6.2 mi/s instead of the nearly 30 km/s 18.6 mi/s expected from the earths orbital motion alone he remained convinced this was due to partial entrainment or aether dragging though he did not attempt a detailed explanation he ignored critiques demonstrating the inconsistency of his results and the refutation by the hammar experiment millers findings were considered important at the time and were discussed by michelson lorentz and others at a meeting reported in 1928 there was general agreement that more experimentation was needed to check millers results miller later built a non-magnetic device to eliminate magnetostriction while michelson built one of non-expanding invar to eliminate any remaining thermal effects other experimenters from around the world increased accuracy eliminated possible side effects or both so far no one has been able to replicate millers results and modern experimental accuracies have ruled them out roberts 2006 has pointed out that the primitive data reduction techniques used by miller and other early experimenters including michelson and morley were capable of creating apparent periodic signals even when none existed in the actual data after reanalyzing millers original data using modern techniques of quantitative error analysis roberts found millers apparent signals to be statistically insignificant.nusing a special optical arrangement involving a 1/20 wave step in one mirror roy j kennedy 1926 and k.k illingworth 1927 fig 8 converted the task of detecting fringe shifts from the relatively insensitive one of estimating their lateral displacements to the considerably more sensitive task of adjusting the light intensity on both sides of a sharp boundary for equal luminance if they observed unequal illumination on either side of the step such as in fig 8e they would add or remove calibrated weights from the interferometer until both sides of the step were once again evenly illuminated as in fig 8d the number of weights added or removed provided a measure of the fringe shift different observers could detect changes as little as 1/300 to 1/1500 of a fringe kennedy also carried out an experiment at mount wilson finding only about 1/10 the drift measured by miller and no seasonal effects.nin 1930 georg joos conducted an experiment using an automated interferometer with 21-meter-long 69 ft arms forged from pressed quartz having very low thermal coefficient of expansion that took continuous photographic strip recordings of the fringes through dozens of revolutions of the apparatus displacements of 1/1000 of a fringe could be measured on the photographic plates no periodic fringe displacements were found placing an upper limit to the aether wind of 1.5 km/s 0.93 mi/s.nin the table below the expected values are related to the relative speed between earth and sun of 30 km/s 18.6 mi/s with respect to the speed of the solar system around the galactic center of about 220 km/s 140 mi/s or the speed of the solar system relative to the cmb rest frame of about 368 km/s 229 mi/s the null results of those experiments are even more obvious.nnnrecent experimentseditnoptical testseditnoptical tests of the isotropy of the speed of light became commonplace new technologies including the use of lasers and masers have significantly improved measurement precision in the following table only essen 1955 jaseja 1964 and shamir/fox 1969 are experiments of michelsonmorley type i.e comparing two perpendicular beams the other optical experiments employed different methods.nnn figure 9 michelsonmorley experiment with cryogenic optical resonators of a form such as was used by mller et al 2003.nrecent optical resonator experimentseditnover the last several years there has been a resurgence in interest in performing precise michelsonmorley type experiments using lasers masers cryogenic optical resonators etc this is in large part due to predictions of quantum gravity that suggest that special relativity may be violated at scales accessible to experimental study the first of these highly accurate experiments was conducted by brillet hall 1979 in which they analyzed a laser frequency stabilized to a resonance of a rotating optical fabryprot cavity they set a limit on the anisotropy of the speed of light resulting from the earths motions of c/c 10 where c is the difference between the speed of light in the x and y-directions.nas of 2009 optical and microwave resonator experiments have improved this limit to c/c 10 in some of them the devices were rotated or remained stationary and some were combined with the kennedythorndike experiment in particular earths direction and velocity ca 368 km/s 229 mi/s relative to the cmb rest frame are ordinarily used as references in these searches for anisotropies.nnnnother tests of lorentz invarianceeditnfurther
