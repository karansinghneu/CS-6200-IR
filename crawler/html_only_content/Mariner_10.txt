mariner 10 wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnmariner 10 was an american robotic space probe launched by nasa on november 3 1973 to fly by the planets mercury and venus.nmariner 10 was launched approximately two years after mariner 9 and was the last spacecraft in the mariner program mariner 11 and 12 were allocated to the voyager program and redesignated voyager 1 and voyager 2.nthe mission objectives were to measure mercurys environment atmosphere surface and body characteristics and to make similar investigations of venus secondary objectives were to perform experiments in the interplanetary medium and to obtain experience with a dual-planet gravity assist mission mariner 10s science team was led by bruce c murray at the jet propulsion laboratory.nncontentsnnndesign and trajectoryeditn artists impression of the mariner 10 mission the first mission to perform a gravity assist it used a flyby of the planet venus in order to decrease its perihelion this would allow the spacecraft to meet mercury on three occasions in 1974 and 1975.nmariner 10 was the first spacecraft to make use of an interplanetary gravitational slingshot maneuver using venus to bend its flight path and bring its perihelion down to the level of mercurys orbit this maneuver inspired by the orbital mechanics calculations of the italian scientist giuseppe colombo put the spacecraft into an orbit that repeatedly brought it back to mercury mariner 10 used the solar radiation pressure on its solar panels and its high-gain antenna as a means of attitude control during flight the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.nthe components on mariner 10 can be categorized into four groups based on their common function the solar panels power subsystem attitude control subsystem and computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight the navigational system including the hydrazine rocket would keep mariner 10 on track to venus and mercury several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets finally the antennas would transmit this data to the deep space network back on earth as well as receive commands from mission control mariner 10s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism the hub stored the spacecrafts internal electronics the mariner 10 spacecraft was manufactured by boeing nasa set a strict limit of 98 million for mariner 10s total cost which marked the first time the agency subjected a mission to an inflexible budget constraint no overruns would be tolerated so mission planners carefully considered cost efficiency when designing the spacecrafts instruments cost control was primarily accomplished by executing contract work closer to the launch date than was recommended by normal mission schedules as reducing the length of available work time increased cost efficiency despite the rushed schedule very few deadlines were missed the mission ended up about 1 million under budget.nattitude control is needed to keep a spacecrafts instruments and antennas aimed in the correct direction during course maneuvers a spacecraft may need to rotate so that its rocket faces the proper direction before being fired mariner 10 determined its attitude using two optical sensors one pointed at the sun and the other at a bright star usually canopus additionally the probes three gyroscopes provided a second option for calculating the attitude nitrogen gas thrusters were used to adjust mariner 10s orientation along three axes the spacecrafts electronics were intricate and complex it contained over 32,000 pieces of circuitry of which resistors capacitors diodes microcircuits and transistors were the most common devices commands for the instruments could be stored on mariner 10s computer but were limited to 512 words the rest had to be broadcast by the mission sequence working group from earth supplying the spacecraft components with power required modifying the electrical output of the solar panels the power subsystem used two redundant sets of circuitry each containing a booster regulator and an inverter to convert the panels dc output to ac and alter the voltage to the necessary level the subsystem could store up to 20 ampere hours of electricity on a 39 volt nickel-cadmium battery.nthe flyby past mercury posed major technical challenges for scientists to overcome due to mercurys proximity to the sun mariner 10 would have to endure 4.5 times more solar radiation than when it departed earthcompared to previous mariner missions spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body after evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material mission planners chose beta cloth a combination of aluminized kapton and glass-fiber sheets treated with teflon however solar shielding was unfeasible for some of mariner 10s other components mariner 10s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 c covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity the solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed engineers considered folding the panels toward each other making a v-shape with the main body but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft the alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecrafts nitrogen jet thrusters which could now be placed on the panel tips the panels could be rotated a maximum of 76 degrees additionally mariner 10s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the sun to function properly but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution instead a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.naccurately performing the gravity assist at venus posed another hurdle if mariner 10 was to maintain a course to mercury its trajectory could deviate no more than 200 kilometres 120 mi from a critical point in the vicinity of venus to ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made mission planners tripled the amount of hydrazine fuel mariner 10 would carry and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous mariner mission had held these upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third mercury flybys.nthe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard a sister spacecraft it was common for probes to be launched in pairs with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other the budget constraint ruled this option out even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time in the event that mariner 10 failed nasa would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixedthis would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on november 3 and the last possible launch date of november 21 the unused backup was sent to the smithsonian museumnninstrumentseditn an illustration showing mariner 10s instrumentsnmariner 10 conducted seven experiments at venus and mercury six of these experiments had a dedicated scientific instrument to collect data the experiments and instruments were designed by research laboratories and educational institutions from across the united states out of forty-six submissions jpl selected seven experiments on the basis of maximizing science return without exceeding cost guidelines together the seven scientific experiments cost 12.6 million dollars about one-eighth of the total mission budget.nntelevision photographyeditnthe imaging system the television photography experiment consisted of two 15 cm 5.9 cassegrain telescopes feeding vidicon tubes the main telescope could be bypassed to a smaller wide angle optic but using the same tube it had an 8-position filter wheel with one position occupied by a mirror for the wide-angle bypass.nthe entire imaging system was imperiled when electric heaters attached to the cameras failed to turn on immediately after launch to avoid the suns damaging heat the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the sun consequently the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged jpl engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of 40 c therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight test photos of the earth and moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected the mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on january 17 two months after launch later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on this allowed the vidicons to be turned off as needed.nof the six main scientific instruments the 43.6 kilograms 96 lb cameras were by far the most massive device requiring 67 watts of electricity the cameras consumed more power than the other five instruments combined the system returned about 7000 photographs of mercury and venus during mariner 10s flybys.nninfrared radiometereditnthe infrared radiometer detected infrared radiation given off by mercurys surface and venus atmosphere from which the temperature could be calculated how quickly the surface lost heat as it rotated into the planets dark side revealed aspects about the surfaces composition such as whether it was made out of rocks or out of finer particles the infrared radiometer contained a pair of cassegrain telescopes fixed at an angle of 120 degrees to each other and a pair of detectors made from antimony-bismuth thermopiles the instrument was designed to measure temperatures as cold as 193 c and as hot as 427 c stillman c chase jr of the santa barbara research center headed the infrared radiometer experiment.nnultraviolet spectrometerseditntwo ultraviolet spectrometers were involved in this experiment one to measure uv absorption the other to sense uv emissions the occultation spectrometer scanned mercurys edge as it passed in front of the sun and detected whether solar ultraviolet radiation was absorbed at certain wavelengths which would indicate the presence of gas particles and therefore an atmosphere the airglow spectrometer detected extreme ultraviolet radiation emanating from atoms of gaseous hydrogen helium carbon oxygen neon and argon unlike the occultation spectrometer it did not require backlighting from the sun and could move along with the rotatable scan platform on the spacecraft the experiments most important goal was to ascertain whether mercury had an atmosphere but would also gather data at earth and venus and study the interstellar background radiation.nnplasma detectorseditnthe plasma experiments goal was to study the ionized gases plasma of the solar wind the temperature and density of its electrons and how the planets affected the velocity of the plasma stream the experiment contained two components facing in opposite directions the scanning electrostatic analyzer was aimed toward the sun and could detect positive ions and electrons which were separated by a set of three concentric hemispherical plates the scanning electron spectrometer was aimed away from the sun and detected only electrons using just one hemispherical plate the instruments could be rotated about 60 degrees to either side by gathering data on the solar winds movement around mercury the plasma experiment could be used to verify the magnetometers observations of mercurys magnetic field using the plasma detectors mariner 10 gathered the first in situ solar wind data from inside venus orbit.nshortly after launch scientists found that the scanning electrostatic analyzer had failed because a door shielding the analyzer did not open an unsuccessful attempt was made to forcibly unfasten the door with the first course correction maneuver the experiment operators had planned to observe the directions taken by positive ions prior to the ions collision with the analyzer but this data was lost the experiment was still able to collect some data using the properly functioning scanning electron spectrometer.nncharged particle telescopeseditnthe goal of the charged particles experiment was to observe how the heliosphere interacted with cosmic radiation in connection with the plasma detectors and magnetometers this experiment had the potential to provide additional evidence of a magnetic field around mercury by showing whether such a field had captured charged particles two telescopes were used to collect highly energetic electrons and atomic nuclei specifically oxygen nuclei or less massive these particles then passed through a set of detectors and were counted.nnmagnetometerseditntwo fluxgate magnetometers were entrusted with discerning whether mercury produced a magnetic field and studying the interplanetary magnetic field between flybys in designing this experiment scientists had to account for interference from the magnetic field generated by mariner 10s many electronic parts for this reason the magnetometers had to be situated on a long boom one closer to the octagonal hub the other one further away data from the two magnetometers would be cross-referenced to filter out the spacecrafts own magnetic field drastically weakening the probes magnetic field would have increased costs.nncelestial mechanics and radio science experimenteditnthis experiment investigated the mass and gravitational characteristics of mercury it was of particular interest because of the planets closeness to the sun large orbital eccentricity and unusual spin-orbit resonance.nas the spacecraft passed behind mercury on the first encounter there was an opportunity to probe the atmosphere and to measure the radius of the planet by observing phase changes in the s-band radio signal measurements of the atmosphere could be made the atmosphere was assessed as having a density of about 701610000000000000010 molecules per cm.nndeparting the earthmoon systemeditn mariner 10 imaged the earth and moon shortly after launchnboeing finished building the spacecraft at the end of june 1973 and mariner 10 was delivered from seattle to jpls headquarters in california where jpl comprehensively tested the integrity of the spacecraft and its instruments after the tests were finished the probe was transported to the eastern test range in florida the launch site technicians filled a tank on the spacecraft with 29 kilograms 64 lb of hydrazine fuel so that the probe could make course corrections and attached squibs whose detonation would signal mariner 10 to exit the launch rocket and deploy its instruments the planned gravity assist at venus made it feasible to use an atlas-centaur rocket instead of a more powerful but more expensive titan iiic the probe and the atlas-centaur were attached together ten days prior to liftoff launch posed one of the largest risks of failure for the mariner 10 missionmariner 1 mariner 3 and mariner 8 all failed minutes after lift-off due to either engineering failures or atlas rocket malfunctions the mission had a launch period of about a month in length from october 16 1973 to november 21 nasa chose november 3 as the launch date because it would optimize imaging conditions when the spacecraft arrived at mercury.nn launch of mariner 10non november 3 at 12:45 am eastern time the atlas-centaur carrying mariner 10 lifted off from pad slc-36b the atlas stage burned for around four minutes after which it was jettisoned and the centaur stage took over for an additional five minutes propelling mariner 10 to a parking orbit the temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around earth this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the centaur engines which set mariner 10 on a path towards venus the probe then separated from the rocket subsequently the centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of future collision never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch and even with mariner 10 scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.nduring its first week of flight the mariner 10 camera system was tested by taking five photographic mosaics of the earth and six of the moon it also obtained photographs of the north polar region of the moon where prior coverage was poor these photographs provided a basis for cartographers to update lunar maps and improve the lunar control net.nncruise to venuseditn trajectory of mariner 10 spacecraft since launch on november 3 1973 to first fly-by of mercury on march 29 1974nfar from being an uneventful cruise mariner 10s three-month journey to venus was fraught with technical malfunctions which kept mission control on edge donna shirley recounted her teams frustration it seemed as if we were always just patching mariner 10 together long enough to get it on to the next phase and next crisis a trajectory correction maneuver was made on november 13 1973 immediately afterwards the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star canopus an automated safety protocol recovered canopus but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission the on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise on january 8 a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem as a result the main booster regulator and inverter failed leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator mission planners feared that the same problem could recur in the redundant system and cripple the spacecraft.nin january 1974 mariner 10 made ultraviolet observations of comet kohoutek another mid-course correction was made on january 21 1974.nnvenus flybyeditnthe spacecraft passed venus on february 5 1974 the closest approach being 5,768 km at 17:01 ut it was the twelfth spacecraft to reach venus and the eighth to return data from the planet as well as the first mission to succeed in broadcasting images of venus back to earth mariner 10 built upon observations made by mariner 5 six years earlier importantly mariner 10 had a camera whereas the prior mission lacked one as mariner 10 veered around venus from the planets night side to daylight the cameras snapped the probes first image of venus showing an illuminated arc of clouds over the north pole emerging from darkness engineers initially feared that the star-tracker could mistake the much brighter venus for canopus repeating the mishaps with flaking paint however the star-tracker did not malfunction earth occultation occurred between 17:07 ut and 17:11 ut during which the spacecraft transmitted x-band radio waves through venus atmosphere gathering data on cloud structure and temperature although venuss cloud cover is nearly featureless in visible light it was discovered that extensive cloud detail could be seen through mariners ultraviolet camera filters earth-based ultra-violet observation had shown some indistinct blotching even before mariner 10 but the detail seen by mariner was a surprise to most researchers the probe continued photographing venus until february 13 among the encounters 4,165 acquired photographs one resulting series of images captured a thick and distinctly patterned atmosphere making a full revolution every four days just as terrestrial observations had suggested.nthe mission revealed the composition and meteorological nature of venus atmosphere data from the radio science experiment measured the extent to which radio waves passing through the atmosphere were refracted which was used to calculate the density pressure and temperature of the atmosphere at any given altitude overall atmospheric temperature is higher closer to the planets surface but mariner 10 found four altitudes where the pattern was reversed which could signify the presence of a layer of clouds the inversions occurred at the 56 61 63 and 81 km levels confirming previous observations made by the mariner 5 encounter the ultraviolet spectrometers identified the chemical substances that comprise venus atmosphere the elevated concentration of atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere showed that the atmosphere is stratified into upper and lower layers that do not mix with each other photographs of the upper and lower cloud layers corroborated this hypothesis mariner 10s ultraviolet photographs were an invaluable information source for studying the churning clouds of venus atmosphere the mission researchers believed the cloud features they photographed were located in the stratosphere and upper troposphere created by condensation they also concluded that the contrast between darker and lighter features was due to differences in the clouds absorptivity of uv light the subsolar region was of particular interest as the sun is straight overhead it imparts more solar energy to this area than other part of the planet compared to the rest of the planets atmosphere the subsolar region was highly active and irregular cells of air lifted by convection each up to 500 km wide were observed forming and dissipating within the span of a few hours some had polygonal outlines.nthe gravity assist was also a success coming well within the acceptable margin for error in the four hours between 16:00 ut and 20:00 ut on february 5 mariner 10s heliocentric velocity dropped from 82,785 mph to 72,215 mph this changed the shape of the spacecrafts elliptical orbit around the sun so that the perihelion now coincided with the orbit of mercury.nnnfirst mercury flybyeditnthe spacecraft flew past mercury three times the first mercury encounter took place at 20:47 ut on march 29 1974 at a range of 703 kilometers 437 mi passing on the shadow side.nnnsecond mercury flybyeditnafter looping once around the sun while mercury completed two orbits mariner 10 flew by mercury again on september 21 1974 at a more distant range of 48,069 km 29,869 mi below the southern hemisphere.nnnthird mercury flybyeditnafter losing roll control in october 1974 a third and final encounter the closest to mercury took place on march 16 1975 at a range of 327 km 203 mi passing almost over the north pole.nnnend of missioneditnwith its maneuvering gas just about exhausted mariner 10 started another orbit of the sun engineering tests were continued until march 24 1975 when final depletion of the nitrogen supply was signaled by the onset of an un-programmed pitch turn commands were sent immediately to the spacecraft to turn off its transmitter and radio signals to earth ceased.nmariner 10 is presumably still orbiting the sun although its electronics have probably been damaged by the suns radiation mariner 10 has not been spotted or tracked from earth since it stopped transmitting the only way it would not be orbiting would be if it had been hit by an asteroid or gravitationally perturbed by a close encounter with a large body.nndiscoverieseditnduring its flyby of venus mariner 10 discovered evidence of rotating clouds and a very weak magnetic field using a near-ultraviolet filter it photographed venuss chevron clouds and performed other atmospheric studies.nthe spacecraft flew past mercury three times owing to the geometry of its orbit its orbital period was almost exactly twice mercurys the same side of mercury was sunlit each time so it was only able to map 4045 of mercurys surface taking over 2,800 photos it revealed a more or less moon-like surface it thus contributed enormously to our understanding of mercury whose surface had not been successfully resolved through telescopic observation the regions mapped included most or all of the shakespeare beethoven kuiper michelangelo tolstoj and discovery quadrangles half of bach and victoria quadrangles and small portions of solitudo persephones later neruda liguria later raditladi and borealis quadrangles.nmariner 10 also discovered that mercury has a tenuous atmosphere consisting primarily of helium as well as a magnetic field and a large iron-rich core.nits radiometer readings suggested that mercury has a night time temperature of 183 c 297 f and maximum daytime temperatures of 187 c 369 f.nplanning for messenger a spacecraft that surveyed mercury until 2015 relied extensively on data and information collected by mariner 10.nn mariner 10 space probe issue of 1975nmariner 10 commemorationeditnin 1975 the us post office issued a commemorative stamp featuring the mariner 10 space probe the 10-cent mariner 10 commemorative stamp was issued on april 4 1975 at pasadena california.nsince the backup spacecraft was never launched it was put on exhibition at the
