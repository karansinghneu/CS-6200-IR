mean free path wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnin physics the mean free path is the average distance travelled by a moving particle such as an atom a molecule a photon between successive impacts collisions which modify its direction or energy or other particle properties.nthe following table lists some typical values for air at different pressures at room temperature.nnncontentsnnnradiographyeditn mean free path for photons in energy range from 1 kev to 20 mev for elements with z 1 to 100 the discontinuities are due to low density of gas elements six bands correspond to neighborhoods of six noble gases also shown are locations of absorption edges.nin gamma-ray radiography the mean free path of a pencil beam of mono-energetic photons is the average distance a photon travels between collisions with atoms of the target material it depends on the material and the energy of the photons:nnnwhere is the linear attenuation coefficient is the mass attenuation coefficient and is the density of the material the mass attenuation coefficient can be looked up or calculated for any material and energy combination using the national institute of standards and technology nist databasesnin x-ray radiography the calculation of the mean free path is more complicated because photons are not mono-energetic but have some distribution of energies called a spectrum as photons move through the target material they are attenuated with probabilities depending on their energy as a result their distribution changes in process called spectrum hardening because of spectrum hardening the mean free path of the x-ray spectrum changes with distance.nsometimes one measures the thickness of a material in the number of mean free paths material with the thickness of one mean free path will attenuate 37 1/e of photons this concept is closely related to half-value layer hvl a material with a thickness of one hvl will attenuate 50 of photons a standard x-ray image is a transmission image an image with negative logarithm of its intensities is sometimes called a number of mean free paths image.nnelectronicseditnsee also ballistic conductionnelectrical mobility a value directly related to electrical conductivity is:nnnwhere e is the charge is the mean free time m is the effective mass d is the mean free path and v is the fermi velocity of the charge carrier the fermi velocity can easily be derived from the fermi energy via the non-relativistic kinetic energy equation in thin films however the film thickness can be smaller than the predicted mean free path making surface scattering much more noticeable effectively increasing the resistivity.nelectron mobility through a medium with dimensions smaller than the mean free path of electrons occurs through ballistic conduction or ballistic transport in such scenarios electrons alter their motion only in collisions with conductor walls.nnopticseditnif one takes a suspension of non-light-absorbing particles of diameter d with a volume fraction the mean free path of the photons is:nnnwhere q is the scattering efficiency factor q can be evaluated numerically for spherical particles using mie theory.nnacousticseditnin an otherwise empty cavity the mean free path of a single particle bouncing off the walls is:nnnwhere v is volume of the cavity s is total inside surface area of cavity and f a constant related to the shape of the cavity for most simple cavity shapes f is approximately 4.nthis relation is used in the derivation of the sabine equation in acoustics using a geometrical approximation of sound propagation.nnderivationeditnn slab of targetnimagine a beam of particles being shot through a target and consider an infinitesimally thin slab of the target see the figure the atoms or particles that might stop a beam particle are shown in red the magnitude of the mean free path depends on the characteristics of the system an expression for the mfp isnnnwhere is the mean free path n is the number of target particles per unit volume and is the effective cross-sectional area for collision.nthe area of the slab is l and its volume is l dx the typical number of stopping atoms in the slab is the concentration n times the volume i.e n l dx the probability that a beam particle will be stopped in that slab is the net area of the stopping atoms divided by the total area of the slab:nnnwhere is the area or more formally the scattering cross-section of one atom.nthe drop in beam intensity equals the incoming beam intensity multiplied by the probability of the particle being stopped within the slab:nnnthis is an ordinary differential equation:nnnwhose solution is known as beer-lambert law and has the form where x is the distance traveled by the beam through the target and i is the beam intensity before it entered the target is called the mean free path because it equals the mean distance traveled by a beam particle before being stopped to see this note that the probability that a particle is absorbed between x and x dx is given bynnnthus the expectation value or average or simply mean of x isnnnthe fraction of particles that are not stopped attenuated by the slab is called transmission where x is equal to the thickness of the slab x dx.nnkinetic theoryeditnin kinetic theory the mean free path of a particle such as a molecule is the average distance the particle travels between collisions with other moving particles the formula still holds for a particle with a high velocity relative to the velocities of an ensemble of identical particles with random locations if on the other hand the velocities of the identical particles have a maxwell distribution the following relationship applies:nnnand using ideal gas law and effective cross-sectional area for spherical particles with radius it may be shown that the mean free path isnnnwhere k is the boltzmann constant.nin practice the diameter of gas molecules is not well defined in fact the kinetic diameter of a molecule is defined in terms of the mean free path typically gas molecules do not behave like hard spheres but rather attract each other at larger distances and repel each other at shorter distances as can be described with a lennard-jones potential one way to deal with such soft molecules is to use the lennard-jones parameter as the diameter another way is to assume a hard-sphere gas that has the same viscosity as the actual gas being considered this leads to a mean free pathnnnwhere m is the molecular mass and is the viscosity.nthese different definitions of the molecular diameter can lead to slightly different values of the mean free path.nnnuclear and particle physicseditnin particle physics the concept of the mean free path is not commonly used being replaced by the similar concept of attenuation length in particular for high-energy photons which mostly interact by electronpositron pair production the radiation length is used much like the mean free path in radiography.nindependent-particle models in nuclear physics require the undisturbed orbiting of nucleons within the nucleus before they interact with other nucleons.nnthe effective mean free path of a nucleon in nuclear matter must be somewhat larger than the nuclear dimensions in order to allow the use of the independent particle model this requirement seems to be in contradiction to the assumptions made in the theory we are facing here one of the fundamental problems of nuclear structure physics which has yet to be solved john markus blatt and
