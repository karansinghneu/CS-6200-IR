kinetic theory of gases wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn the temperature of an ideal monatomic gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of its atoms the size of helium atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 atmospheres of pressure the atoms have a certain average speed slowed down here two trillion fold from room temperature.nthe kinetic theory of gases describes a gas as a large number of submicroscopic particles atoms or molecules all of which are in constant rapid random motion the randomness arises from the particles many collisions with each other and with the walls of the container.nkinetic theory of gases explains the macroscopic properties of gases such as pressure temperature viscosity thermal conductivity and volume by considering their molecular composition and motion the theory posits that gas pressure results from particles collisions with the walls of a container at different velocities.nkinetic molecular theory defines temperature in its own way in contrast with the thermodynamic definition.nunder an optical microscope the molecules making up a liquid are too small to be visible however the jittery motion of pollen grains or dust particles in liquid are visible known as brownian motion the motion of the pollen or dust results from their collisions with the liquids molecules.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnin approximately 50 bce the roman philosopher lucretius proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other this epicurean atomistic point of view was rarely considered in the subsequent centuries when aristotlean ideas were dominant.nn hydrodynamica front covernin 1738 daniel bernoulli published hydrodynamica which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases in this work bernoulli posited the argument still used to this day that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion the theory was not immediately accepted in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.nother pioneers of the kinetic theory which were neglected by their contemporaries were mikhail lomonosov 1747 georges-louis le sage ca 1780 published 1818 john herapath 1816 and john james waterston 1843 which connected their research with the development of mechanical explanations of gravitation in 1856 august krnig probably after reading a paper of waterston created a simple gas-kinetic model which only considered the translational motion of the particles.nin 1857 rudolf clausius according to his own words independently of krnig developed a similar but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to krnig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions in this same work he introduced the concept of mean free path of a particle.n in 1859 after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by rudolf clausius scottish physicist james clerk maxwell formulated the maxwell distribution of molecular velocities which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range this was the first-ever statistical law in physics maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium in his 1873 thirteen page article molecules maxwell states we are told that an atom is a material point invested and surrounded by potential forces and that when flying molecules strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases."nin 1871 ludwig boltzmann generalized maxwells achievement and formulated the maxwellboltzmann distribution also the logarithmic connection between entropy and probability was first stated by him.nin the beginning of the twentieth century however atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs rather than real objects an important turning point was albert einsteins 1905 and marian smoluchowskis 1906npapers on brownian motion which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.nnassumptionseditnthe theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:nnnnnnmore modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the boltzmann equation these can accurately describe the properties of dense gases because they include the volume of the molecules the necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects molecular chaos and small gradients in bulk properties expansions to higher orders in the density are known as virial expansions.nan important book on kinetic theory is that by chapman and cowling an important approach to the subject is called chapmanenskog theory there have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by grad based on moment expansions.nin the other limit for extremely rarefied gases the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths this is known as the knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the knudsen number.nnequilibrium propertieseditnpressure and kinetic energyeditnin kinetic model of gases the pressure is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface consider a gas of n molecules each of mass m enclosed in a cube of volume v l when a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the x axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed an elastic collision the change in momentum is given by:nnnwhere p is the momentum i and f indicate initial and final momentum

transport phenomenanthe kinetic theory of gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium this means using kinetic theory to consider what are known as transport properties such as mass diffusivity viscosity and thermal conductivity the following discussion are all based on transport equation.nndiffusion coefficient and diffusion fluxeditnsee also ficks laws of diffusionnviscosity and kinetic momentumeditnsee also viscosity momentum transportnin books on elementary kinetic theory one can find results for dilute gas modeling that has widespread use nderivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a couette flow where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer the upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force f the lower plate is stationary and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest the molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component which increase uniformly with distance above the lower plate the non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a maxwell-boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.nlet be the collision cross section of one molecule colliding with another the number density is defined as the number of molecules per extensive volume the collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is and it is related to the mean free path by nnnotice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume is reciprocal of length the mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule or a number of molecules per volume before they make their first collision.nlet be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer on the average a molecule that crosses the surface makes its last collision before crossing at a distance equal to two-thirds of the mean free path i.e away from the surface at this distance above and below the surface the forward momentum of the molecule is respectivelynnwhere m is the molecular mass the molecular flux includes all molecules arriving at one side of an element of the surface within the gas layer the incoming molecules are coming from all directions at the one side of the surface and with all speeds this molecular flux i.e the number flux is related to the average molecular speed bynnnotice that the forward velocity gradient can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path next we multiply by the total flux to get the change of momentum per unit time and per unit area that is carried by the molecules crossing from either above or below the surface area this gives the equationnnthe net rate of momentum per unit area that is transported across the imaginary surface is thusnnthe defining equation for the shear viscosity of the gas isnncombining the above kinetic equation with defining equation for shear viscosity by gives the equation for shear viscosity which is usually denoted when it is a dilute gas:nncombining this equation with the equation for mean free path givesnnfrom statistical thermodynamics for gases we have equations relating average molecular speed to most likely speed and further to temperature these statistical results gives the average equilibrium molecular speed asnnwhere is the most probable speed is the boltzmann constant we note thatnnand insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above this gives the well known equation for shear viscosity for dilute gases:nnand is the molar mass the equation above presupposes that the gas density is low i.e the pressure is low this implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies the viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape this assumption of elastic hard core spherical molecules like billiard balls implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated bynnthe radius is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius and the diameter is called collision cross section diameter or kinetic diameter of a molecule in a monomolecular gas there are no simple general relation between the collision cross section and the hard core size of the fairly spherical molecule the relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule for a real spherical molecule i.e a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule the interaction potential is more like the lennard-jones potential or morse potential which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius the radius for zero lennard-jones potential is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.nlocal nomenclature list:nnnnnthermal
