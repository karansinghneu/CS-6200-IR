fly by gaining support from the air it counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines common examples of aircraft include airplanes helicopters airships including blimps gliders and hot air balloons.nthe human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation the science of aviation including designing and building aircraft is called aeronautics crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers aircraft may be classified by different criteria such as lift type aircraft propulsion usage and others.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnmain article history of aviationnsee also timeline of aviationnflying model craft and stories of manned flight go back many centuries however the first manned ascent and safe descent in modern times took place by larger hot-air balloons developed in the 18th century each of the two world wars led to great technical advances consequently the history of aircraft can be divided into five eras:nnnmethods of lifteditnlighter than air aerostatseditnmain article aerostatn hot air balloonsnaerostats use buoyancy to float in the air in much the same way that ships float on the water they are characterized by one or more large gasbags or canopies filled with a relatively low-density gas such as helium hydrogen or hot air which is less dense than the surrounding air when the weight of this is added to the weight of the aircraft structure it adds up to the same weight as the air that the craft displaces.nsmall hot-air balloons called sky lanterns were first invented in ancient china prior to the 3rd century bc and used primarily in cultural celebrations and were only the second type of aircraft to fly the first being kites which were first invented in ancient china over two thousand years ago see han dynasty.nn airship uss akron over manhattan in the 1930sna balloon was originally any aerostat while the term airship was used for large powered aircraft designs usually fixed-wing in 1919 frederick handley page was reported as referring to ships of the air with smaller passenger types as air yachts in the 1930s large intercontinental flying boats were also sometimes referred to as ships of the air or flying-ships though none had yet been built the advent of powered balloons called dirigible balloons and later of rigid hulls allowing a great increase in size began to change the way these words were used huge powered aerostats characterized by a rigid outer framework and separate aerodynamic skin surrounding the gas bags were produced the zeppelins being the largest and most famous there were still no fixed-wing aircraft or non-rigid balloons large enough to be called airships so airship came to be synonymous with these aircraft then several accidents such as the hindenburg disaster in 1937 led to the demise of these airships nowadays a balloon is an unpowered aerostat and an airship is a powered one.na powered steerable aerostat is called a dirigible sometimes this term is applied only to non-rigid balloons and sometimes dirigible balloon is regarded as the definition of an airship which may then be rigid or non-rigid non-rigid dirigibles are characterized by a moderately aerodynamic gasbag with stabilizing fins at the back these soon became known as blimps during the second world war this shape was widely adopted for tethered balloons in windy weather this both reduces the strain on the tether and stabilizes the balloon the nickname blimp was adopted along with the shape in modern times any small dirigible or airship is called a blimp though a blimp may be unpowered as well as powered.nnheavier-than-air aerodyneseditnheavier-than-air aircraft such as airplanes must find some way to push air or gas downwards so that a reaction occurs by newtons laws of motion to push the aircraft upwards this dynamic movement through the air is the origin of the term aerodyne there are two ways to produce dynamic upthrust aerodynamic lift and powered lift in the form of engine thrust.naerodynamic lift involving wings is the most common with fixed-wing aircraft being kept in the air by the forward movement of wings and rotorcraft by spinning wing-shaped rotors sometimes called rotary wings a wing is a flat horizontal surface usually shaped in cross-section as an aerofoil to fly air must flow over the wing and generate lift a flexible wing is a wing made of fabric or thin sheet material often stretched over a rigid frame a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the speed of the wind over its wings which may be flexible or rigid fixed or rotary.nwith powered lift the aircraft directs its engine thrust vertically downward v/stol aircraft such as the harrier jump jet and f-35b take off and land vertically using powered lift and transfer to aerodynamic lift in steady flight.na pure rocket is not usually regarded as an aerodyne because it does not depend on the air for its lift and can even fly into space however many aerodynamic lift vehicles have been powered or assisted by rocket motors rocket-powered missiles that obtain aerodynamic lift at very high speed due to airflow over their bodies are a marginal case.nnfixed-wingeditn an airbus a380 the worlds largest passenger airlinernmain article fixed-wing aircraftnthe forerunner of the fixed-wing aircraft is the kite whereas a fixed-wing aircraft relies on its forward speed to create airflow over the wings a kite is tethered to the ground and relies on the wind blowing over its wings to provide lift kites were the first kind of aircraft to fly and were invented in china around 500 bc much aerodynamic research was done with kites before test aircraft wind tunnels and computer modelling programs became available.nthe first heavier-than-air craft capable of controlled free-flight were gliders a glider designed by george cayley carried out the first true manned controlled flight in 1853.npractical powered fixed-wing aircraft the aeroplane or airplane were invented by wilbur and orville wright besides the method of propulsion fixed-wing aircraft are in general characterized by their wing configuration the most important wing characteristics are:nnna variable geometry aircraft can change its wing configuration during flight.na flying wing has no fuselage though it may have small blisters or pods the opposite of this is a lifting body which has no wings though it may have small stabilizing and control surfaces.nwing-in-ground-effect vehicles are not considered aircraft they fly efficiently close to the surface of the ground or water like conventional aircraft during takeoff an example is the russian ekranoplan nicknamed the caspian sea monster man-powered aircraft also rely on ground effect to remain airborne with a minimal pilot power but this is only because they are so underpoweredin fact the airframe is capable of flying higher.nnrotorcrafteditn an autogyronmain article rotorcraftnrotorcraft or rotary-wing aircraft use a spinning rotor with aerofoil section blades a rotary wing to provide lift types include helicopters autogyros and various hybrids such as gyrodynes and compound rotorcraft.nhelicopters have a rotor turned by an engine-driven shaft the rotor pushes air downward to create lift by tilting the rotor forward the downward flow is tilted backward producing thrust for forward flight some helicopters have more than one rotor and a few have rotors turned by gas jets at the tips.nautogyros have unpowered rotors with a separate power plant to provide thrust the rotor is tilted backward as the autogyro moves forward air blows upward across the rotor making it spin this spinning increases the speed of airflow over the rotor to provide lift rotor kites are unpowered autogyros which are towed to give them forward speed or tethered to a static anchor in high-wind for kited flight.ncyclogyros rotate their wings about a horizontal axis.ncompound rotorcraft have wings that provide some or all of the lift in forward flight they are nowadays classified as powered lift types and not as rotorcraft tiltrotor aircraft such as the v-22 osprey tiltwing tailsitter and coleopter aircraft have their rotors/propellers horizontal for vertical flight and vertical for forward flight.nnother methods of lifteditn x-24b lifting body.nnscale sizes and speedseditnsizeseditnthe smallest aircraft are toys andeven smaller nano-aircraft.nthe largest aircraft by dimensions and volume as of 2016 is the 302-foot-long about 95 meters british airlander 10 a hybrid blimp with helicopter and fixed-wing features and reportedly capable of speeds up to 90 mph about 150 km/h and an airborne endurance of two weeks with a payload of up to 22,050 pounds 11 tons.nthe largest aircraft by weight and largest regular fixed-wing aircraft ever built as of 2016 is the antonov an-225 that ukrainian-built 6-engine russian transport of the 1980s is 84 meters 276 feet long with an 88-meter 289 foot wingspan it holds the world payload record after transporting 428,834 pounds 200 tons of goods and has recently flown 100-ton loads commercially weighing in at somewhere between 1.1 and 1.4 million pounds 550700 tons maximum loaded weight it is also the heaviest aircraft to be built to date it can cruise at 500 mph.nthe largest military airplanes are the ukrainian/russian antonov an-124 worlds second-largest airplane also used as a civilian transport and american lockheed c-5 galaxy transport weighing loaded over 765,000 pounds over 380 tons the 8-engine piston/propeller hughes hk-1 spruce goose an american world war

hop in the late 1940s and never flew out of ground effect.nthe largest civilian airplanes apart from the above-noted an-225 and an-124 are the airbus beluga cargo transport derivative of the airbus a300 jet airliner the boeing dreamlifter cargo transport derivative of the boeing 747 jet airliner/transport the 747-200b was at its creation in the 1960s the heaviest aircraft ever built with a maximum weight of 836,000 pounds over 400 tons and the double-decker airbus a380 super-jumbo jet airliner the worlds largest passenger airliner.nnmain article list of large aircraftnspeedseditnthe

aircraft that do not employ propulsion once airborne take-off may be by launching forward and downward from a high location or by pulling into the air on a tow-line either by a ground-based winch or vehicle or by a powered tug aircraft for a glider to maintain its forward air speed and lift it must descend in relation to the air but not necessarily in relation to the ground many gliders can soar gain height from updrafts such as thermal currents the first practical controllable example was designed and built by the british scientist and pioneer george cayley whom many recognise as the first aeronautical engineer common examples of gliders are sailplanes hang gliders and paragliders.nballoons drift with the wind though normally the pilot can control the altitude either by heating the air or by releasing ballast giving some directional control since the wind direction changes with altitude a wing-shaped hybrid balloon can glide directionally when rising or falling but a spherically shaped balloon does not have such directional control.nkites are aircraft that are tethered to the ground or other object fixed or mobile that maintains tension in the tether or kite line they rely on virtual or real wind blowing over and under them to generate lift and drag kytoons are balloon-kite hybrids that are shaped and tethered to obtain kiting deflections and can be lighter-than-air neutrally buoyant or heavier-than-air.nnpowered aircrafteditnmain article powered aircraftnpowered aircraft have one or more onboard sources of mechanical power typically aircraft engines although rubber and manpower have also been used most aircraft engines are either lightweight piston engines or gas turbines engine fuel is stored in tanks usually in the wings but larger aircraft also have additional fuel tanks in the fuselage.nnpropeller aircrafteditnmain article propeller aircraftn a turboprop-engined dehavilland twin otter adapted as a floatplanenpropeller aircraft use one or more propellers airscrews to create thrust in a forward direction the propeller is usually mounted in front of the power source in tractor configuration but can be mounted behind in pusher configuration variations of propeller layout include contra-rotating propellers and ducted fans.nmany kinds of power plant have been used to drive propellers early airships used man power or steam engines the more practical internal combustion piston engine was used for virtually all fixed-wing aircraft until world war ii and is still used in many smaller aircraft some types use turbine engines to drive a propeller in the form of a turboprop or propfan human-powered flight has been achieved but has not become a practical means of transport unmanned aircraft and models have also used power sources such as electric motors and rubber bands.nnjet aircrafteditnmain article jet aircraftn lockheed martin f-22a raptornjet aircraft use airbreathing jet engines which take in air burn fuel with it in a combustion chamber and accelerate the exhaust rearwards to provide thrust.nturbojet and turbofan engines use a spinning turbine to drive one or more fans which provide additional thrust an afterburner may be used to inject extra fuel into the hot exhaust especially on military fast jets use of a turbine is not absolutely necessary other designs include the pulse jet and ramjet these mechanically simple designs cannot work when stationary so the aircraft must be launched to flying speed by some other method other variants have also been used including the motorjet and hybrids such as the pratt whitney j58 which can convert between turbojet and ramjet operation.ncompared to propellers jet engines can provide much higher thrust higher speeds and above about 40,000 ft 12,000 m greater efficiency they are also much more fuel-efficient than rockets as a consequence nearly all large high-speed or high-altitude aircraft use jet engines.nnrotorcrafteditnmain article rotorcraftnsome rotorcraft such as helicopters have a powered rotary wing or rotor where the rotor disc can be angled slightly forward so that a proportion of its lift is directed forwards the rotor may like a propeller be powered by a variety of methods such as a piston engine or turbine experiments have also used jet nozzles at the rotor blade tips.nnother types of powered aircrafteditnndesign and constructioneditnaircraft are designed according to many factors such as customer and manufacturer demand safety protocols and physical and economic constraints for many types of aircraft the design process is regulated by national airworthiness authorities.nthe key parts of an aircraft are generally divided into three categories:nnnstructureeditnthe approach to structural design varies widely between different types of aircraft some such as paragliders comprise only flexible materials that act in tension and rely on aerodynamic pressure to hold their shape a balloon similarly relies on internal gas pressure but may have a rigid basket or gondola slung below it to carry its payload early aircraft including airships often employed flexible doped aircraft fabric covering to give a reasonably smooth aeroshell stretched over a rigid frame later aircraft employed semi-monocoque techniques where the skin of the aircraft is stiff enough to share much of the flight loads in a true monocoque design there is no internal structure left.nthe key structural parts of an aircraft depend on what type it is.nnaerostatseditnmain article aerostatnlighter-than-air types are characterised by one or more gasbags typically with a supporting structure of flexible cables or a rigid framework called its hull other elements such as engines or a gondola may also be attached to the supporting structure.nnaerodyneseditn airframe diagram for an agustawestland aw101 helicopternheavier-than-air types are characterised by one or more wings and a central fuselage the fuselage typically also carries a tail or empennage for stability and control and an undercarriage for takeoff and landing engines may be located on the fuselage or wings on a fixed-wing aircraft the wings are rigidly attached to the fuselage while on a rotorcraft the wings are attached to a rotating vertical shaft smaller designs sometimes use flexible materials for part or all of the structure held in place either by a rigid frame or by air pressure the fixed parts of the structure comprise the airframe.nnavionicseditnmain article avionicsnthe avionics comprise the flight control systems and related equipment including the cockpit instrumentation navigation radar monitoring and communication systems.nnflight characteristicseditnflight envelopeeditnmain article flight envelopenthe flight envelope of an aircraft refers to its capabilities in terms of airspeed and load factor or altitude the term can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability when a craft is pushed for instance by diving it at high speeds it is said to be flown outside the envelope something considered unsafe.nnrangeeditn the boeing 777-200lr is the longest-range airliner capable of flights of more than halfway around the world.nmain article range aeronauticsnthe range is the distance an aircraft can fly between takeoff and landing as limited by the time it can remain airborne.nfor a powered aircraft the time limit is determined by the fuel load and rate of consumption.nfor an unpowered aircraft the maximum flight time is limited by factors such as weather conditions and pilot endurance many aircraft types are restricted to daylight hours while balloons are limited by their supply of lifting gas the range can be seen as the average ground speed multiplied by the maximum time in the air.nnflight dynamicseditnmain article flight dynamics aircraftnnflight dynamics is the science of air vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions the three critical flight dynamics parameters are the angles of rotation around three axes which pass through the vehicles center of gravity known as pitch roll and yaw.nnnflight dynamics is concerned with the stability and control of an aircrafts rotation about each of these axes.nnstabilityeditn the tail assembly of a boeing 747200nan aircraft that is unstable tends to diverge from its current flight path and so is difficult to fly a very stable aircraft tends to stay on its current flight path and is difficult to manoeuvreso it is important for any design to achieve the desired degree of stability since the widespread use of digital computers it is increasingly common for designs to be inherently unstable and rely on computerised control systems to provide artificial stability.na fixed wing is typically unstable in pitch roll and yaw pitch and yaw stabilities of conventional fixed wing designs require horizontal and vertical stabilisers which act similarly to the feathers on an arrow these stabilizing surfaces allow equilibrium of aerodynamic forces and to stabilise the flight dynamics of pitch and yaw they are usually mounted on the tail section empennage although in the canard layout the main aft wing replaces the canard foreplane as pitch stabilizer tandem wing and tailless aircraft rely on the same general rule to achieve stability the aft surface being the stabilising one.na rotary wing is typically unstable in yaw requiring a vertical stabiliser.na balloon is typically very stable in pitch and roll due to the way the payload is hung underneath.nncontroleditnflight control surfaces enable the pilot to control an aircrafts flight attitude and are usually part of the wing or mounted on or integral with the associated stabilizing surface their development was a critical advance in the history of aircraft which had until that point been uncontrollable in flight.naerospace engineers develop control systems for a vehicles orientation attitude about its center of mass the control systems include actuators which exert forces in various directions and generate rotational forces or moments about the aerodynamic center of the aircraft and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch roll or yaw for example a pitching moment is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the aircraft causing the aircraft to pitch up or down control systems are also sometimes used to increase or decrease drag for example to slow the aircraft to a safe speed for landing.nthe two main aerodynamic forces acting on any aircraft are lift supporting it in the air and drag opposing its motion control surfaces or other techniques may also be used to affect these forces directly without inducing any rotation.nnimpacts of aircraft useeditnmain article environmental impact of aviationnaircraft permit long distance high speed travel and may be a more fuel efficient mode of transportation in some circumstances aircraft have environmental and climate impacts beyond fuel efficiency considerations however they are also relatively noisy compared to other forms of travel and high altitude aircraft generate contrails which experimental evidence suggests may alter weather patterns.nnuses for aircrafteditnaircraft are produced in several different types optimized for various uses military aircraft which includes not just combat types but many types of supporting aircraft and civil aircraft which include all non-military types experimental and model.nnmilitaryeditn boeing b-17e in flightnmain article military aircraftna military aircraft is any aircraft that is operated by a legal or insurrectionary armed service of any type military aircraft can be either combat or non-combat:nnnmost military aircraft are powered heavier-than-air types other types such as gliders and balloons have also been used as military aircraft for example balloons were used for observation during the american civil war and world war i and military gliders were used during world war ii to land troops.nncivileditn agusta a109 helicopter of the swiss air rescue servicenmain article civil aviationncivil aircraft divide into commercial and general types however there are some overlaps.ncommercial aircraft include types designed for scheduled and charter airline flights carrying passengers mail and other cargo the larger passenger-carrying types are the airliners the largest of which are wide-body aircraft some of the smaller types are also used in general aviation and some of the larger types are used as vip aircraft.ngeneral aviation is a catch-all covering other kinds of private where the pilot is not paid for time or expenses and commercial use and involving a wide range of aircraft types such as business jets bizjets trainers homebuilt gliders
