electron-volt and electron volt is a unit of energy equal to approximately 69811600000000000001.610 joules symbol j in si units nhistorically the electronvolt was devised as a standard unit of measure through its usefulness in electrostatic particle accelerator sciences because a particle with charge q has an energy e qv after passing through the potential v if q is quoted in integer units of the elementary charge and the terminal bias in volts one gets an energy in ev.nlike the elementary charge on which it is based it is not an independent quantity but is equal to 1 j/c 2h c it is a common unit of energy within physics widely used in solid state atomic nuclear and particle physics it is commonly used with the metric prefixes milli kilo mega giga tera peta or exa mev kev mev gev tev pev and eev respectively in some older documents and in the name bevatron the symbol bev is used which stands for billion 10 electronvolts it is equivalent to the gev.nnncontentsnnndefinitioneditnan electronvolt is the amount of energy gained or lost by the charge of a single electron moving across an electric potential difference of one volt hence it has a value of one volt 70001000000000000001 j/c multiplied by the electrons elementary charge e 69811602176620799991.60217662089810 c therefore one electronvolt is equal to 69811602176620799991.60217662089810 j the electronvolt is not an si unit and its definition is empirical unlike the litre the light-year and other such non-si units where its value in si units must be obtained experimentally.nnmasseditnby massenergy equivalence the electronvolt is also a unit of mass it is common in particle physics where units of mass and energy are often interchanged to express mass in units of ev/c where c is the speed of light in vacuum from e mc it is common to simply express mass in terms of ev as a unit of mass effectively using a system of natural units with c set to 1 the mass equivalent of 70001000000000000001 ev/c isnnnfor example an electron and a positron each with a mass of 69995110000000000000.511 mev/c can annihilate to yield 69871637424369714001.022 mev of energy the proton has a mass of 69999380000000000000.938 gev/c in general the masses of all hadrons are of the order of 70001000000000000001 gev/c which makes the gev gigaelectronvolt a convenient unit of mass for particle physics:nnnthe unified atomic mass unit u 1 gram divided by avogadros number is almost the mass of a hydrogen atom which is mostly the mass of the proton to convert to megaelectronvolts use the formula:nnnmomentumeditnin high-energy physics the electronvolt is often used as a unit of momentum a potential difference of 1 volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy i.e 69811602176487000001 ev this gives rise to usage of ev and kev mev gev or tev as units of momentum for the energy supplied results in acceleration of the particle.nthe dimensions of momentum units are lmt the dimensions of energy units are lmt then dividing the units of energy such as ev by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity lt facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum in the field of high-energy particle physics the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum c nby dividing energy in ev by the speed of light one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of ev/c.nnthe fundamental velocity constant c is often dropped from the units of momentum by way of defining units of length such that the value of c is unity for example if the momentum p of an electron is said to be 69901602176487000001 gev then the conversion to mks can be achieved by:nnndistanceeditnin particle physics a system of natural units in which the speed of light in vacuum c and the reduced planck constant are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used c 1 in these units both distances and times are expressed in inverse energy units while energy and mass are expressed in the same units see massenergy equivalence in particular particle scattering lengths are often presented in units of inverse particle masses.noutside this system of units the conversion factors between electronvolt second and nanometer are the following:nnnthe above relations also allow expressing the mean lifetime of an unstable particle in seconds in terms of its decay width in ev via for example the b meson has a lifetime of 1.5309 picoseconds mean decay length is c 6996459699999999999459.7 m or a decay width of 69776892563247074004.3022510 ev.nconversely the tiny meson mass differences responsible for meson oscillations are often expressed in the more convenient inverse picoseconds.nenergy in electronvolts is sometimes expressed through the wavelength of light with photons of the same energy 1 ev 8065.54400549 cm nntemperatureeditnin certain fields such as plasma physics it is convenient to use the electronvolt as a unit of temperature the conversion to the kelvin scale is defined by using k the boltzmann constant:nnnfor example a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma is 698524032647304999915 kev or 170 mk.nas an approximation kt is about 69794005441217500000.025 ev 290 k/11604 k/ev at a temperature of 700229315000000000020 c.nnpropertieseditn energy of photons in the visible spectrum in evn graph of wavelength nm to energy evnthe energy e frequency v and wavelength of a photon

69813733071214710002.33 ev similarly 69811602176487000001 ev would correspond to an infrared photon of wavelength 69941240000000000001240 nm or frequency 7014241800000000000241.8 thz.nnscattering experimentseditnin a low-energy nuclear scattering experiment it is conventional to refer to the nuclear recoil energy in units of evr kevr etc this distinguishes the nuclear recoil energy from the electron equivalent recoil energy evee kevee etc measured by scintillation light for example the yield of a phototube is measured in phe/kevee photoelectrons per kev electron-equivalent energy the relationship between ev evr and evee depends on the medium the scattering takes place in and must be established empirically for each material.nnenergy comparisonseditn photon frequency vs energy particle in electronvolts the energy of a photon varies only with the frequency of the photon related by speed of light constant this contrasts with a massive particle of which the energy depends on its velocity and rest mass legend nnnper moleeditnone mole of particles given 1 ev of energy has approximately 96.5 kj of energy this corresponds to the faraday constant f 700496485000000000096485 c
