light-year wikipedia n redirected from light-yearsn jump to navigationnjump to searchnfor other uses see light year disambiguation.nnthe light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances and measures about 9.46 trillion kilometres 9.46 x 10 km or 5.88 trillion miles 5.88 x 10 mi as defined by the international astronomical union iau a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one julian year 365.25 days because it includes the word year the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time.nthe light-year is most often used when expressing distances to stars and other distances on a galactic scale especially in nonspecialist and popular science publications the unit most commonly used in professional astrometry is the parsec symbol pc about 3.26 light-years the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc.nncontentsnnndefinitionseditnas defined by the iau the light-year is the product of the julian year 365.25 days as opposed to the 365.2425-day gregorian year and the speed of light 7008299792458000000299792458 m/s both of these values are included in the iau 1976 system of astronomical constants used since 1984 from this the following conversions can be derived the iau recognized abbreviation for light-year is ly although other standards like iso 80000 use l.y and localized symbols are frequent such as al in french from anne-lumire and spanish from ao luz lj in german from lichtjahr etc.nnnbefore 1984 the tropical year not the julian year and a measured not defined speed of light were included in the iau 1964 system of astronomical constants used from 1968 to 1983 the product of simon newcombs j1900.0 mean tropical year of 700731556925974700031556925.9747 ephemeris seconds and a speed of light of 7008299792500000000299792.5 km/s produced a light-year of 70159460530000000009.46053010 m rounded to the seven significant digits in the speed of light found in several modern sources was probably derived from an old source such as c w allens 1973 astrophysical quantities reference work which was updated in 2000 including the iau 1976 value cited above truncated to 10 significant digits.nother high-precision values are not derived from a coherent iau system a value of 70159460536207000009.46053620710 m found in some modern sources is the product of a mean gregorian year 365.2425 days or 700731556952000000031556952 s and the defined speed of light 7008299792458000000299792458 m/s another value 70159460528405000009.46052840510 m is the product of the j1900.0 mean tropical year and the defined speed of light.nabbreviations used for light years and multiples of light years arennnhistoryeditnthe light-year unit appeared a few years after the first successful measurement of the distance to a star other than the sun by friedrich bessel in 1838 the star was 61 cygni and he used a 6.2-inch 160 mm heliometer designed by joseph von fraunhofer the largest unit for expressing distances across space at that time was the astronomical unit equal to the radius of the earths orbit 70111500000000000001.5010 km or 70111496689920000009.3010 mi in those terms trigonometric calculations based on 61 cygnis parallax of 0.314 arcseconds showed the distance to the star to be 7005660000000000000660000 astronomical units 70169900000000000009.910 km or 70169816998400000006.110 mi bessel added that light employs 10.3 years to traverse this distance he recognized that his readers would enjoy the mental picture of the approximate transit time for light but he refrained from using the light-year as a unit he may have resented expressing distances in light-years because it would deteriorate the accuracy of his parallax data due to multiplying with the uncertain parameter of the speed of light the speed of light was not yet precisely known in 1838 its value changed in 1849 fizeau and 1862 foucault it was not yet considered to be a fundamental constant of nature and the propagation of light through the aether or space was still enigmatic the light-year unit appeared however in 1851 in a german popular astronomical article by otto ule the paradox of a distance unit name ending on year was explained by ule by comparing it to a hiking road hour wegstunde a contemporary german popular astronomical book also noticed that light-year is an odd name in 1868 an english journal labelled the light-year as a unit used by the germans eddington called the light-year an inconvenient and irrelevant unit which had sometimes crept from popular use into technical investigations.nalthough modern astronomers often prefer to use the parsec light years are also popularly used to gauge the expanses of interstellar and intergalactic space.nnusage of termeditndistances expressed in light-years include those between stars in the same general area such as those belonging to the same spiral arm or globular cluster galaxies themselves span from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand light-years in diameter and are separated from neighbouring galaxies and galaxy clusters by millions of light-years distances to objects such as quasars and the sloan great wall run up into the billions of light-years.nnnrelated unitseditndistances between objects within a star system tend to be small fractions of a light year and are usually expressed in astronomical units however smaller units of length can similarly be formed usefully by multiplying units of time by the speed of light for example the light-second useful in astronomy telecommunications and relativistic physics is exactly 7008299792458000000299792458 metres or of a light-year units such as the light-minute light-hour and light-day are sometimes used in popular science publications the light-month roughly one-twelfth of a light-year is also used occasionally for approximate measures the hayden planetarium specifies the light month more precisely as 30 days of light travel time.nlight travels approximately one foot in a nanosecond the term light-foot is sometimes used as an informal measure of time.nnsee alsoeditnnnoteseditnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal
