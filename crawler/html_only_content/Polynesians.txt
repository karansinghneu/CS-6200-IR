oceania in the pacific ocean they are part of the larger austronesian ethnolinguistic group who trace their urheimat to southeast asia they speak the polynesian languages a branch of the oceanic subfamily of the austronesian language family.nthere are an estimated 2 million ethnic polynesians worldwide vast majority of whom inhabit independent polynesian nation states samoa niue cook islands

austronesian peoples they share the same origins as the indigenous peoples of southeast asia especially the philippines malaysia and indonesia madagascar and taiwan this is supported by genetic linguistic and archaeological evidences.nthe origins of the polynesian people are addressed in the theories regarding human migration into the pacific which began about 3,000 years ago these are outlined well by kayser et al 2000 the most widely accepted theory is that modern austronesians originated from migrations out of taiwan between 3000 and 1000 bc travelling via the philippines and eastern indonesia and from the northwest birds head of new guinea on to island melanesia by roughly 1400 bc reaching the western polynesian islands right about 900 bc however soares et al 2008 have argued for an older pre-holocene sundaland origin within island southeast asia isea based on mitochondrial dna.nanalysis by kayser et al 2008 discovered that only 21 of the polynesian autosomal gene pool is of melanesian origin with the rest 79 being of east asian origin another study by friedlaender et al 2008 also confirmed that polynesians are closer genetically to micronesians taiwanese aborigines and east asians than to melanesians the study concluded that polynesians moved through melanesia fairly rapidly allowing only limited admixture between austronesians and melanesians thus the high frequencies of mtdna b4a1a1 in the polynesians are the result of drift and represent the descendants of a few east asian females who mixed with papuan males the polynesian population experienced a founder effect and genetic drift.na popular theory among scholars and native royal polynesian monarchy tongan tahitian hawaiian monarchies is that the genesis point from which polynesia was finally populated was through the polynesian island archipelagos of samoa sacred center the islands of samoa are theorized to have been the gestation point from where which the initial roots of polynesia patiently formulated over time religion philosophy spirituality language arts culture and then spread forth through eastern polynesia through the spreading of samoas religion aitu kahuna tafuna through their polynesian aitu religion the worship of animal human deities and a pantheon of gods and demi-gods which would grow exponentially in eastern polynesia with the construction of monolithic tiki deities in tahiti rapanui and the spread of the spiritual belief of mana a polynesian spiritual life force which governs all living beings nthe last place to be settled by polynesians was aotearoa new zealand estimated at around 1300ad.nrecent dna studies show that the ancestors of the polynesian people are from taiwan and from the northern philippines they did not mix with the melanesians natives but displaced mostly.nthe results of research at the teouma lapita site efate island vanuatu and the talasiu lapita site near nukualofa tonga published in 2016 supports the out of taiwan theory although with the qualification that the migration bypassed new guinea and island melanesia the conclusion from the research published in 2016 is that the initial population of those two sites appears to come directly from taiwan or the northern philippines and did not mix with the australopapuans of new guinea and the solomon islands dna analysis of modern polynesians indicates that there has been intermarriage that results in a mixed asian-papuan ancestry of some polynesians the research at the teouma and talasiu lapita sites implies that the migration and intermarriage which resulted in mixed asian-papuan ancestry of some polynesians occurred after the first initial migration to vanuatu and tonga the preliminary analysis of skulls found at the teouma and talasiu lapita sites is that the skulls lack australian or papuan affinities and instead have affinities to mainland asian populations.nnpeopleeditn female dancers of the hawaii islands depicted by louis choris c
