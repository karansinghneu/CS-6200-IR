community or robotic industries on the moon.ndiscovery of lunar water at the lunar poles by chandrayaan-1 has renewed interest in the moon locating such a colony at one of the lunar poles would also avoid the problem of long lunar nights about 354 hours long a little more than two weeks and allow the colony to take advantage of the continuous sunlight there for generating solar power.npermanent human habitation on a planetary body other than the earth is one of science fictions most prevalent themes as technology has advanced and concerns about the future of humanity on earth have increased the vision of space colonization as an achievable and worthwhile goal has gained momentum because of its proximity to earth the moon is seen as the best and most obvious location for the first permanent off-planet colony currently the main problem hindering the development of such a colony is the high cost of spaceflight.nthere are also several projects that have been proposed for the near future by space tourism startup companies for tourism on the moon.nncontentsnnnproposalseditnn concept art from nasa showing astronauts entering a lunar outpostnthe notion of a lunar colony originated before the space age in 1638 bishop john wilkins wrote a discourse concerning a new world and another planet in which he predicted a human colony on the moon konstantin tsiolkovsky 18571935 among others also suggested such a step from the 1950s onwards a number of concepts and designs have been suggested by scientists engineers and others.nin 1954 science-fiction writer arthur c clarke proposed a lunar base of inflatable modules covered in lunar dust for insulation a spaceship assembled in low earth orbit would launch to the moon and astronauts would set up the igloo-like modules and an inflatable radio mast subsequent steps would include the establishment of a larger permanent dome an algae-based air purifier a nuclear reactor for the provision of power and electromagnetic cannons to launch cargo and fuel to interplanetary vessels in space.nin 1959 john s rinehart suggested that the safest design would be a structure that could float in a stationary ocean of dust since there were at the time this concept was outlined theories that there could be mile-deep dust oceans on the moon the proposed design consisted of a half-cylinder with half-domes at both ends with a micrometeoroid shield placed above the base.nnproject horizoneditnmain article project horizonnproject horizon was a 1959 study regarding the united states armys plan to establish a fort on the moon by 1967 heinz-hermann koelle a german rocket engineer of the army ballistic missile agency abma led the project horizon study it was proposed that the first landing would be carried out by two soldier-astronauts in 1965 and that more construction workers would soon follow it was posited that through numerous launches 61 saturn is and 88 saturn c-2s 245 tons of cargo could be transported to the outpost by 1966.nnlunex projecteditnmain article lunex projectnlunex project was a us air force plan for a manned lunar landing prior to the apollo program in 1961 it envisaged a 21-airman underground air force base on the moon by 1968 at a total cost of 7.5 billion.nnsub-surface baseeditnin 1962 john denike and stanley zahn published their idea of a sub-surface base located at the sea of tranquility this base would house a crew of 21 in modules placed four meters below the surface which was believed to provide radiation shielding on par with earths atmosphere denike and zahn favored nuclear reactors for energy production because they were more efficient than solar panels and would also overcome the problems with the long lunar nights for the life support system an algae-based gas exchanger was proposed.nnmoon villageeditnnthe moon village concept was presented in 2015 village in this context refers to international public and private investors scientists engineers universities and businessmen coming together to discuss interests and capabilities to build and share infrastructure on the moon and in cislunar space for a variety of purposes it is neither an esa project nor a program but being organized loosely by a nonprofit organization seeking to give a platform for an open international architecture and collaboration in other words moon village seeks to create a vision where both international cooperation and the commercialization of space can thrive.nthe open nature of the concept would encompass any kind of lunar activities whether robotic or astronauts 3d printed habitats refueling stations relay orbiters astronomy exploiting resources or even tourism the idea is to achieve at least some degree of coordination and exploitation of potential synergies and to create a permanent sustainable presence on the surface of the moon whether robotic or crewed jan wrner esa director general describes the village simply as an understanding not a single facility this initiative is meant as the first step in coming together as a species and develop the partnerships and know how before attempting to do the same on mars the director general of esa jan wrner states that this vision of synergy can be as inspiring as the international space station but on a truly global international-cooperation basis and he proposes this approach as a replacement for the orbiting international space station which is due to be decommissioned in 2024.nchina has expressed interest and nasa has also expressed interest in the potential synergy it offers to the proposed lunar orbital platform-gateway the private aerospace company blue origin has also expressed early interest and offered to develop a cargo lander with a 4,500 kg 9,900 lb capacity of usable payload astronaut buzz aldrin has long urged his fellow americans to cooperate with international partners to reach the moon.nwhile woerner is the most famous advocate for moon village it is not an esa program instead the concept is being organized loosely by a nonprofit organization established in november 2017 called the moon village association it is a non-profit organization registered in vienna with the mission to create a global forum for the development of the moon village and to potentially implement a permanent human settlement near the lunar south pole taking advantage of continuous sunlight and nearby deposits of ice and other useful volatiles.nnother proposalseditnin 2007 jim burke of the international space university in france said people should plan to preserve humanitys culture in the event of a civilization-stopping asteroid impact with earth a lunar noahs ark was proposed subsequent planning may be taken up by the international lunar exploration working group ilewg.nnmoon explorationeditnexploration through 2017editnmain articles exploration of the moon and list of missions to the moonnexploration of the lunar surface by spacecraft began in 1959 with the soviet unions luna program luna 1 missed the moon but luna 2 made a hard landing impact into its surface and became the first artificial object on an extraterrestrial body the same year the luna 3 mission radioed photographs to earth of the moons hitherto unseen far side marking the beginning of a decade-long series of robotic lunar explorations.nresponding to the soviet program of space exploration us president john f kennedy in 1961 told the us congress on may 25 i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth the same year the soviet leadership made some of its first public pronouncements about landing a man on the moon and establishing a lunar base.ncrewed exploration of the lunar surface began in 1968 when the apollo 8 spacecraft orbited the moon with three astronauts on board this was mankinds first direct view of the far side the following year the apollo 11 apollo lunar module landed two astronauts on the moon proving the ability of humans to travel to the moon perform scientific research work there and bring back sample materials.nadditional missions to the moon continued this exploration phase in 1969 the apollo 12 mission landed next to the surveyor 3 spacecraft demonstrating precision landing capability the use of a manned vehicle on the moons surface was demonstrated in 1971 with the lunar rover during apollo 15 apollo 16 made the first landing within the rugged lunar highlands however interest in further exploration of the moon was beginning to wane among the american public in 1972 apollo 17 was the final apollo lunar mission and further planned missions were scrapped at the directive of president nixon instead focus was turned to the space shuttle and crewed missions in near earth orbit.nin addition to its scientific returns the apollo program also provided valuable lessons about living and working in the lunar environment.nthe soviet manned lunar programs failed to send a manned mission to the moon however in 1966 luna 9 was the first probe to achieve a soft landing and return close-up shots of the lunar surface luna 16 in 1970 returned the first soviet lunar soil samples while in 1970 and 1973 during the lunokhod program two robotic rovers landed on the moon lunokhod 1 explored the lunar surface for 322 days and lunokhod 2 operated on the moon about four months only but covered a third more distance 1974 saw the end of the soviet moonshot two years after the last american manned landing besides the manned landings an abandoned soviet moon program included building the moonbase zvezda which was the first detailed project with developed mockups of expedition vehicles and surface modules.nin the decades following interest in exploring the moon faded considerably and only a few dedicated enthusiasts supported a return however evidence of lunar ice at the poles gathered by nasas clementine 1994 and lunar prospector 1998 missions rekindled some discussion as did the potential growth of a chinese space program that contemplated its own mission to the moon subsequent research suggested that there was far less ice present if any than had originally been thought but that there may still be some usable deposits of hydrogen in other forms however in september 2009 the chandrayaan probe of india carrying an isro instrument discovered that the lunar soil contains 0.1 water by weight overturning hypotheses that had stood for 40 years.nin 2004 us president george w bush called for a plan to return crewed missions to the moon by 2020 since cancelled see constellation program on june 18 2009 nasas lcross/lro mission to the moon was launched the lcross mission was designed to acquire research information to assist with future lunar exploratory missions and was scheduled to conclude with a controlled collision of the craft on the lunar surface lcrosss mission concluded as scheduled with its controlled impact on october 9 2009.nin 2010 due to reduced congressional nasa appropriations president barack obama halted the bush administrations earlier lunar exploration initiative and directed a generic focus on crewed missions to asteroids and mars as well as extending support for the international space station.nnplanned crewed lunar missions 2021 2036editnas of 2016 russia is planning to begin building a human colony on the moon by 2030 initially the moon base would be crewed by no more than 4 people with their number later rising to maximum of 12 people japan also has plans to land a man on the moon by 2030 while the peoples republic of china is currently planning to land a human on the moon by 2036 see chinese lunar exploration program.nthe united states currently 2019 has plans to send a crewed space mission to orbit but not to land on the moon in 2021 while the us trump administration has called for a return of crewed missions to the moon it has currently 2018 not authorized any funding for any such lunar missions in the next 20 years the current administration has focused funding on mars missions what president trump requests is the development of a lunar orbiting station called lunar orbital platform-gateway a stated goal of aerospace company spacex is to enable the creation of a colony on the moon using its upcoming bfr launch system billionaire jeff bezos has outlined his plans for a lunar base in the next decade.nnlunar water iceeditnmain article lunar waternplay media beginning with a full-frame moon in this video the camera flies to the lunar south pole and shows areas of permanent shadow realistic shadows evolve through several months.non 24 september 2009 science magazine reported that the moon mineralogy mapper m on the indian space research organizations isro chandrayaan-1 had detected water on the moon.nm detected absorption features near 2.83.0 m 0.000110.00012 in on the surface of the moon for silicate bodies such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl and/or water-bearing materials on the moon the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters the general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit m data with neutron spectrometer h abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of oh and ho is an ongoing surficial process oh/ho production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.nthe moon mineralogy mapper m an imaging spectrometer was one of the 11 instruments on board chandrayaan-1 whose mission came to a premature end on 29 august 2009 m was aimed at providing the first mineral map of the entire lunar surface.nlunar scientists had discussed the possibility of water repositories for decades they are now increasingly confident that the decades-long debate is over a report says the moon in fact has water in all sorts of places not just locked up in minerals but scattered throughout the broken-up surface and potentially in blocks or sheets of ice at depth the results from the chandrayaan mission are also offering a wide array of watery signals."non november 13 2009 nasa announced that the lcross mission had discovered large quantities of water ice on the moon around the lcross impact site at cabeus robert zubrin president of the mars society relativized the term large the 30 m crater ejected by the probe contained 10 million kilograms of regolith within this ejecta an estimated 100 kg of water was detected that represents a proportion of ten parts per million which is a lower water concentration than that found in the soil of the driest deserts of the earth in contrast we have found continent sized regions on mars which are 600,000 parts per million or 60 water by weight although the moon is very dry on the whole the spot where the lcross impactor hit was chosen for a high concentration of water ice dr zubrins computations are not a sound basis for estimating the percentage of water in the regolith at that site researchers with expertise in that area estimated that the regolith at the impact site contained 5.6 2.9 water ice and also noted the presence of other volatile substances hydrocarbons material containing sulfur carbon dioxide carbon monoxide methane and ammonia were present.nin march 2010 nasa reported that the findings of its mini-sar radar aboard chandrayaan-1 were consistent with ice deposits at the moons north pole it is estimated there is at least 600 million tons of ice at the north pole in sheets of relatively pure ice at least a couple of meters thick.nin march 2014 researchers who had previously published reports on possible abundance of water on the moon reported new findings that refined their predictions substantially lower.nin 2018 it was announced that m infrared data from chandrayaan-1 had been re-analyzed to confirm the existence of water across wide expanses of the moons polar regions.nnadvantages and disadvantageseditnfurther information space colonizationnplacing a colony on a natural body would provide an ample source of material for construction and other uses in space including shielding from cosmic radiation the energy required to send objects from the moon to space is much less than from earth to space this could allow the moon to serve as a source of construction materials within cis-lunar space rockets launched from the moon would require less locally produced propellant than rockets launched from earth some proposals include using electric acceleration devices mass drivers to propel objects off the moon without building rockets others have proposed momentum exchange tethers see below furthermore the moon does have some gravity which experience to date indicates may be vital for fetal development and long-term human health whether the moons gravity roughly one sixth of earths is adequate for this purpose however is uncertain.nin addition the moon is the closest large body in the solar system to earth while some earth-crosser asteroids occasionally pass closer the moons distance is consistently within a small range close to 384,400 km this proximity has several advantages:nnnthere are several disadvantages to the moon as a colony site:nnnlocationseditnfurther information geology of the moonnsoviet astronomer vladislav v shevchenko proposed in 1988 the following three criteria that a lunar outpost should meet:nnnwhile a colony might be located anywhere potential locations for a lunar colony fall into three broad categories.nnpolar regionseditnthere are two reasons why the north pole and south pole of the moon might be attractive locations for a human colony first there is evidence for the presence of water in some continuously shaded areas near the poles second the moons axis of rotation is sufficiently close to being perpendicular to the ecliptic plane that the radius of the moons polar circles is less than 50 km power collection stations could therefore be plausibly located so that at least one is exposed to sunlight at all times thus making it possible to power polar colonies almost exclusively with solar energy solar power would be unavailable only during a lunar eclipse but these events are relatively brief and absolutely predictable any such colony would therefore require a reserve energy supply that could temporarily sustain a colony during lunar eclipses or in the event of any incident or malfunction affecting solar power collection hydrogen fuel cells would be ideal for this purpose since the hydrogen needed could be sourced locally using the moons polar water and surplus solar power moreover due to the moons uneven surface some sites have nearly continuous sunlight for example malapert mountain located near the shackleton crater at the lunar south pole offers several advantages as a site:nnnnasa chose to use a south-polar site for the lunar outpost reference design in the exploration systems architecture study chapter on lunar architecture.nat the north pole the rim of peary crater has been proposed as a favorable location for a base examination of images from the clementine mission appear to show that parts of the crater rim are permanently illuminated by sunlight except during lunar eclipses as a result the temperature conditions are expected to remain very stable at this location averaging 50 c 58 f this is comparable to winter conditions in earths poles of cold in siberia and antarctica the interior of peary crater may also harbor hydrogen deposits.na 1994 bistatic radar experiment performed during the clementine mission suggested the presence of water ice around the south pole the lunar prospector spacecraft reported in 2008 enhanced hydrogen abundances at the south pole and even more at the north pole on the other hand results reported using the arecibo radio telescope have been interpreted by some to indicate that the anomalous clementine radar signatures are not indicative of ice but surface roughness this interpretation however is not universally agreed upon.na potential limitation of the polar regions is that the inflow of solar wind can create an electrical charge on the leeward side of crater rims the resulting voltage difference can affect electrical equipment change surface chemistry erode surfaces and levitate lunar dust.nnequatorial regionseditnthe lunar equatorial regions are likely to have higher concentrations of helium-3 rare on earth but much sought after for use in nuclear fusion research because the solar wind has a higher angle of incidence they also enjoy an advantage in extra-lunar traffic the rotation advantage for launching material is slight due to the moons slow rotation but the corresponding orbit coincides with the ecliptic nearly coincides with the lunar orbit around earth and nearly coincides with the equatorial plane of earth.nseveral probes have landed in the oceanus procellarum area there are many areas and features that could be subject to long-term study such as the reiner gamma anomaly and the dark-floored grimaldi crater.nnfar sideeditnthe lunar far side lacks direct communication with earth though a communication satellite at the l lagrangian point or a network of orbiting satellites could enable communication between the far side of the moon and earth the far side is also a good location for a large radio telescope because it is well shielded from the earth due to the lack of atmosphere the location is also suitable for an array of optical telescopes similar to the very large telescope in chile to date there has been no ground exploration of the far side.nscientists have estimated that the highest concentrations of helium-3 can be found in the maria on the far side as well as near side areas containing concentrations of the titanium-based mineral ilmenite on the near side the earth and its magnetic field partially shields the surface from the solar wind during each orbit but the far side is fully exposed and thus should receive a somewhat greater proportion of the ion stream.nnlunar lava tubeseditn high sun view of a 100 meter deep lunar pit crater that may provide access to a lava tubenlunar lava tubes are a potential location for constructing a lunar base any intact lava tube on the moon could serve as a shelter from the severe environment of the lunar surface with its frequent meteorite impacts high-energy ultra-violet radiation and energetic particles and extreme diurnal temperature variations lava tubes provide ideal positions for shelter because of their access to nearby resources they also have proven themselves as a reliable structure having withstood the test of time for billions of years.nan underground colony would escape the extreme of temperature on the moons surface the average temperature on the surface of the moon is about 5 c the day period about 354 hours has an average temperature of about 107 c 225 f although it can rise as high as 123 c 253 f the night period also 354 hours has an average temperature of about 153 c 243 f underground both periods would be around 23 c 9 f and humans could install ordinary heaters.none such lava tube was discovered in early 2009.nnstructureeditnhabitateditnthere have been numerous proposals regarding habitat modules the designs have evolved throughout the years as mankinds knowledge about the moon has grown and as the technological possibilities have changed the proposed habitats range from the actual spacecraft landers or their used fuel tanks to inflatable modules of various shapes some hazards of the lunar environment such as sharp temperature shifts lack of atmosphere or magnetic field which means higher levels of radiation and micrometeoroids and long nights were unknown early on proposals have shifted as these hazards were recognized and taken into consideration.nnunderground colonieseditnsome suggest building the lunar colony underground which would give protection from radiation and micrometeoroids this would also greatly reduce the risk of air leakage as the colony would be fully sealed from the outside except for a few exits to the surface.nthe construction of an underground base would probably be more complex one of the first machines from earth might be a remote-controlled excavating machine once created some sort of hardening would be necessary to avoid collapse possibly a spray-on concrete-like substance made from available materials a more porous insulating material also made in-situ could then be applied rowley neudecker have suggested melt-as-you-go machines that would leave glassy internal surfaces mining methods such as the room and pillar might also be used inflatable self-sealing fabric habitats might then be put in place to retain air eventually an underground city can be constructed farms set up underground would need artificial sunlight as an alternative to excavating a lava tube could be covered and insulated thus solving the problem of radiation exposure.nan alternative solution is studied in europe by students to excavate a habitat in the ice-filled craters of the moon.nnsurface colonieseditn variant for habitat creation on the surface or over lava tuben a nasa model of a proposed inflatable modulena possibly easier solution would be to build the lunar base on the surface and cover the modules with lunar soil the lunar soil is composed of a unique blend of silica and iron-containing compounds that may be fused into a glass-like solid using microwave energy blacic has studied the mechanical properties of lunar glass and has shown that it is a promising material for making rigid structures if coated with metal to keep moisture out this may allow for the use of lunar bricks in structural designs or the vitrification of loose dirt to form a hard ceramic crust.na lunar base built on the surface would need to be protected by improved radiation and micrometeoroid shielding building the lunar base inside a deep crater would provide at least partial shielding against radiation and micrometeoroids.nartificial magnetic fields have been proposed as a means to provide radiation shielding for long range deep space crewed missions and it might be possible to use similar technology on a lunar colony some regions on the moon possess strong local magnetic fields that might partially mitigate exposure to charged solar and galactic particles.nin a turn from the usual engineer-designed lunar habitats london-based foster partners architectural firm proposed a building construction 3d-printer technology in january 2013 that would use lunar regolith raw materials to produce lunar building structures while using enclosed inflatable habitats for housing the human occupants inside the hard-shell lunar structures overall these habitats would require only ten percent of the structure mass to be transported from earth while using local lunar materials for the other 90 percent of the structure mass.n"printed lunar soil would provide both radiation and temperature insulation inside a lightweight pressurized inflatable with the same dome shape would be the living environment for the first human moon settlers."nthe building technology would include mixing lunar material with magnesium oxide which would turn the moonstuff into a pulp that can be sprayed to form the block when a binding salt is applied that converts this material into a stone-like solid."nterrestrial versions of this 3d-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres 6 ft 7 in of building material per hour with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres 11 ft per hour sufficient to complete a building in a week.nnmoon capitaleditnin 2010 the moon capital competition offered a prize for a design of a lunar habitat intended to be an underground international commercial center capable of supporting a residential staff of 60 people and their families the moon capital is intended to be self-sufficient with respect to food and other material required for life support prize money was provided primarily by the boston society of architects google lunar x prize and the new england council of the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics.nn3d printed structureseditn 1.5-metric-ton 3,300 lb block 3d printed from simulated lunar dust to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a moon base using local materials.non january 31 2013 the esa working with an independent architectural firm tested a 3d-printed structure that could be constructed of lunar regolith for use as a moon base.nnenergyeditnnuclear powereditna nuclear fission reactor might fulfill most of a moon bases power requirements with the help of fission reactors one could overcome the difficulty of the 354 hour lunar night according to nasa a nuclear fission power station could generate a steady 40 kilowatts equivalent to the demand of about eight houses on earth an artists concept of such a station published by nasa envisages the reactor being buried below the moons surface to shield it from its surroundings out from a tower-like generator part reaching above the surface over the reactor radiators would extend into space to send away any heat energy that may be left over.nradioisotope thermoelectric generators could be used as backup and emergency power sources for solar powered colonies.none specific development program in the 2000s was the fission surface power fsp project of nasa and doe a fission power system focused on developing and demonstrating a nominal 40 kwe power system to support human exploration missions the fsp system concept uses conventional low-temperature stainless steel liquid metal-cooled reactor technology coupled with stirling power conversion as of 2010 significant component hardware testing had been successfully completed and a non-nuclear system demonstration test was being fabricated.nhelium-3 mining could be used to provide a substitute for tritium for potential production of fusion power in the future.nnsolar energyeditnfurther information peak of eternal lightnnsolar energy is a possible source of power for a lunar base many of the raw materials needed for solar panel production can be extracted on site however the long lunar night 354 hours or 14.75 earth days is a drawback for solar power on the moons surface this might be solved by building several power plants so that at least one of them is always in daylight another possibility would be to build such a power plant where there is constant or near-constant sunlight such as at the malapert mountain near the lunar south pole or on the rim of peary crater near the north pole since lunar regolith contains structural metals like iron and aluminum solar panels could be mounted high up on locally-built towers that might rotate to follow the sun a third possibility would be to leave the panels in orbit and beam the power down as microwaves.nthe solar energy converters need not be silicon solar panels it may be more advantageous to use the larger temperature difference between sun and shade to run heat engine generators concentrated sunlight could also be relayed via mirrors and used in stirling engines or solar trough generators or it could be used directly for lighting agriculture and process heat the focused heat might also be employed in materials processing to extract various elements from lunar surface materials.nnenergy storageeditnnfuel cells on the space shuttle have operated reliably for up to 17 earth days at a time on the moon they would only be needed for 354 hours 14 days the length of the lunar night fuel cells produce water directly as a waste product current fuel cell technology is more advanced than the shuttles cells pem proton exchange membrane cells produce considerably less heat though their waste heat would likely be useful during the lunar night and are lighter not to mention the reduced mass of the smaller heat-dissipating radiators this makes pems more economical to launch from earth than the shuttles cells pems have not yet been proven in space.ncombining fuel cells with electrolysis would provide a perpetual source of electricity solar energy could be used to provide power during the lunar day and fuel cells at night during the lunar day solar energy would also be used to electrolyze the water created in the fuel cells although there would be small losses of gases that would have to be replaced.neven if lunar colonies could provide themselves access to a near-continuous source of solar energy they would still need to maintain fuel cells or an alternate energy storage system to sustain themselves during lunar eclipses and emergency situations.nntransporteditnearth to mooneditnconventional rockets have been used for most lunar explorations to date the esas smart-1 mission from 2003 to 2006 used conventional chemical rockets to reach orbit and hall effect thrusters to arrive at the moon in 13 months nasa would have used chemical rockets on its ares v booster and lunar surface access module that were being developed for a planned return to the moon around 2019 but this was cancelled the construction workers location finders and other astronauts vital to building would have been taken four at a time in nasas orion spacecraft.nproposed concepts of earth-moon transportation are space elevators.nnon the surfaceeditn a lunar rover being unloaded from a cargo spacecraft conceptual drawingnlunar colonists would need the ability to transport cargo and people to and from modules and spacecraft and to carry out scientific study of a larger area of the lunar surface for long periods of time proposed concepts include a variety of vehicle designs from small open rovers to large pressurized modules with lab equipment and also a few flying or hopping vehicles.nrovers could be useful if the terrain is not too steep or hilly the only rovers to have operated on the surface of the moon as of 2008 are the three apollo lunar roving vehicles lrv developed by boeing the two robotic soviet lunokhods and the chinese yutu rover in 2013 the lrv was an open rover for a crew of two and a range of 92 km during one lunar day one nasa study resulted in the mobile lunar laboratory concept a crewed pressurized rover for a crew of two with a range of 396 km the soviet union developed different rover concepts in the lunokhod series and the l5 for possible use on future crewed missions to the moon or mars these rover designs were all pressurized for longer sorties.nif multiple bases were established on the lunar surface they could be linked together by permanent railway systems both conventional and magnetic levitation maglev systems have been proposed for the transport lines mag-lev systems are particularly attractive as there is no atmosphere on the surface to slow down the train so the vehicles could achieve velocities comparable to aircraft on the earth one significant difference with lunar trains however is that the cars would need to be individually sealed and possess their own life support systems.nfor difficult areas a flying vehicle may be more suitable bell aerosystems proposed their design for the lunar flying vehicle as part of a study for nasa while bell proposes the manned flying system a similar concept.nnsurface to spaceeditnlaunch technologyeditn a lunar base with a mass driver the long structure that goes toward the horizon nasa conceptual illustrationnexperience so far indicates that launching human beings into space is much more expensive than launching cargo.none way to get materials and products from the moon to an interplanetary way station might be with a mass driver a magnetically accelerated projectile launcher cargo would be picked up from orbit or an earth-moon lagrangian point by a shuttle craft using ion propulsion solar sails or other means and delivered to earth orbit or other destinations such as near-earth asteroids mars or other planets perhaps using the interplanetary transport network.na lunar space elevator could transport people raw materials and products to and from an orbital station at lagrangian points l or l chemical rockets would take a payload from earth to the l lunar lagrange location from there a tether would slowly lower the payload to a soft landing on the lunar surface.nother possibilities include a momentum exchange tether system.nnlaunch costseditnnsurface to and from cis-lunar spaceeditna cis-lunar transport system has been proposed using tethers to achieve momentum exchange this system requires zero net energy input and could not only retrieve payloads from the lunar surface and transport them to earth but could also soft land payloads on to the lunar surface.nneconomic developmenteditnnfor long term sustainability a space colony should be close to self-sufficient mining and refining the moons materials on-site for use both on the moon and elsewhere in the solar system could provide an advantage over deliveries from earth as they can be launched into space at a much lower energy cost than from earth it is possible that large amounts of cargo would need to be launched into space for interplanetary exploration in the 21st century and the lower cost of providing goods from the moon might be attractive.nnspace-based materials processingeditnin the long term the moon will likely play an important role in supplying space-based construction facilities with raw materials zero gravity in space allows for the processing of materials in ways impossible or difficult on earth such as foaming metals where a gas is injected into a molten metal and then the metal is annealed slowly on earth the gas bubbles rise and burst but in a zero gravity environment that does not happen the annealing process requires large amounts of energy as a material is kept very hot for an extended period of time this allows the molecular structure to realign.nnexporting material to eartheditnexporting material to earth in trade from the moon is more problematic due to the cost of transportation which would vary greatly if the moon is industrially developed see launch costs above one suggested trade commodity is helium-3 he which is carried by the solar wind and accumulated on the moons surface over billions of years but occurs only rarely on earth helium-3 might be present in the lunar regolith in quantities of 0.01 ppm to 0.05 ppm depending on soil in 2006 it had a market price of about 1,500 per gram 1.5m per kilogram more than 120 times the value per unit weight of gold and over eight times the value of rhodium.nin the future he harvested from the moon may have a role as a fuel in thermonuclear fusion reactors it should require about 100 metric tons 220,000 lb of helium-3 to produce the electricity that earth uses in a year and there should be enough on the moon to provide that much for 10,000 years.nnexporting propellant obtained from lunar watereditnto reduce the cost of transport the moon could store propellants produced from lunar water at one or several depots between the earth and the moon to resupply rockets or satellites in earth orbit the shackleton energy company estimate investment in this infrastructure could cost around 25 billion.nnsolar power satelliteseditngerard k oneill noting the problem of high launch costs in the early 1970s came up with the idea of building solar power satellites in orbit with materials from the moon launch costs from the moon would vary greatly if the moon is industrially developed see launch costs above this proposal was based on the contemporary estimates of future launch costs of the space shuttle.non 30 april 1979 the final report lunar resources utilization for space construction by general dynamics convair division under nasa contract nas9-15560 concluded that use of lunar resources would be cheaper than terrestrial materials for a system comprising as few as thirty solar power satellites of 10 gw capacity each.nin 1980 when it became obvious nasas launch cost estimates for the space shuttle were grossly optimistic oneill et al published another route to manufacturing using lunar materials with much lower startup costs this 1980s sps concept relied less on human presence in space and more on partially self-replicating systems on the lunar surface under telepresence control of workers stationed on earth.nnsee alsoeditnnnnnnreferenceseditnnnotesnnnngeneral referencesnnnnfurther readingeditnnexternal
