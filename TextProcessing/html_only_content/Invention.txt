historic inventionsn build your own television receiver science and invention magazine cover november 1928nan invention is a unique or novel device method composition or process the invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process it may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result an invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field an inventor may be taking a big step in success or failure.nsome inventions can be patented a patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention the rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary from country to country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.nanother meaning of invention is cultural invention which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others the institute for social inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books.ninvention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge experience or capability.nncontentsnnnthree areas of inventionninventions are of three kinds scientific-technologicalnincluding medicine sociopolitical including economics and law and humanistic or cultural.nscientific-technological inventions include railroads,naviation vaccination hybridization antibiotics astronautics holography the atomic bomb computing the internet and the smartphone.nsociopolitical inventions comprise new laws institutions and procedures that change modes of social behavior and establish new forms of human interaction and organization examples include the british parliament the us constitution the manchester uk general union of trades the boy scouts the red cross the olympic games the united nations the european union and the universal declaration of human rights as well as movements such as socialism zionism suffragism feminism and animal-rights veganism.nhumanistic inventions encompass culture in its entirety and are as transformative and important as any in the sciences although people tend to take them for granted in the domain of linguistics for example many alphabets have been inventions as are all neologisms shakespeare invented about 1,700 words literary inventions include the epic tragedy comedy the novel the sonnet thenrenaissance neoclassicism romanticism symbolism aestheticism socialist realism surrealism postmodernism and according to freud psychoanalysis among the inventions of artists and musicians are oil painting printmaking photography cinema musical tonality atonality jazz rock opera and the symphony orchestra philosophers have invented logic several times dialectics idealism materialism utopia anarchism semiotics phenomenology behaviorism positivism pragmatism and deconstruction religious thinkers are responsible for such inventions as monotheism pantheism methodism mormonism iconoclasm puritanism deism secularism ecumenism and bahai some of these disciplines genres and trends may seem to have existed eternally or to have emerged spontaneously of their own accord but most of them have had inventors.nnnprocess of inventionnpractical means of inventionn alessandro volta with the first electrical battery volta is recognized as one of the most influential inventors of all time.nidea for an invention may be developed on paper or on a computer by writing or drawing by trial and error by making models by experimenting by testing and/or by making the invention in its whole form brainstorming also can spark new ideas for an invention collaborative creative processes are frequently used by engineers designers architects and scientists co-inventors are frequently named on patents.nin addition many inventors keep records of their working process notebooks photos etc including leonardo da vinci galileo galilei evangelista torricelli thomas jefferson and albert einstein.nin the process of developing an invention the initial idea may change the invention may become simpler more practical it may expand or it may even morph into something totally different working on one invention can lead to others too.nhistory shows that turning the concept of an invention into a working device is not always swift or direct inventions may also become more useful after time passes and other changes occur for example the parachute became more useful once powered flight was a reality.nnconceptual meansn thomas edison with phonograph edison was one of the most prolific inventors in history holding 1,093 u.s patents in his name.ninvention is often a creative process an open and curious mind allows an inventor to see beyond what is known seeing a new possibility connection or relationship can spark an invention inventive thinking frequently involves combining concepts or elements from different realms that would not normally be put together sometimes inventors disregard the boundaries between distinctly separate territories or fields several concepts may be considered when thinking about invention.nnplaynplay may lead to invention childhood curiosity experimentation and imagination can develop ones play instinct inventors feel the need to play with things that interest them and to explore and this internal drive brings about novel creations.nsometimes inventions and ideas may seem to arise spontaneously while daydreaming especially when the mind is free from its usual concerns for example both j k rowling the creator of harry potter and frank hornby the inventor of meccano first had their ideas while on train journeys.nin contrast the successful aerospace engineer max munk advocated aimful thinking".nnre-envisionnto invent is to see anew inventors often envision a new idea seeing it in their minds eye new ideas can arise when the conscious mind turns away from the subject or problem when the inventors focus is on something else or while relaxing or sleeping a novel idea may come in a flasha eureka moment for example after years of working to figure out the general theory of relativity the solution came to einstein suddenly in a dream like a giant die making an indelible impress a huge map of the universe outlined itself in one clear vision inventions can also be accidental such as in the case of polytetrafluoroethylene teflon.nninsightninsight can also be a vital element of invention such inventive insight may begin with questions doubt or a hunch it may begin by recognizing that something unusual or accidental may be useful or that it could open a new avenue for exploration for example the odd metallic color of plastic made by accidentally adding a thousand times too much catalyst led scientists to explore its metal-like properties inventing electrically conductive plastic and light emitting plastic-an invention that won the nobel prize in 2000 and has led to innovative lighting display screens wallpaper and much more see conductive polymer and organic light-emitting diode or oled.nnexplorationn a rare 1884 photo showing the experimental recording of voice patterns by a photographic process at the alexander graham bell laboratory in washington d.c many of their experimental designs panned out in failure.ninvention is often an exploratory process with an uncertain or unknown outcome there are failures as well as successes inspiration can start the process but no matter how complete the initial idea inventions typically must be developed.nnimprovementninventors may for example try to improve something by making it more effective healthier faster more efficient easier to use serve more purposes longer lasting cheaper more ecologically friendly or aesthetically different lighter weight more ergonomic structurally different with new light or color properties etc.nnimplementing inventionsn western arabic numerals an example of non-material inventions.n railways probably the most important invention in land transport railway station in bratislava slovakianin economic theory inventions are one of the chief examples of positive externalities a beneficial side-effect that falls on those outside a transaction or activity one of the central concepts of economics is that externalities should be internalizedunless some of the benefits of this positive externality can be captured by the parties the parties are under-rewarded for their inventions and systematic under-rewarding leads to under-investment in activities that lead to inventions the patent system captures those positive externalities for the inventor or other patent owner so that the economy as a whole invests an optimum amount of resources in the invention process.nninvention vs innovationnmain article innovationnin the social sciences an innovation is something that is new and better and has been adopted and proven to create positive value this is a key distinction from an invention which may not create positive value but furthers progress in a given area of development the theory for adoption of an innovation called diffusion of innovations considers the likelihood that an innovation is adopted and the taxonomy of persons likely to adopt it or spur its adoption this theory was first put forth by everett rogers gabriel tarde also dealt with the adoption of innovations in his laws of imitation.nnpurposes of inventionnan invention can serve many purposes and does not necessarily create positive value these purposes might differ significantly and may change over time an invention or its development may serve purposes never envisioned by its inventors plastic is a good example.nninvention as defined by patent lawnnsee also patentabilityn u.s patentnthe term invention is also an important legal concept and central to patent law systems worldwide as is often the case for legal concepts its legal meaning is slightly different from common usage of the word additionally the legal concept of invention is quite different in american and european patent law.nin europe the first test a patent application must pass is is this an invention if it is subsequent questions are whether it is new and sufficiently inventive the implicationcounter-intuitivelyis that a legal invention is not inherently novel whether a patent application relates to an invention is governed by article 52 of the european patent convention that excludes e.g discoveries as such and software as such the epo boards of appeal decided that the technical character of an application is decisive for it to represent an invention following an age-old italians and german tradition british courts dont agree with this interpretation following a 1959 australian decision nrdc they believe that it is not possible to grasp the invention concept in a single rule a british court once stated that the technical character test implies a restatement of the problem in more imprecise terminology."nin the united states all patent applications are considered inventions the statute explicitly says that the american invention concept includes discoveries 35 usc 100a contrary to the european invention concept the european invention concept corresponds to the american patentable subject matter concept the first test a patent application is submitted to while the statute 35 usc 101 virtually poses no limits to patenting whatsoever courts have decided in binding precedents that abstract ideas natural phenomena and laws of nature are not patentable various attempts were made to substantiate the abstract idea test which suffers from abstractness itself but eventually none of them was successful the last attempt so far was the machine or transformation test but the u.s supreme court decided in 2010 that it is merely an indication at best.nninvention in the artsninvention has a long and important history in the arts inventive thinking has always played a vital role in the creative process while some inventions in the arts are patentable others are not because they cannot fulfill the strict requirements governments have established for granting them see patent.nsome inventions in art include the:nnnlikewise jackson pollock invented an entirely new form of painting and a new kind of abstraction by dripping pouring splashing and splattering paint onto un-stretched canvas lying on the floor.ninventive tools of the artists trade also produced advances in creativity impressionist painting became possible because of newly invented collapsible resealable metal paint tubes that facilitated spontaneous painting outdoors inventions originally created in the form of artwork can also develop other uses i.e alexander calders mobile which is now commonly used over babies cribs funds generated from patents on inventions in art design and architecture can support the realization of the invention or other creative work frdric auguste bartholdis 1879 design patent on the statue of liberty helped fund the famous statue because it covered small replicas including those sold as souvenirs.nthe timeline for invention
