measure of the number of digits that a number has in the commonly-used base-ten number system it is equal to the logarithm base 10 rounded to a whole number for example the order of magnitude of 1500 is 3 because 1500 1.5 10.ndifferences in order of magnitude can be measured on a base-10 logarithmic scale in decades i.e factors of ten examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at orders of magnitude numbers.nncontentsnnndefinitioneditngenerally the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number to work out the order of magnitude of a number the number is first expressed in the following form:nnnwhere then represents the order of magnitude of the number the order of magnitude can be any integer the table below enumerates the order of magnitude of some numbers in light of this definition:nnnthe geometric mean of and is meaning that a value of exactly i.e represents a geometric halfway point within the range of possible values of nsome use a simpler definition where perhaps because the arithmetic mean of and approaches for increasing this definition has the effect of lowering the values of slightly:nnnyet others restrict to values where making the order of magnitude of a number exactly equal to its exponent part in scientific notation.nnuseseditnorders of magnitude are used to make approximate comparisons if numbers differ by one order of magnitude x is about ten times different in quantity than y if values differ by two orders of magnitude they differ by a factor of about 100 two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.nnncalculating the order of magnitudeeditnthe order of magnitude of a number is intuitively speaking the number of powers of 10 contained in the number more precisely the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the common logarithm usually as the integer part of the logarithm obtained by truncation for example the number 70064000000000000004000000 has a logarithm in base 10 of 6.602 its order of magnitude is 6 when truncating a number of this order of magnitude is between 10 and 10 in a similar example with the phrase he had a seven-figure income the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one so it is very easily determined without a calculator to 6 an order of magnitude is an approximate position on a logarithmic scale.nnorder-of-magnitude estimateeditnan order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable whose precise value is unknown is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten for example an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion such as the human population of the earth is 10 billion to round a number to its nearest order of magnitude one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer thus 70064000000000000004000000 which has a logarithm in base 10 of 6.602 has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude because nearest implies rounding rather than truncation for a number written in scientific notation this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten about 3.162 for example the nearest order of magnitude for 70081700000000000001.710 is 8 whereas the nearest order of magnitude for 70083700000000000003.710 is 9 an order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a zeroth order approximation.nnorder of magnitude differenceeditnan order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10 for example the mass of the planet saturn is 95 times that of earth so saturn is two orders of magnitude more massive than earth order-of-magnitude differences are called decades when measured on a logarithmic scale.nnnon-decimal orders of magnitudeeditnsee also logarithmic scalenother orders of magnitude may be calculated using bases other than 10 the ancient greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred about 2.512 as bright as the nearest weaker level of brightness and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is 100 or a factor of 100 times brighter.nthe different decimal numeral systems of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number and have created names for the powers of this larger base the table shows what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base 70061000000000000001000000 it can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example because bi means 2 and tri means 3 these make sense in the long scale only and the suffix illion tells that the base is 70061000000000000001000000 but the number names billion trillion themselves here with other meaning than in the first chapter are not names of the orders of magnitudes they are names of magnitudes that is the numbers 70121000000000000001000000000000 etc.nnnsi units in the table at right are used together with si prefixes which were devised with mainly base 1000 magnitudes in mind the iec standard prefixes with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.nthe ancient apparent magnitudes for the brightness of stars uses the base and is reversed the modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values.nnextremely large numberseditnfor extremely large numbers a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their double logarithm or super-logarithm rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very round numbers rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the nearest round number.nthe double logarithm yields the categories:nnnthe first two mentioned and the extension to the left may not be very useful they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left.nthe super-logarithm yields the categories:nnnnthe midpoints which determine which round number is nearer are in the first case:nnnand depending on the interpolation method in the second casennnfor extremely small numbers in the sense of close to zero neither method is suitable directly but the generalized order of magnitude of the reciprocal can be considered.nsimilar to the logarithmic scale one can have a double logarithmic scale example provided here and super-logarithmic scale the intervals above all have the same length on them with the midpoints actually midway more generally a point midway between two points corresponds to the generalised f-mean with fx the corresponding function log log x or slog x in the case of log log x this mean of two numbers e.g 2 and 16 giving 4 does not depend on the base of the logarithm just like in the case of log x geometric mean 2 and 8 giving 4 but unlike in the case of log log log x 4 and 700465536000000000065536 giving 16 if the base is 2 but not otherwise.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnfurther readingeditnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn ncategories n
