vapour pressure of water wikipedia n redirected from vapor pressure of watern jump to navigationnjump to searchnthe vapour pressure of water is the pressure at which water vapour is in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed state at higher pressures water would condense the water vapour pressure is the partial pressure of water vapour in any gas mixture in equilibrium with solid or liquid water as for other substances water vapour pressure is a function of temperature and can be determined with the clausiusclapeyron relation.nnncontentsnnnapproximation formulaseditnthere are many published approximations for calculating saturated vapour pressure over water and over ice some of these are in approximate order of increasing accuracy:nnnnnnnnnwhere temperature t is in c and vapour pressure p is in kilopascals kpannnnwhere temperature t is in c and p is in kpannnnwhere t is in c and p is in kpa.nnnaccuracy of different formulationseditnhere is a comparison of the accuracies of these different explicit formulations showing saturation vapour pressures for liquid water in kpa calculated at six temperatures with their percentage error from the table values of lide 2005:nnna more detailed discussion of accuracy and considerations of the inaccuracy in temperature measurements is presented in alduchov and eskridge 1996 the analysis here shows the simple unattributed formula and the antoine equation are reasonably accurate at 100 c but quite poor for lower temperatures above freezing tetens is much more accurate over the range from 0 to 50 c and very competitive at 75 c but antoines is superior at 75 c and above the unattributed formula must have zero error at around 26 c but is of very poor accuracy outside a very narrow range tetens equations are generally much more accurate and arguably simpler for use at everyday temperatures e.g in meteorology as expected bucks equation for t 0 c is significantly more accurate than tetens and its superiority increases markedly above 50 c though it is more complicated to use the buck equation is even superior to the more complex goff-gratch equation over the range needed for practical meteorology.nnnumerical approximationseditnfor serious computation lowe 1977 developed two pairs of equations for temperatures above and below freezing with different levels of accuracy they are all very accurate compared to clausius-clapeyron and the goff-gratch but use nested polynomials for very efficient computation however there are more recent reviews of possibly superior formulations notably wexler 1976 1977 reported by flatau et al 1992.nngraphical pressure dependency on temperatureeditn vapour pressure diagrams of water data taken from dortmund data bank graphics shows triple point critical point and boiling point of water.nsee alsoeditnnnreferenceseditnnnfurther readingeditnnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn ncategories n
