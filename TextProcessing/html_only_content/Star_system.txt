star system see planetary system.n"multiple star redirects here for visual multiples see double star.nnnna star system or stellar system is a small number of stars that orbit each other bound by gravitational attraction a large number of stars bound by gravitation is generally called a star cluster or galaxy although broadly speaking they are also star systems star systems are not to be confused with planetary systems which include planets and similar bodies such as comets.na star system of two stars is known as a binary star binary star system or physical double star if there are no tidal effects no perturbation from other forces and no transfer of mass from one star to the other such a system is stable and both stars will trace out an elliptical orbit around the barycenter of the system indefinitely see two-body problem examples of binary systems are sirius procyon and cygnus x-1 the last of which probably consists of a star and a black hole.na multiple star system consists of three or more stars that appear from earth to be close to one another in the sky this may result from the stars actually being physically close and gravitationally bound to each other in which case it is a physical multiple star or this closeness may be merely apparent in which case it is an optical multiple star meaning that the stars may appear to be close to each other when viewed from planet earth as they both seem to occupy the same point in the sky but in reality one star may be much further away from earth than the other which is not readily apparent unless one can view them from a different angle physical multiple stars are also commonly called multiple stars or multiple star systems.nmost multiple star systems are triple stars systems with four or more components are less likely to occur multiple-star systems are called triple trinary or ternary if they contain three stars quadruple or quaternary if they contain four stars quintuple or quintenary with five stars sextuple or sextenary with six stars septuple or septenary with seven stars these systems are smaller than open star clusters which have more complex dynamics and typically have from 100 to 1,000 stars most multiple star systems known are triple for higher multiplicities the number of known systems with a given multiplicity decreases exponentially with multiplicity for example in the 1999 revision of tokovinins catalog of physical multiple stars 551 out of the 728 systems described are triple however because of selection effects knowledge of these statistics is very incomplete.nmultiple-star systems can be divided into two main dynamical classes hierarchical systems which are stable and consist of nested orbits that dont interact much and so each level of the hierarchy can be treated as a two-body problem or the trapezia which have unstable strongly interacting orbits and are modelled as an n-body problem exhibiting chaotic behavior.nncontentsnnnhierarchical systemseditn star system named di cha while only two stars are apparent it is actually a quadruple system containing two sets of binary stars.nmost multiple-star systems are organized in what is called a hierarchical system the stars in the system can be divided into two smaller groups each of which traverses a larger orbit around the systems center of mass each of these smaller groups must also be hierarchical which means that they must be divided into smaller subgroups which themselves are hierarchical and so on each level of the hierarchy can be treated as a two-body problem by considering close pairs as if they were a single star in these systems there is little interaction between the orbits and the stars motion will continue to approximate stable keplerian orbits around the systems center of mass unlike the unstable trapezia systems or the even more complex dynamics of the large number of stars in star clusters and galaxies.nntriple star systemseditnnin a physical triple star system each star orbits the center of mass of the system usually two of the stars form a close binary system and the third orbits this pair at a distance much larger than that of the binary orbit this arrangement is called hierarchical the reason for this is that if the inner and outer orbits are comparable in size the system may become dynamically unstable leading to a star being ejected from the system triple stars that are not all gravitationally bound might comprise a physical binary and an optical companion such as beta cephei or rarely a purely optical triple star such as gamma serpentis.nnhigher multiplicitieseditn mobile diagrams nhierarchical multiple star systems with more than three stars can produce a number of more complicated arrangements which can be illustrated by what evans 1968 has called a mobile diagram these are similar to ornamental mobiles hung from the ceiling some examples can be seen in the figure to the right each level of the diagram illustrates the decomposition of the system into two or more systems with smaller size evans calls a diagram multiplex if there is a node with more than two children i.e if the decomposition of some subsystem involves two or more orbits with comparable size because as we have already seen for triple stars this may be unstable multiple stars are expected to be simplex meaning that at each level there are exactly two children evans calls the number of levels in the diagram its hierarchy.nnnhigher hierarchies are also possible most of these higher hierarchies either are stable or suffer from internal perturbations others consider complex multiple stars will in time theoretically disintegrate into less complex multiple stars like more common observed triples or quadruples are possible.nntrapeziaeditntrapezia are usually very young unstable systems these are thought to form in stellar nurseries and quickly fragment into stable multiple stars which in the process may eject components as galactic high-velocity stars they are named after the multiple star system known as the trapezium cluster in the heart of the orion nebula such systems are not rare and commonly appear close to or within bright nebulae these stars have no standard hierarchical arrangements but compete for stable orbits this relationship is called interplay such stars eventually settle down to a close binary with a distant companion with the other stars previously in the system ejected into interstellar space at high velocities example of such events may explain the runaway stars that might have been ejected during a collision of two binary star groups or a multiple system this event is credited with ejecting ae aurigae mu columbae and 53 arietis at above 200 kms and has been traced to the trapezium cluster in the orion nebula some two million years ago.nndesignations and nomenclatureeditnmultiple star designationseditnthe components of multiple stars can be specified by appending the suffixes a b c etc to the systems designation suffixes such as ab may be used to denote the pair consisting of a and b the sequence of letters b c etc may be assigned in order of separation from the component a components discovered close to an already known component may be assigned suffixes such as aa ba and so forth.nnnomenclature in the multiple star catalogueeditn subsystem notation in tokovinins multiple star cataloguena a tokovinins multiple star catalogue uses a system in which each subsystem in a mobile diagram is encoded by a sequence of digits in the mobile diagram d above for example the widest system would be given the number 1 while the subsystem containing its primary component would be numbered 11 and the subsystem containing its secondary component would be numbered 12 subsystems which would appear below this in the mobile diagram will be given numbers with three four or more digits when describing a non-hierarchical system by this method the same subsystem number will be used more than once for example a system with three visual components a b and c no two of which can be grouped into a subsystem would have two subsystems numbered 1 denoting the two binaries ab and ac in this case if b and c were subsequently resolved into binaries they would be given the subsystem numbers 12 and 13.nnfuture multiple star system nomenclatureeditnthe current nomenclature for double and multiple stars can cause confusion as binary stars discovered in different ways are given different designations for example discoverer designations for visual binary stars and variable star designations for eclipsing binary stars and worse component letters may be assigned differently by different authors so that for example one persons a can be anothers c discussion starting in 1999 resulted in four proposed schemes to address this problem:nnnfor a designation system identifying the hierarchy within the system has the advantage that it makes identifying subsystems and computing their properties easier however it causes problems when new components are discovered at a level above or intermediate to the existing hierarchy in this case part of the hierarchy will shift inwards components which are found to be nonexistent or are later reassigned to a different subsystem also cause problems.nduring the 24th general assembly of the international astronomical union in 2000 the wmc scheme was endorsed and it was resolved by commissions 5 8 26 42 and 45 that it should be expanded into a usable uniform designation scheme a sample of a catalog using the wmc scheme covering half an hour of right ascension was later prepared the issue was discussed again at the 25th general assembly in 2003 and it was again resolved by commissions 5 8 26 42 and 45 as well as the working group on interferometry that the wmc scheme should be expanded and further developed.nthe sample wmc is hierarchically organized the hierarchy used is based on observed orbital periods or separations since it contains many visual double stars which may be optical rather than physical this hierarchy may be only apparent it uses upper-case letters a b for the first level of the hierarchy lower-case letters a b for the second level and numbers 1 2 for the third subsequent levels would use alternating lower-case letters and numbers but no examples of this were found in the sample.nnexampleseditnbinaryeditn sirius a center with its white dwarf companion sirius b lower left taken by the hubble space
