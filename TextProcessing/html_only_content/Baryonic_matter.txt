contains an odd number of valence quarks at least 3 baryons belong to the hadron family of particles which are the quark-based particles they are also classified as fermions i.e they have half-integer spin nthe name baryon comes from the greek word for heavy bars because at the time of their naming most known elementary particles had lower masses than the baryons each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle antibaryon where their corresponding antiquarks replace quarks for example a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and its corresponding antiparticle the antiproton is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.nas quark-based particles baryons participate in the strong interaction which is mediated by particles known as gluons the most familiar baryons are protons and neutrons both of which contain three quarks and for this reason these particles are sometimes described as triquarks these particles make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe as well as forming the components of the nucleus of every atom electrons the other major component of the atom are members of a different family of particles known as leptons which do not interact via the strong force exotic baryons containing five quarks known as pentaquarks have also been discovered and studied.nncontentsnnnbackgroundeditnbaryons are strongly interacting fermions that is they are acted on by the strong nuclear force and are described by fermidirac statistics which apply to all particles obeying the pauli exclusion principle this is in contrast to the bosons which do not obey the exclusion principle.nbaryons along with mesons are hadrons particles composed of quarks quarks have baryon numbers of b 1/3 and antiquarks have baryon numbers of b 1/3 the term baryon usually refers to triquarksbaryons made of three quarks b 1/3 1/3 1/3 1.nother exotic baryons have been proposed such as pentaquarksbaryons made of four quarks and one antiquark b 1/3 1/3 1/3 1/3 1/3 1 but their existence is not generally accepted the particle physics community as a whole did not view their existence as likely in 2006 and in 2008 considered evidence to be overwhelmingly against the existence of the reported pentaquarks however in july 2015 the lhcb experiment observed two resonances consistent with pentaquark states in the j/kp decay with a combined statistical significance of 15.nin theory heptaquarks 5 quarks 2 antiquarks nonaquarks 6 quarks 3 antiquarks etc could also exist.nnbaryonic mattereditnnearly all matter that may be encountered or experienced in everyday life is baryonic matter which includes atoms of any sort and provides them with the property of mass non-baryonic matter as implied by the name is any sort of matter that is not composed primarily of baryons this might include neutrinos and free electrons dark matter supersymmetric particles axions and black holes.nthe very existence of baryons is also a significant issue in cosmology because it is assumed that the big bang produced a state with equal amounts of baryons and antibaryons the process by which baryons came to outnumber their antiparticles is called baryogenesis.nnbaryogenesiseditnmain article baryogenesisnexperiments are consistent with the number of quarks in the universe being a constant and to be more specific the number of baryons being a constant in technical language the total baryon number appears to be conserved within the prevailing standard model of particle physics the number of baryons may change in multiples of three due to the action of sphalerons although this is rare and has not been observed under experiment some grand unified theories of particle physics also predict that a single proton can decay changing the baryon number by one however this has not yet been observed under experiment the excess of baryons over antibaryons in the present universe is thought to be due to non-conservation of baryon number in the very early universe though this is not well understood.nnpropertieseditnisospin and chargeeditnmain article isospinn combinations of three u d or s quarks forming baryons with a spin-3/2 form the uds baryon decupletn combinations of three u d or s quarks forming baryons with a spin-1/2 form the uds baryon octetnthe concept of isospin was first proposed by werner heisenberg in 1932 to explain the similarities between protons and neutrons under the strong interaction although they had different electric charges their masses were so similar that physicists believed they were the same particle the different electric charges were explained as being the result of some unknown excitation similar to spin this unknown excitation was later dubbed isospin by eugene wigner in 1937.nthis belief lasted until murray gell-mann proposed the quark model in 1964 containing originally only the u d and s quarks the success of the isospin model is now understood to be the result of the similar masses of u and d quarks since u and d quarks have similar masses particles made of the same number then also have similar masses the exact specific u and d quark composition determines the charge as u quarks carry charge 2/3 while d quarks carry charge 1/3 for example the four deltas all have different charges uuu uud udd ddd but have similar masses 1,232 mev/c as they are each made of a combination of three u and d quarks under the isospin model they were considered to be a single particle in different charged states.nthe mathematics of isospin was modeled after that of spin isospin projections varied in increments of 1 just like those of spin and to each projection was associated a charged state since the delta particle had four charged states it was said to be of isospin i 3/2 its charged states and corresponded to the isospin projections i 3/2 i 1/2 i 1/2 and i 3/2 respectively another example is the nucleon particle as there were two nucleon charged states it was said to be of isospin 1/2 the positive nucleon n proton was identified with i 1/2 and the neutral nucleon n neutron with i 1/2 it was later noted that the isospin projections were related to the up and down quark content of particles by the relation:nnnwhere the ns are the number of up and down quarks and antiquarks.nin the isospin picture the four deltas and the two nucleons were thought to be the different states of two particles however in the quark model deltas are different states of nucleons the n or n are forbidden by paulis exclusion principle isospin although conveying an inaccurate picture of things is still used to classify baryons leading to unnatural and often confusing nomenclature.nnflavour quantum numberseditnmain article flavour particle physics flavour quantum numbersnthe strangeness flavour quantum number s not to be confused with spin was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass the higher the mass the lower the strangeness the more s quarks particles could be described with isospin projections related to charge and strangeness mass see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right as other quarks were discovered new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets since only the u and d mass are similar this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u one d and one other quark and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets for example ucb octet and decuplet if the quarks all had the same mass their behaviour would be called symmetric as they would all behave in the same way to the strong interaction since quarks do not have the same mass they do not interact in the same way exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass and the symmetry is said to be broken.nit was noted that charge q was related to the isospin projection i the baryon number b and flavour quantum numbers s c b t by the gell-mannnishijima formula:nnnwhere s c b and t represent the strangeness charm bottomness and topness flavour quantum numbers respectively they are related to the number of strange charm bottom and top quarks and antiquark according to the relations:nnnmeaning that the gell-mannnishijima formula is equivalent to the expression of charge in terms of quark content:nnnspin orbital angular momentum and total angular momentumeditnmain articles spin physics angular momentum operator quantum numbers and clebschgordan coefficientsnspin quantum number s is a vector quantity that represents the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle it comes in increments of 1/2 pronounced h-bar the is often dropped because it is the fundamental unit of spin and it is implied that spin 1 means spin 1 in some systems of natural units is chosen to be 1 and therefore does not appear anywhere.nquarks are fermionic particles of spin 1/2 s 1/2 because spin projections vary in increments of 1 that is 1 a single quark has a spin vector of length 1/2 and has two spin projections s 1/2 and s 1/2 two quarks can have their spins aligned in which case the two spin vectors add to make a vector of length s 1 and three spin projections s 1 s 0 and s 1 if two quarks have unaligned spins the spin vectors add up to make a vector of length s 0 and has only one spin projection s 0 etc since baryons are made of three quarks their spin vectors can add to make a vector of length s 3/2 which has four spin projections s 3/2 s 1/2 s 1/2 and s 3/2 or a vector of length s 1/2 with two spin projections s 1/2 and s 1/2.nthere is another quantity of angular momentum called the orbital angular momentum azimuthal quantum number l that comes in increments of 1 which represent the angular moment due to quarks orbiting around each other the total angular momentum total angular momentum quantum number j of a particle is therefore the combination of intrinsic angular momentum spin and orbital angular momentum it can take any value from j l s to j l s in increments of 1.nnnnnparticle physicists are most interested in baryons with no orbital angular momentum l 0 as they correspond to ground statesstates of minimal energy therefore the two groups of baryons most studied are the s 1/2 l 0 and s 3/2 l 0 which corresponds to j 1/2 and j 3/2 respectively although they are not the only ones it is also possible to obtain j 3/2 particles from s 1/2 and l 2 as well as s 3/2 and l 2 this phenomenon of having multiple particles in the same total angular momentum configuration is called degeneracy how to distinguish between these degenerate baryons is an active area of research in baryon spectroscopy.nnparityeditnmain article parity physicsnif the universe were reflected in a mirror most of the laws of physics would be identicalthings would behave the same way regardless of what we call left and what we call right this concept of mirror reflection is called intrinsic parity or simply parity p gravity the electromagnetic force and the strong interaction all behave in the same way regardless of whether or not the universe is reflected in a mirror and thus are said to conserve parity p-symmetry however the weak interaction does distinguish left from right a phenomenon called parity violation p-violation.nbased on this if the wavefunction for each particle in more precise terms the quantum field for each particle type were simultaneously mirror-reversed then the new set of wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy the laws of physics apart from the weak interaction it turns out that this is not quite true for the equations to be satisfied the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by 1 in addition to being mirror-reversed such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity p 1 or alternatively p while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity p 1 or alternatively p nfor baryons the parity is related to the orbital angular momentum by the relation:nnnas a consequence baryons with no orbital angular momentum l 0 all have even parity p nnnomenclatureeditnbaryons are classified into groups according to their isospin i values and quark q content there are six groups of baryonsnucleon n delta lambda sigma xi and omega the rules for classification are defined by the particle data group these rules consider the up u down d and strange s quarks to be light and the charm c bottom b and top t quarks to be heavy the rules cover all the particles that can be made from three of each of the six quarks even though baryons made of top quarks are not expected to exist because of the top quarks short lifetime the rules do not cover pentaquarks.nnnit is also a widespread but not universal practice to follow some additional rules when distinguishing between some states that would otherwise have the same symbol.nnnquarks carry a charge so knowing the charge of a particle indirectly gives the quark content for example the rules above say that a contains a c quark and some combination of two u and/or d quarks the c quark has a charge of q 2/3 therefore the other two must be a u quark q 2/3 and a d quark q 1/3 to have the correct total charge q 1.nnsee
