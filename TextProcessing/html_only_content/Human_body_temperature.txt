human body temperature wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnnnormal human body temperature also known as normothermia or euthermia is the typical temperature range found in humans the normal human body temperature range is typically stated as 36.537.5 c 97.799.5 f.nindividual body temperature depends upon the age exertion infection sex and reproductive status of the subject the time of day the place in the body at which the measurement is made and the subjects state of consciousness waking sleeping or sedated activity level and emotional state it is typically maintained within this range by thermoregulation.nncontentsnnnmethods of measurementeditn a medical thermometer showing a temperature reading of 700231184999999999938.7 cntaking a persons temperature is an initial part of a full clinical examination there are various types of medical thermometers as well as sites used for measurement including:nnnvariationseditn diurnal variation in body temperature ranging from about 700231065000000000037.5 c from 10 a.m to 6 p.m and falling to about 700230954999999999936.4 c from 2 a.m to 6 a.m.ntemperature control thermoregulation is part of a homeostatic mechanism that keeps the organism at optimum operating temperature as the temperature affects the rate of chemical reactions in humans the average internal temperature is 37.0 c 98.6 f though it varies among individuals however no person always has exactly the same temperature at every moment of the day temperatures cycle regularly up and down through the day as controlled by the persons circadian rhythm the lowest temperature occurs about two hours before the person normally wakes up additionally temperatures change according to activities and external factors.nin addition to varying throughout the day normal body temperature may also differ as much as 0.5 c 0.9 f from one day to the next so that the highest or lowest temperatures on one day will not always exactly match the highest or lowest temperatures on the next day.nnormal human body temperature varies slightly from person to person and by the time of day consequently each type of measurement has a range of normal temperatures the range for normal human body temperatures taken orally is 700230995000000000036.80.5 c 700230992777777777798.20.9 f this means that any oral temperature between 36.3 and 37.3 c 97.3 and 99.1 f is likely to be normal.nthe normal human body temperature is often stated as 36.537.5 c 97.799.5 f in adults a review of the literature has found a wider range of 33.238.2 c 91.8100.8 f for normal temperatures depending on the gender and location measured.nreported values vary depending on how it is measured oral under the tongue 700230995000000000036.80.4 c 700230992777777777798.20.72 f internal rectal vaginal 37.0 c 98.6 f a rectal or vaginal measurement taken directly inside the body cavity is typically slightly higher than oral measurement and oral measurement is somewhat higher than skin measurement other places such as under the arm or in the ear produce different typical temperatures while some people think of these averages as representing normal or ideal measurements a wide range of temperatures has been found in healthy people the body temperature of a healthy person varies during the day by about 0.5 c 0.9 f with lower temperatures in the morning and higher temperatures in the late afternoon and evening as the bodys needs and activities change other circumstances also affect the bodys temperature the core body temperature of an individual tends to have the lowest value in the second half of the sleep cycle the lowest point called the nadir is one of the primary markers for circadian rhythms the body temperature also changes when a person is hungry sleepy sick or cold.nnnatural rhythmseditnbody temperature normally fluctuates over the day following circadian rhythms with the lowest levels around 4 a.m and the highest in the late afternoon between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m assuming the person sleeps at night and stays awake during the day therefore an oral temperature of 37.3 c 99.1 f would strictly speaking be a normal healthy temperature in the afternoon but not in the early morning an individuals body temperature typically changes by about 0.5 c 0.9 f between its highest and lowest points each day.nbody temperature is sensitive to many hormones so women have a temperature rhythm that varies with the menstrual cycle called a circamensal rhythm a womans basal body temperature rises sharply after ovulation as estrogen production decreases and progesterone increases fertility awareness programs use this change to identify when a woman has ovulated in order to achieve or avoid pregnancy during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle both the lowest and the average temperatures are slightly higher than during other parts of the cycle however the amount that the temperature rises during each day is slightly lower than typical so the highest temperature of the day is not very much higher than usual hormonal contraceptives both suppress the circamensal rhythm and raise the typical body temperature by about 0.6 c 1.1 f.ntemperature also varies with the change of seasons during each year this pattern is called a circannual rhythm studies of seasonal variations have produced inconsistent results people living in different climates may have different seasonal patterns.nincreased physical fitness increases the amount of daily variation in temperature.nwith increased age both average body temperature and the amount of daily variability in the body temperature tend to decrease elderly patients may have a decreased ability to generate body heat during a fever so even a somewhat elevated temperature can indicate a serious underlying cause in geriatrics.nnmeasurement methodseditnndifferent methods used for measuring temperature produce different results the temperature reading depends on which part of the body is being measured the typical daytime temperatures among healthy adults are as follows:nnngenerally oral rectal gut and core body temperatures although slightly different are well-correlated.noral temperatures are influenced by drinking chewing smoking and breathing with the mouth open mouth breathing cold drinks or food reduce oral temperatures hot drinks hot food chewing and smoking raise oral temperatures.neach measurement method also has different normal ranges depending on sex.nnvariations due to outside factorseditnmany outside factors affect the measured temperature as well normal values are generally given for an otherwise healthy non-fasting adult dressed comfortably indoors in a room that is kept at a normal room temperature 22.7 to 24.4 c 73 to 76 f during the morning but not shortly after arising from sleep furthermore for oral temperatures the subject must not have eaten drunk or smoked anything in at least the previous fifteen to twenty minutes as the temperature of the food drink or smoke can dramatically affect the reading.ntemperature is increased after eating or drinking anything with calories caloric restriction as for a weight-loss diet decreases overall body temperature drinking alcohol decreases the amount of daily change slightly lowering daytime temperatures and noticeably raising nighttime temperatures.nexercise raises body temperatures in adults a noticeable increase usually requires strenuous exercise or exercise sustained over a significant time children develop higher temperatures with milder activities like playing.npsychological factors also influence body temperature a very excited person often has an elevated temperature.nwearing more clothing slows daily temperature change and raises body temperature similarly sleeping with an electric blanket raises the body temperature at night.nsleep disturbances also affect temperatures normally body temperature drops significantly at a persons normal bedtime and throughout the night short-term sleep deprivation produces a higher temperature at night than normal but long-term sleep deprivation appears to reduce temperatures insomnia and poor sleep quality are associated with smaller and later drops in body temperature similarly waking up unusually early sleeping in jet lag and changes to shift work schedules may affect body temperature.nnconceptseditnfevereditnmain article feverna temperature setpoint is the level at which the body attempts to maintain its temperature when the setpoint is raised the result is a fever most fevers are caused by infectious disease and can be lowered if desired with antipyretic medications.nan early morning temperature higher than 37.2 c 99.0 f or a late afternoon temperature higher than 37.7 c 99.9 f is normally considered a fever assuming that the temperature is elevated due to a change in the hypothalamuss setpoint lower thresholds are sometimes appropriate for elderly people the normal daily temperature variation is typically 0.5 c 0.90 f but can be greater among people recovering from a fever.nan organism at optimum temperature is considered afebrile or apyrexic meaning without fever if temperature is raised but the setpoint is not raised then the result is hyperthermia.nnhyperthermiaeditnmain article hyperthermianhyperthermia occurs when the body produces or absorbs more heat than it can dissipate it is usually caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures the heat-regulating mechanisms of the body eventually become overwhelmed and unable to deal effectively with the heat causing the body temperature to climb uncontrollably hyperthermia at or above about 40 c 104 f is a life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment common symptoms include headache confusion and fatigue if sweating has resulted in dehydration then the affected person may have dry red skin.nin a medical setting mild hyperthermia is commonly called heat exhaustion or heat prostration severe hyperthermia is called heat stroke heat stroke may come on suddenly but it usually follows the untreated milder stages treatment involves cooling and rehydrating the body fever-reducing drugs are useless for this condition this may be done through moving out of direct sunlight to a cooler and shaded environment drinking water removing clothing that might keep heat close to the body or sitting in front of a fan bathing in tepid or cool water or even just washing the face and other exposed areas of the skin can be helpful.nwith fever the bodys core temperature rises to a higher temperature through the action of the part of the brain that controls the body temperature with hyperthermia the body temperature is raised without the influence of the heat control centers.nnhypothermiaeditnmain article hypothermianin hypothermia body temperature drops below that required for normal metabolism and bodily functions in humans this is usually due to excessive exposure to cold air or water but it can be deliberately induced as a medical treatment symptoms usually appear when the bodys core temperature drops by 12 c 1.83.6 f below normal temperature.nnbasal body temperatureeditnmain article basal body temperaturenbasal body temperature is the lowest temperature attained by the body during rest usually during sleep it is generally measured immediately after awakening and before any physical activity has been undertaken although the temperature measured at that time is somewhat higher than the true basal body temperature in women temperature differs at various points in the menstrual cycle and this can be used in the long-term to track ovulation both for the purpose of aiding conception or avoiding pregnancy this process is called fertility awareness.nncore temperatureeditncore temperature also called core body temperature is the operating temperature of an organism specifically in deep structures of the body such as the liver in comparison to temperatures of peripheral tissues core temperature is normally maintained within a narrow range so that essential enzymatic reactions can occur significant core temperature elevation hyperthermia or depression hypothermia that is prolonged for more than a brief period of time is incompatible with human life.ntemperature examination in the rectum is the traditional gold standard measurement used to estimate core temperature oral temperature is affected by hot or cold drinks and mouth-breathing rectal temperature is expected to be approximately one fahrenheit degree higher than an oral temperature taken on the same person at the same time ear thermometers measure eardrum temperature using infrared sensors the blood supply to the tympanic membrane is shared with the brain however this method of measuring body temperature is not as accurate as rectal measurement and has a low sensitivity for fevers missing three or four out of every ten fevers in children ear temperature measurement may be acceptable for observing trends in body temperature but is less useful in consistently identifying fevers.nuntil recently direct measurement of core body temperature required surgical insertion of a probe so a variety of indirect methods have commonly been used the rectal or vaginal temperature is generally considered to give the most accurate assessment of core body temperature particularly in hypothermia in the early 2000s ingestible thermistors in capsule form were produced allowing the temperature inside the digestive tract to be transmitted to an external receiver one study found that these were comparable in accuracy to rectal temperature measurement.nntemperature variationeditnnhoteditnnnormaleditnncoldeditnnhistorical understandingeditnin the 19th century most books quoted blood heat as 98 f until a study published the mean but not the variance of a large sample as 36.88 c 98.38 f subsequently that mean was widely quoted as 37 c or 98.4 f until editors realised 37 c is closer to 98.6 f than 98.4 f the 37 c value was set by german physician carl reinhold august wunderlich in his 1868 book which put temperature charts into widespread clinical use dictionaries and other sources that quoted these averages did add the word about to show that there is some variance but generally did not state how wide the variance is.nnreferenceseditnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
