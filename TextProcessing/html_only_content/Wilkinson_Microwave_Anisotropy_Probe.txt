anisotropy probe wmap originally known as the microwave anisotropy probe map was a spacecraft operating from 2001 to 2010 which measured temperature differences across the sky in the cosmic microwave background cmb the radiant heat remaining from the big bang headed by professor charles l bennett of johns hopkins university the mission was developed in a joint partnership between the nasa goddard space flight center and princeton university the wmap spacecraft was launched on june 30 2001 from florida the wmap mission succeeded the cobe space mission and was the second medium-class midex spacecraft in the nasa explorers program in 2003 map was renamed wmap in honor of cosmologist david todd wilkinson 19352002 who had been a member of the missions science team after nine years of operations wmap was switched off in 2010 following the launch of the more advanced planck spacecraft by esa in 2009.nwmaps measurements played a key role in establishing the current standard model of cosmology the lambda-cdm model the wmap data are very well fit by a universe that is dominated by dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant other cosmological data are also consistent and together tightly constrain the model in the lambda-cdm model of the universe the age of the universe is 700113772000000000013.7720.059 billion years the wmap missions determination of the age of the universe is to better than 1 precision the current expansion rate of the universe is see hubble constant 700169319999999999969.320.80 kmsmpc the content of the universe currently consists of

energy in the form of a cosmological constant that accelerates the expansion of the universe less than 1 of the current content of the universe is in neutrinos but wmaps measurements have found for the first time in 2008 that the data prefer the existence of a cosmic neutrino background with an effective number of neutrino species of 70003260000000000003.260.35 the contents point to a euclidean flat geometry with curvature of 30027300000000000000.0027+0.00390.0038 the wmap measurements also support the cosmic inflation paradigm in several ways including the flatness measurement.nthe mission has won various awards according to science magazine the wmap was the breakthrough of the year for 2003 this missions results papers were first and second in the super hot papers in science since 2003 list of the all-time most referenced papers in physics and astronomy in the inspire-hep database only three have been published since 2000 and all three are wmap publications bennett lyman a page jr and david n spergel the latter both of princeton university shared the 2010 shaw prize in astronomy for their work on wmap bennett and the wmap science team were awarded the 2012 gruber prize in cosmology the 2018 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics was awarded to bennett gary hinshaw norman jarosik page spergel and the wmap science team.nas of october 2010 the wmap spacecraft is derelict in a heliocentric graveyard orbit after 9 years of operations all wmap data are released to the public and have been subject to careful scrutiny the final official data release was the nine-year release in 2012.nsome aspects of the data are statistically unusual for the standard model of cosmology for example the largest angular-scale measurement the quadrupole moment is somewhat smaller than the model would predict but this discrepancy is not highly significant a large cold spot and other features of the data are more statistically significant and research continues into these.nncontentsnnnobjectiveseditn the universes timeline from the big bang to the wmapnthe wmap objective was to measure the temperature differences in the cosmic microwave background cmb radiation the anisotropies then were used to measure the universes geometry content and evolution and to test the big bang model and the cosmic inflation theory for that the mission created a full-sky map of the cmb with a 13 arcminute resolution via multi-frequency observation the map required the fewest systematic errors no correlated pixel noise and accurate calibration to ensure angular-scale accuracy greater than its resolution the map contains 3,145,728 pixels and uses the healpix scheme to pixelize the sphere the telescope also measured the cmbs e-mode polarization and foreground polarization its service life was 27 months 3 to reach the l position 2 years of observation.nn a comparison of the sensitivity of wmap with cobe and penzias and wilsons telescope simulated data.ndevelopmenteditnthe map mission was proposed to nasa in 1995 selected for definition study in 1996 and approved for development in 1997.nthe wmap was preceded by two missions to observe the cmb i the soviet relikt-1 that reported the upper-limit measurements of cmb anisotropies and ii the u.s cobe satellite that first reported large-scale cmb fluctuations the wmap was 45 times more sensitive with 33 times the angular resolution of its cobe satellite predecessor the successor european planck mission operational 20092013 had a higher resolution and higher sensitivity than wmap and observed in 9 frequency bands rather than wmaps 5 allowing improved astrophysical foreground models.nnspacecrafteditn wmap spacecraft diagramnthe telescopes primary reflecting mirrors are a pair of gregorian 1.4m 1.6m dishes facing opposite directions that focus the signal onto a pair of 0.9m 1.0m secondary reflecting mirrors they are shaped for optimal performance a carbon fibre shell upon a korex core thinly-coated with aluminium and silicon oxide the secondary reflectors transmit the signals to the corrugated feedhorns that sit on a focal plane array box beneath the primary reflectors.nn illustration of wmaps receiversnthe receivers are polarization-sensitive differential radiometers measuring the difference between two telescope beams the signal is amplified with hemt low-noise amplifiers built by the national radio astronomy observatory there are 20 feeds 10 in each direction from which a radiometer collects a signal the measure is the difference in the sky signal from opposite directions the directional separation azimuth is 180 degrees the total angle is 141 degrees to improve subtraction of foreground signals from our milky way galaxy the wmap used five discrete radio frequency bands from 23 ghz to 94 ghz.nnnnnthe wmaps base is a 5.0m-diameter solar panel array that keeps the instruments in shadow during cmb observations by keeping the craft constantly angled at 22 degrees relative to the sun upon the array sit a bottom deck supporting the warm components and a top deck the telescopes cold components the focal-plane array and the mirrors are separated from the warm components with a cylindrical 33 cm-long thermal isolation shell atop the deck.npassive thermal radiators cool the wmap to ca 90 degrees k they are connected to the low-noise amplifiers the telescope consumes 419 w of power the available telescope heaters are emergency-survival heaters and there is a transmitter heater used to warm them when off the wmap spacecrafts temperature is monitored with platinum resistance thermometers.nthe wmaps calibration is effected with the cmb dipole and measurements of jupiter the beam patterns are measured against jupiter the telescopes data are relayed daily via a 2 ghz transponder providing a 667kbit/s downlink to a 70m deep space network telescope the spacecraft has two transponders one a redundant back-up they are minimally active ca 40 minutes daily to minimize radio frequency interference the telescopes position is maintained in its three axes with three reaction wheels gyroscopes two star trackers and sun sensors and is steered with eight hydrazine thrusters.nnlaunch trajectory and orbiteditnanimation of wmaps trajectoryoblique viewviewed from earth earth wmapnthe wmap spacecraft arrived at the kennedy space center on april 20 2001 after being tested for two months it was launched via delta ii 7425 rocket on june 30 2001 it began operating on its internal power five minutes before its launching and so continued operating until the solar panel array deployed the wmap was activated and monitored while it cooled on july 2 it began working first with in-flight testing from launching until august 17 then began constant formal work afterwards it effected three earth-moon phase loops measuring its sidelobes then flew by the moon on july 30 en route to the sun-earth l lagrangian point arriving there on october 1 2001 becoming the first cmb observation mission posted there.nthe spacecrafts location at lagrange 2 1.5 million kilometers from earth minimizes the amount of contaminating solar terrestrial and lunar emissions registered and thermally stabilizes it to view the entire sky without looking to the sun the wmap traces a path around l in a lissajous orbit ca 1.0 degree to 10 degrees with a 6-month period the telescope rotates once every 2 minutes 9 seconds 0.464 rpm and precesses at the rate of 1 revolution per hour wmap measured the entire sky every six months and completed its first full-sky observation in april 2002.nnnforeground radiation subtractioneditnthe wmap observed in five frequencies permitting the measurement and subtraction of foreground contamination from the milky way and extra-galactic sources of the cmb the main emission mechanisms are synchrotron radiation and free-free emission dominating the lower frequencies and astrophysical dust emissions dominating the higher frequencies the spectral properties of these emissions contribute different amounts to the five frequencies thus permitting their identification and subtraction.nforeground contamination is removed in several ways first subtract extant emission maps from the wmaps measurements second use the components known spectral values to identify them third simultaneously fit the position and spectra data of the foreground emission using extra data sets foreground contamination was reduced by using only the full-sky map portions with the least foreground contamination whilst masking the remaining map portions.nnnmeasurements and discoverieseditnone-year data releaseeditn 1 year wmap image of background cosmic radiation 2003.non february 11 2003 nasa published the first-years worth of wmap data the latest calculated age and composition of the early universe were presented in addition an image of the early universe that contains such stunning detail that it may be one of the most important scientific results of recent years was presented the newly released data surpass previous cmb measurements.nbased upon the lambda-cdm model the wmap team produced cosmological parameters from the wmaps first-year results three sets are given below the first and second sets are wmap data the difference is the addition of spectral indices predictions of some inflationary models the third data set combines the wmap constraints with those from other cmb experiments acbar and cbi and constraints from the 2df galaxy redshift survey and lyman alpha forest measurements there are degenerations among the parameters the most significant is between and the errors given are at 68 confidence.nnnnnusing the best-fit data and theoretical models the wmap team determined the times of important

image of background cosmic radiation 2006.nthe three-year wmap data were released on march 17 2006 the data included temperature and polarization measurements of the cmb which provided further confirmation of the standard flat lambda-cdm model and new evidence in support of inflation.nthe 3-year wmap data alone shows that the universe must have dark matter results were computed both only using wmap data and also with a mix of parameter constraints from other instruments including other cmb experiments acbar cbi and boomerang sdss the 2df galaxy redshift survey the supernova legacy

evidence for the cosmic neutrino background evidence that it took over half billion years for the first stars to reionize the universe and new constraints on cosmic inflation.nnthe five-year total-intensity and polarization spectra from wmapmatter/energy content in the current universe top and at the time of photon decoupling in the recombination epoch 380,000 years after the big bang bottomnthe improvement in the results came from both having an extra 2 years of measurements the data set runs between midnight on august 10 2001 to midnight of august 9 2006 as well as using improved data processing techniques and a better characterization of the instrument most notably of the beam shapes they also make use of the 33 ghz observations for estimating cosmological parameters previously only the 41 ghz and 61 ghz channels had been used.nimproved masks were used to remove foregrounds improvements to the spectra were in the 3rd acoustic peak and the polarization spectra.nthe measurements put constraints on the content of the universe at the time that the cmb was emitted at the time 10 of the universe was made up of neutrinos 12 of atoms 15 of photons and 63 dark matter the contribution of dark energy at the time was negligible it also constrained the content of the present-day universe 4.6 atoms 23 dark matter and 72 dark energy.nthe wmap five-year data was combined with measurements from type ia supernova sne and baryon acoustic oscillations bao.nthe elliptical shape of the wmap skymap is the result of a mollweide projection.nnnnnthe data puts limits on the value of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r 0.22 95 certainty which determines the level at which gravitational waves affect the polarization of the cmb and also puts limits on the amount of primordial non-gaussianity improved constraints were put on the redshift of reionization which is 700110900000000000010.91.4 the redshift of decoupling 70031090880000000001090.880.72 as well as age of universe

sources and variability was detected in the emission from mars and saturn.nnnseven-year data releaseeditnn 7-year wmap image of background cosmic radiation 2010.nthe seven-year wmap data were released on january 26 2010 as part of this release claims for inconsistencies with the standard model were investigated most were shown not to be statistically significant and likely due to a posteriori selection where one sees a weird deviation but fails to consider properly how hard one has been looking a deviation with 1:1000 likelihood will typically be found if one tries one thousand times for the deviations that do remain there are no alternative cosmological ideas for instance there seem to be correlations with the ecliptic pole it seems most likely these are due to other effects with the report mentioning uncertainties in the precise beam shape and other possible small remaining instrumental and analysis issues.nthe other confirmation of major significance is of the total amount of matter/energy in the universe in the form of dark energy 72.8 within 1.6 as non particle background and dark matter 22.7 within 1.4 of non baryonic sub atomic particle energy this leaves matter or baryonic particles atoms at only 4.56 within 0.16%.nnnnnnnine-year data releaseeditnn 9-year wmap image of background cosmic radiation 2012.non december 20 2012 the nine-year wmap data and related images were released 700113772000000000013.7720.059 billion-year-old temperature fluctuations and a temperature range of 200 microkelvins are shown in the image in addition the study found that 95 of the early universe is composed of dark matter and dark energy the curvature of space is less than 0.4 percent of flat and the universe emerged from the cosmic dark ages about 400 million years after the big bang.nnnnnnnmain resulteditnnplay media interviews with charles bennett and lyman page about wmap.nthe main result of the mission is contained in the various oval maps of the cmb temperature differences these oval images present the temperature distribution derived by the wmap team from the observations by the telescope during the mission measured is the temperature obtained from a plancks law interpretation of the microwave background the oval map covers the whole sky the results are a snapshot of the universe around 375,000 years after the big bang which happened about 13.8 billion years ago the microwave background is very homogeneous in temperature the relative variations from the mean which presently is still 2.7 kelvins are only of the order of 6995500000000000000510 the temperature variations corresponding to the local directions are presented through different colors the red directions are hotter the blue directions cooler than the average.nnfollow-on missions and future measurementseditnthe original timeline for wmap gave it two years of observations these were completed by september 2003 mission extensions were granted in 2002 2004 2006 and 2008 giving the spacecraft a total of 9 observing years which ended august 2010 and in october 2010 the spacecraft was moved to a heliocentric graveyard orbit outside l2 in which it orbits the sun 14 times every 15 years.nn comparison of cmb results from cobe wmap and planck march 21 2013.nthe planck spacecraft also measured the cmb from 2009 to 2013 and aims to refine the measurements made by wmap both in total intensity and polarization various ground and balloon-based instruments have also made cmb contributions and others are being constructed to do so many are aimed at searching for the b-mode polarization expected from the simplest models of inflation including ebex spider bicep2 keck quiet class sptpol and others.non 21 march 2013 the european-led research team behind the planck cosmology probe released the missions all-sky map of the cosmic microwave background the map suggests the universe is slightly older than previously thought according to the map subtle fluctuations in temperature were imprinted on the deep sky when the cosmos was about 370,000 years old the imprint reflects ripples that arose as early in the existence of the universe as the first nonillionth 10 of a second apparently these ripples gave rise to the present vast cosmic web of galaxy clusters and dark matter based on the 2013 data the universe contains 4.9 ordinary matter 26.8 dark matter and 68.3 dark energy on 5 february 2015 new data was released by the planck mission according to which the age of the universe is 13.799 0.021 billion years old and the hubble constant was measured to be 67.74
