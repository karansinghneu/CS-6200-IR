number density wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnin physics astronomy chemistry biology and geography number density symbol n or is an intensive quantity used to describe the degree of concentration of countable objects particles molecules phonons cells galaxies etc in physical space three-dimensional volumetric number density two-dimensional areal number density or one-dimensional linear number density population density is an example of areal number density the term number concentration symbol c to avoid confusion with amount of substance n is sometimes used in chemistry for the same quantity particularly when comparing with other concentrations.nncontentsnnndefinitioneditnvolume number density is the number of specified objects per unit volume:nnnwhere n is the total number of objects in a volume v nhere it is assumed that n is large enough that rounding of the count to the nearest integer does not introduce much of an error however v is chosen to be small enough that the resulting n does not depend much on the size or shape of the volume v.nnunitseditnin si units number density is measured in m although cm is often used however these units are not quite practical when dealing with atoms or molecules of gases liquids or solids at room temperature and atmospheric pressure because the resulting numbers are extremely large on the order of 10 using the number density of an ideal gas at 0 c and 1 atm as a yardstick n 1 amg 2.686,777,4 10 m is often introduced as a unit of number density for any substances at any conditions not necessarily limited to an ideal gas at 0 c and 1 atm.nnusageeditnusing the number density as a function of spatial coordinates the total number of objects n in the entire volume v can be calculated asnnnwhere dv dx dy dz is a volume element if each object possesses the same mass m the total mass m of all the objects in the volume v can be expressed asnnnsimilar expressions are valid for electric charge or any other extensive quantity associated with countable objects for example replacing m with q total charge and m with q charge of each object in the above equation will lead to a correct expression for charge.nthe number density of solute molecules in a solvent is sometimes called concentration although usually concentration is expressed as a number of moles per unit volume and thus called molar concentration.nnrelation to other quantitieseditnmolar concentrationeditnfor any substance the number density can be expressed in terms of its amount concentration c in mol/m asnnnwhere n is the avogadro constant this is still true if the spatial dimension unit metre in both n and c is consistently replaced by any other spatial dimension unit e.g if n is in cm and c is in mol/cm or if n is in l and c is in mol/l etc.nnmass densityeditnfor atoms or molecules of a well-defined molar mass m in kg/mol the number density can sometimes be expressed in terms of their mass density in kg/m asnnnnote that the ratio m/n is the mass of a single atom or molecule in kg.nnexampleseditnthe following table lists common examples of number densities at 1 atm and 20 c unless otherwise noted.nnnsee alsoeditnnreferences and noteseditnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
