mimas to rheaimages of several moons of saturn from left to right mimas enceladus tethys dione rhea titan in the background iapetus top right and irregularly shaped hyperion bottom right some small moons are also shown all to scale.nthe moons of saturn are numerous and diverse ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous titan which is larger than the planet mercury saturn has 62 moons with confirmed orbits 53 of which have names and only 13 of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers as well as dense rings with complex orbital motions of their own seven saturnian moons are large enough to be ellipsoidal in shape yet only two of those titan and rhea are currently in hydrostatic equilibrium particularly notable among saturns moons are titan the second-largest moon in the solar system after jupiters ganymede with a nitrogen-rich earth-like atmosphere and a landscape featuring dry river networks and hydrocarbon lakes found nowhere else in the solar system and enceladus since its chemical composition is similar to that of comets in particular enceladus emits jets of gas and dust which could indicate the presence of liquid water under its south pole region and may have a global ocean below its surface.ntwenty-four of saturns moons are regular satellites they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to saturns equatorial plane they include the seven major satellites four small moons that exist in a trojan orbit with larger moons two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons that act as shepherds of saturns f ring two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in saturns rings the relatively large hyperion is locked in a resonance with titan the remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the a ring within g ring and between the major moons mimas and enceladus the regular satellites are traditionally named after titans and titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological saturn.nthe remaining 38 with mean diameters ranging from 4 to 213 km are irregular satellites whose orbits are much farther from saturn have high inclinations and are mixed between prograde and retrograde these moons are probably captured minor planets or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured creating collisional families the irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the inuit norse and gallic groups and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies the largest of the irregular moons is phoebe the ninth moon of saturn discovered at the end of the 19th century.nthe rings of saturn are made up of objects ranging in size from microscopic to moonlets hundreds of meters across each in its own orbit around saturn thus a precise number of saturnian moons cannot be given because there is no objective boundary between the countless small anonymous objects that form saturns ring system and the larger objects that have been named as moons over 150 moonlets embedded in the rings have been detected by the disturbance they create in the surrounding ring material though this is thought to be only a small sample of the total population of such objects.nncontentsnnndiscoveryeditn saturn overexposed and the moons iapetus titan dione hyperion and rhea viewed through a 12.5-inch telescopenearly observationseditnbefore the advent of telescopic photography eight moons of saturn were discovered by direct observation using optical telescopes saturns largest moon titan was discovered in 1655 by christiaan huygens using a 57-millimeter 2.2 in objective lens on a refracting telescope of his own design tethys dione rhea and iapetus the sidera lodoicea were discovered between 1671 and 1684 by giovanni domenico cassini mimas and enceladus were discovered in 1789 by william herschel hyperion was discovered in 1848 by w.c bond g.p bond and william lassell.nthe use of long-exposure photographic plates made possible the discovery of additional moons the first to be discovered in this manner phoebe was found in 1899 by w.h pickering in 1966 the tenth satellite of saturn was discovered by audouin dollfus when the rings were observed edge-on near an equinox it was later named janus a few years later it was realized that all observations of 1966 could only be explained if another satellite had been present and that it had an orbit similar to that of janus this object is now known as epimetheus the eleventh moon of saturn it shares the same orbit with janusthe only known example of co-orbitals in the solar system in 1980 three additional saturnian moons were discovered from the ground and later confirmed by the voyager probes they are trojan moons of dione helene and tethys telesto and calypso.nnobservations by

another cassini image rhea bisected in the far-right foreground mimas behind it bright enceladus above and beyond the rings pandora eclipsed by the f ring and janus off to the left.nthe study of the outer planets has since been revolutionized by the use of unmanned space probes the arrival of the voyager spacecraft at saturn in 19801981 resulted in the discovery of three additional moons atlas prometheus and pandora bringing the total to 17 in addition epimetheus was confirmed as distinct from janus in 1990 pan was discovered in archival voyager images.nthe cassini mission which arrived at saturn in the summer of 2004 initially discovered three small inner moons including methone and pallene between mimas and enceladus as well as the second trojan moon of dione polydeuces it also observed three suspected but unconfirmed moons in the f ring in november 2004 cassini scientists announced that the structure of saturns rings indicates the presence of several more moons orbiting within the rings although only one daphnis had been visually confirmed at the time in 2007 anthe was announced in 2008 it was reported that cassini observations of a depletion of energetic electrons in saturns magnetosphere near rhea might be the signature of a tenuous ring system around saturns second largest moon in march 2009 aegaeon a moonlet within the g ring was announced in july of the same year s/2009 s 1 the first moonlet within the b ring was observed in april 2014 the possible beginning of a new moon within the a ring was reported related imagennouter moonseditn quadruple saturnmoon transit captured by the hubble space telescopenstudy of saturns moons has also been aided by advances in telescope instrumentation primarily the introduction of digital charge-coupled devices which replaced photographic plates for the entire 20th century phoebe stood alone among saturns known moons with its highly irregular orbit beginning in 2000 however three dozen additional irregular moons have been discovered using ground-based telescopes a survey starting in late 2000 and conducted using three medium-size telescopes found thirteen new moons orbiting saturn at a great distance in eccentric orbits which are highly inclined to both the equator of saturn and the ecliptic they are probably fragments of larger bodies captured by saturns gravitational pull in 2005 astronomers using the mauna kea observatory announced the discovery of twelve more small outer moons in 2006 astronomers using the subaru 8.2 m telescope reported the discovery of nine more irregular moons in april 2007 tarqeq s/2007 s 1 was announced and in may of the same year s/2007 s 2 and s/2007 s 3 were reported.nsome of the 62 known satellites of saturn are considered lost because they have not been observed since their discovery and hence their orbits are not well-known enough to pinpoint their current locations work has been done to recover many of them in surveys from 2009 onwards but eight s/2007 s 2 s/2004 s 13 s/2006 s 1 s/2007 s 3 s/2004 s 17 s/2004 s 12 s/2004 s 7 and s/2006 s 3 still remain lost today.nn the number of moons known for each of the four outer planets up to july 2018 saturn currently has 62 known satellites.nnamingeditnmain article naming of moonsnthe modern names for saturnian moons were suggested by john herschel in 1847 he proposed to name them after mythological figures associated with the roman titan of time saturn equated to the greek cronus in particular the then known seven satellites were named after titans titanesses and giantsbrothers and sisters of cronus in 1848 lassell proposed that the eighth satellite of saturn be named hyperion after another titan when in the 20th century the names of titans were exhausted the moons were named after different characters of the greco-roman mythology or giants from other mythologies all the irregular moons except phoebe are named after inuit and gallic gods and after norse ice giants.nsome asteroids share the same names as moons of saturn 55 pandora 106 dione 577 rhea 1809 prometheus 1810 epimetheus and 4450 pan in addition two more asteroids previously shared the names of saturnian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the international astronomical union iau calypso and asteroid 53 kalypso and helene and asteroid 101 helena.nnsizeseditn the relative masses of saturns moons mimas the rings and the small moons are invisible at this scale.nsaturns satellite system is very lopsided one moon titan comprises more than 96 of the mass in orbit around the planet the six other planemo ellipsoidal moons constitute roughly 4 of the mass and the remaining 55 small moons together with the rings comprise only 0.04%.nnnorbital groupseditnalthough the boundaries may be somewhat vague saturns moons can be divided into ten groups according to their orbital characteristics many of them such as pan and daphnis orbit within saturns ring system and have orbital periods only slightly longer than the planets rotation period the innermost moons and most regular satellites all have mean orbital inclinations ranging from less than a degree to about 1.5 degrees except iapetus which has an inclination of 7.57 degrees and small orbital eccentricities on the other hand irregular satellites in the outermost regions of saturns moon system in particular the norse group have orbital radii of millions of kilometers and orbital periods lasting several years the moons of the norse group also orbit in the opposite direction to saturns rotation.nnring moonletseditnmain article rings of saturn moonletn daphnis in the keeler gapnduring late july 2009 a moonlet s/2009 s 1 was discovered in the b ring 480 km from the outer edge of the ring by the shadow it cast it is estimated to be 300 m in diameter unlike the a ring moonlets see below it does not induce a propeller feature probably due to the density of the b ring.nn possible beginning of a new moon of saturn imaged on 15 april 2014n saturns f ring along with the moons enceladus and rhea.nin 2006 four tiny moonlets were found in cassini images of the a ring before this discovery only two larger moons had been known within gaps in the a ring pan and daphnis these are large enough to clear continuous gaps in the ring in contrast a moonlet is only massive enough to clear two smallabout 10 km acrosspartial gaps in the immediate vicinity of the moonlet itself creating a structure shaped like an airplane propeller the moonlets themselves are tiny ranging from about 40 to 500 meters in diameter and are too small to be seen directly in 2007 the discovery of 150 more moonlets revealed that they with the exception of two that have been seen outside the encke gap are confined to three narrow bands in the a ring between 126,750 and 132,000 km from saturns center each band is about a thousand kilometers wide which is less than 1 the width of saturns rings this region is relatively free from the disturbances caused by resonances with larger satellites although other areas of the a ring without disturbances are apparently free of moonlets the moonlets were probably formed from the breakup of a larger satellite it is estimated that the a ring contains 7,0008,000 propellers larger than 0.8 km in size and millions larger than 0.25 km.nsimilar moonlets may reside in the f ring there jets of material may be due to collisions initiated by perturbations from the nearby small moon prometheus of these moonlets with the core of the f ring one of the largest f ring moonlets may be the as-yet unconfirmed object s/2004 s 6 the f ring also contains transient fans which are thought to result from even smaller moonlets about 1 km in diameter orbiting near the f ring core.none of the recently discovered moons aegaeon resides within the bright arc of g ring and is trapped in the 7:6 mean-motion resonance with mimas this means that it makes exactly seven revolutions around saturn while mimas makes exactly six the moon is the largest among the population of bodies that are sources of dust in this ring.nin april 2014 nasa scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the a ring.nnring shepherdseditnmain article rings of saturnn shepherd satellites atlas daphnis and pan color.nshepherd satellites are small moons that orbit within or just beyond a planets ring system they have the effect of sculpting the rings giving them sharp edges and creating gaps between them saturns shepherd moons are pan encke gap daphnis keeler gap atlas a ring prometheus f ring and pandora f ring these moons together with co-orbitals see below probably formed as a result of accretion of the friable ring material on preexisting denser cores the cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.nnco-orbitalseditnmain article co-orbital moonnjanus and epimetheus are called co-orbital moons they are of roughly equal size with janus being slightly larger than epimetheus janus and epimetheus have orbits with only a few kilometers difference in semi-major axis close enough that they would collide if they attempted to pass each other instead of colliding however their gravitational interaction causes them to swap orbits every four years.nninner large moonseditn tiger stripes on enceladusnsaturns rings and moonstethys hyperion and prometheustethys and janustethys and the rings of saturnnthe innermost large moons of saturn orbit

and enceladus methone anthe and pallene named after the alkyonides of greek mythology they are some of the smallest moons in the saturn system anthe and methone have very faint ring arcs along their orbits whereas pallene has a faint complete ring of these three moons only methone has been photographed at close range showing it to be egg-shaped with very few or no craters.nntrojan moonseditnmain article trojan moonntrojan moons are a unique feature only known from the saturnian system a trojan body orbits at either the leading l or trailing l lagrange point of a much larger object such as a large moon or planet tethys has two trojan moons telesto leading and calypso trailing and dione also has two helene leading and polydeuces trailing helene is by far the largest trojan moon while polydeuces is the smallest and has the most chaotic orbit these moons are coated with dusty material that has smoothed out their surfaces.nnouter large moonseditnthese moons all orbit beyond the e

eccentricity of the orbits is shown by the segments extending from the pericenter to apocenter the satellites with positive inclinations are prograde those with negative are retrograde the x-axis is labeled in km the prograde inuit and gallic groups and the retrograde norse group are identified.nirregular moons are small satellites with large-radii inclined and frequently retrograde orbits believed to have been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process they often occur as collisional families or groups the precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope although the latter is usually assumed to be quite lowaround 6 albedo of phoebe or less the irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by water absorption bands they are neutral or moderately red in colorsimilar to c-type p-type or d-type asteroids though they are much less red than kuiper belt objects.nninuit groupeditnmain article saturns inuit group of satellitesnthe inuit group includes five prograde outer moons that are similar enough in their distances from the planet

saturnian moons are listed here by orbital period or semi-major axis from shortest to longest moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold while the irregular moons are listed in red orange and gray background.nnnnnunconfirmed moonseditnthe following objects observed by cassini have not been confirmed as solid bodies it is not yet clear if these are real satellites or merely persistent clumps within the f ring.nnnhypothetical moonseditntwo moons were claimed to be discovered by different astronomers but never seen again both moons were said to orbit between titan and hyperion.nnnformationeditnit is thought that the saturnian system of titan mid-sized moons and rings developed from a set-up closer to the galilean moons of jupiter though the details are unclear it has been proposed either that a second titan-sized moon broke up producing the rings and inner mid-sized moons or that two large moons fused to form titan with the collision scattering icy debris that formed the mid-sized moons on june 23 2014 nasa claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of titan came from materials in the oort cloud associated with comets and not from the materials that formed saturn in earlier times studies based on enceladuss tidal-based geologic activity and the lack of evidence of extensive past resonances in tethys dione and rheas orbits suggest that the moons inward of titan may be only 100 million years old.nnnoteseditnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
