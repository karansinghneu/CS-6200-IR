disambiguation.n nubian pharaohs of the 25th dynastyn map of ancient egypt with nubian desert markednnubia nubi nju is a region along the nile river encompassing the area between aswan in southern egypt and khartoum in central sudan it was the seat of one of the earliest civilizations of ancient africa with a history that can be traced from at least 2500 bc onward with the kerma culture the latter was conquered by the new kingdom of egypt under pharaoh thutmose i around 1500 bc nubia was home to several empires most prominently the kingdom of kush which conquered egypt during the 8th century bc during the reign of piye and ruled the country as its twenty-fifth dynasty to be replaced a century later by the native egyptian twenty-sixth dynasty nthe collapse of kush in the 4th century ad after more than a thousand years of existence was precipitated by an invasion by ethiopias kingdom of aksum and saw the rise of three christian kingdoms nobatia makuria and alodia the last two again lasting for roughly a millennium their eventual decline initiated not only the partition of nubia into the northern half conquered by the ottomans and the southern half by the sennar sultanate in the 16th century but also a rapid islamization and partial arabization of the nubian people nubia was again united with the khedivate of egypt in the 19th century today the region of nubia is split between egypt and sudan.nthe primarily archaeological science dealing with ancient nubia is called nubiology.nncontentsnnnlinguisticseditnmain article nubian languagesnthe name nubia is derived from that of the noba people nomads who settled the area in the 4th century ce following the collapse of the kingdom of mero the noba spoke a nilo-saharan language ancestral to old nubian old nubian was mostly used in religious texts dating from the 8th and 15th centuries before the 4th century and throughout classical antiquity nubia was known as kush or in classical greek usage included under the name ethiopia aithiopia.nhistorically the people of nubia spoke at least two varieties of the nubian language group a subfamily that includes nobiin the descendant of old nubian kenuzi-dongola midob and several related varieties in the northern part of the nuba mountains in south kordofan until at least 1970 the birgid language was spoken north of nyala in darfur but is now extinct however linguistic evidence indicates that the languages spoken in the ancient kerma culture present-day southern egypt and northern sudan in nubia belonged to the cushitic branch of the afroasiatic languages.nngeographyeditnsee also aethiopia archaeological expeditions to nubia and nile boatnnubia was divided into three major regions upper middle and lower nubia in reference to their locations along the nile lower refers to regions downstream and upper refers to regions upstream lower nubia lies between the first and the second cataracts within the current borders of egypt middle nubia lies between the second and the third cataracts upper nubia lies south of the third cataract.nnhistoryeditnprehistoryeditn tools weapons and adornments from el-barga 60005500 bcnearly settlements sprouted in both upper and lower nubia egyptians referred to nubia as ta-seti or the land of the bow since the nubians were known to be expert archers modern scholars typically refer to the people from this area as the a-group culture fertile farmland just south of the third cataract is known as the pre-kerma culture in upper nubia as they are the ancestors.nthe neolithic people in the nile valley likely came from sudan as well as the sahara and there was shared culture with the two areas and with that of egypt during this period by the 5th millennium bc the people who inhabited what is now called nubia participated in the neolithic revolution saharan rock reliefs depict scenes that have been thought to be suggestive of a cattle cult typical of those seen throughout parts of eastern africa and the nile valley even to this day megaliths discovered at nabta playa are early examples of what seems to be one of the worlds first astronomical devices predating stonehenge by almost 2,000 years this complexity as observed at nabta playa and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there likely formed the basis for the structure of both the neolithic society at nabta and the old kingdom of egypt around 3500 bc the second nubian culture termed the a-group arose it was a contemporary of and ethnically and culturally very similar to the polities in predynastic naqada of upper egypt the a-group people were engaged in trade with the egyptians this trade is testified archaeologically by large amounts of egyptian commodities deposited in the graves of the a-group people the imports consisted of gold objects copper tools faience amulets and beads seals slate palettes stone vessels and a variety of pots.nn nubian terracotta female figurine from the neolithic period ca 35003100 b.c.e brooklyn museumnaround 3300 bc there is evidence of a unified kingdom as shown by the finds at qustul that maintained substantial interactions both cultural and genetic with the culture of naqadan upper egypt the nubian culture may have even contributed to the unification of the nile valley.ntoby wilkinson based on work by bruce williams in the 1980s wrote that the white crown associated in historic times with upper egypt is first attested later than the red crown but is directly associated with the ruler somewhat earlier the earliest known depiction of the white crown is on a ceremonial incense burner from cemetery at qustul in lower nubia based on a 1998 excavation report jane roy has written that at the time of williams argument the qustul cemetery and the royal iconography found there was dated to the naqada iiia period thus antedating royal cemeteries in egypt of the naqada iiib phase new evidence from abydos however particularly the excavation of cemetery u and the tome u-j dating to naqada iiia has shown that this iconography appears earlier in egypt."nn pottery of the nubian a-group musee du louvrenaround the turn of the protodynastic period naqada in its bid to conquer and unify the whole nile valley seems to have conquered ta-seti the kingdom where qustul was located and harmonized it with the egyptian state thus nubia became the first nome of upper egypt at the time of the first dynasty the a-group area seems to have been entirely depopulated most likely due to immigration to areas west and south.nthis culture began to decline in the early 28th century bc george reisner suggested that it was succeeded by a culture that he called the b-group but most archaeologists today believe that this culture never existed and that the area was depopulated from c 3000 bc to c 2500 when a-group descendants returned to the area the causes of this are uncertain but it was perhaps caused by egyptian invasions and pillaging that began at this time nubia is believed to have served as a trade corridor between egypt and tropical africa long before 3100 bc egyptian craftsmen of the period used ivory and ebony wood from tropical africa which came through nubia.nin 2300 bc nubia was first mentioned in old kingdom egyptian accounts of trade missions from aswan right above the first cataract the southern limit of egyptian control at the time egyptians imported gold incense ebony copper ivory and exotic animals from tropical africa through nubia as trade between egypt and nubia increased so did wealth and stability by the egyptian 6th dynasty nubia was divided into a series of small kingdoms there is debate over whether these c-group peoples who flourished from c 2500 bc to c 1500 bc were another internal evolution or invaders there are definite similarities between the pottery of the a-group and c-group so it may be a return of the ousted group-as or an internal revival of lost arts at this time the sahara desert was becoming too arid to support human beings and it is possible that there was a sudden influx of saharan nomads c-group pottery is characterized by all-over incised geometric lines with white infill and impressed imitations of basketry.nduring the egyptian middle kingdom c 20401640 bc egypt began expanding into nubia to gain more control over the trade routes in northern nubia and direct access to trade with southern nubia they erected a chain of forts down the nile below the second cataract these garrisons seemed to have peaceful relations with the local nubian people but little interaction during the period a contemporaneous but distinct culture from the c-group was the pan grave culture so called because of their shallow graves the pan graves are associated with the east bank of the nile but the pan graves and c-group definitely interacted their pottery is characterized by incised lines of a more limited character than those of the c-group generally having interspersed undecorated spaces within the geometric schemes.nnnubia and ancient egypteditnnone interpretation is that nubian a-group rulers and early egyptian pharaohs used related royal symbols similarities in rock art of a-group nubia and upper egypt support this position ancient egypt conquered nubian territory in various eras and incorporated parts of the area into its provinces the nubians in turn were to conquer egypt under its 25th dynasty.nhowever relations between the two peoples also show peaceful cultural interchange and cooperation including mixed marriages the medjay mj3 represents the name ancient egypt gave to a region in northern sudan where an ancient people of nubia inhabited they became part of the egyptian military as scouts and minor workers.nduring the middle kingdom of egypt medjay no longer referred to the district of medja but to a tribe or clan of people it is not known what happened to the district but after the first intermediate period of egypt it and other districts in nubia were no longer mentioned in the written record written accounts detail the medjay as nomadic desert people over time they were incorporated into the egyptian army in the army the medjay served as garrison troops in egyptian fortifications in nubia and patrolled the deserts as a kind of gendarmerie this was done in the hope of preventing their fellow medjay tribespeople from further attacking egyptian assets in the region later they were even used during kamoses campaign against the hyksos and became instrumental in making the egyptian state into a military power.nby the eighteenth dynasty of the new kingdom period the medjay were an elite paramilitary police force no longer did the term refer to an ethnic group and over time the new meaning became synonymous with the policing occupation in general being an elite police force the medjay were often used to protect valuable areas especially royal and religious complexes though they are most notable for their protection of the royal palaces and tombs in thebes and the surrounding areas the medjay were known to have been used throughout upper and lower egypt.nn ramesses ii holding a crook and a flail nubia 19th dynasty c 1240 bc state museum of egyptian art munichnvarious pharaohs of nubian origin are held by some egyptologists to have played an important part towards the area in different eras of egyptian history particularly the 12th dynasty these rulers handled matters in typical egyptian fashion reflecting the close cultural influences between the two regions.nnthe xiith dynasty 19911786 b.c.e originated from the aswan region as expected strong nubian features and dark coloring are seen in their sculpture and relief work this dynasty ranks as among the greatest whose fame far outlived its actual tenure on the throne especially interesting it was a member of this dynasty that decreed that no nehsy riverine nubian of the principality of kush except such as came for trade or diplomatic reasons should pass by the egyptian fortress and cops at the southern end of the second nile cataract why would this royal family of nubian ancestry ban other nubians from coming into egyptian territory because the egyptian rulers of nubian ancestry had become egyptians culturally as pharaohs they exhibited typical egyptian attitudes and adopted typical egyptian policies yurco 1989 nnin the new kingdom nubians became indistinguishable in the archaeological record from egyptians.nnit is an extremely difficult task to attempt to describe the nubians during the course of egypts new kingdom because their presence appears to have virtually evaporated from the archaeological record the result has been described as a wholesale nubian assimilation into egyptian society this assimilation was so complete that it masked all nubian ethnic identities insofar as archaeological remains are concerned beneath the impenetrable veneer of egypts material culture in the kushite period when nubians ruled as pharaohs in their own right the material culture of dynasty xxv about 750655 b.c.e was decidedly egyptian in character nubias entire landscape up to the region of the third cataract was dotted with temples indistinguishable in style and decoration from contemporary temples erected in egypt the same observation obtains for the smaller number of typically egyptian tombs in which these elite nubian princes were interred.nnkermaeditnmain article kerma culturen kerma citynfrom the pre-kerma culture the first kingdom to unify much of the region arose the kerma culture named for its presumed capital at kerma was one of the earliest urban centers in the nile region and spoke languages of the cushitic branch by 1750 bc the kings of kerma were powerful enough to organize the labor for monumental walls and structures of mud brick they also had rich tombs with possessions for the afterlife and large human sacrifices george andrew reisner excavated sites at kerma and found distinctive nubian architecture such as large tombs and palace-like structures at one point kerma came very close to conquering egypt egypt suffered a serious defeat at the hands of the kingdom of kush.nn the turin papyrus mapnaccording to davies head of the joint british museum and egyptian archaeological team the attack was so devastating that if the kerma forces had chosen to stay and occupy egypt they might have eliminated it for good and brought the nation to extinction when egyptian power revived under the new kingdom of egypt c 15321070 bc egyptians began to expand further southwards the egyptians destroyed kermas kingdom and capitol and expanded the egyptian empire to the fourth cataract.nby the end of the reign of thutmose i 1520 bc all of northern nubia had been annexed the egyptians built a new administrative center at napata and used the area to produce gold and incense the nubian gold production made egypt a prime source of the precious metal in the middle east the primitive working conditions for the slaves are recorded by diodorus siculus who saw some of the mines at a later time one of the oldest maps known is of a gold mine in nubia the turin papyrus map dating to about 1160 bc this map is also one of the earliest characterized road maps in existence.nnkusheditnmain article kingdom of kushnnapatan periodeditn

indigenous customs forming the kingdom of kush archaeologists have found several burials in the area that seem to belong to local leaders the kushites were buried there soon after the egyptians decolonized the nubian frontier kush adopted many egyptian practices such as their religion the kingdom of kush survived longer than that of egypt invaded egypt under the leadership of king piye and controlled egypt during the 8th century bc as the twenty-fifth dynasty of egypt.nthe kushites held sway over their northern neighbors for nearly 100 years until they were eventually repelled by the invading assyrians the assyrians forced them to move farther south where they eventually established their capital at mero of the nubian kings of this era taharqa is perhaps the best known a son and the third successor of the founding pharaoh piye he was crowned in memphis egypt c 690 taharqa ruled over both nubia and egypt restored egyptian temples at karnak and built new temples and pyramids in

defeated nubians according to strabo following the kushite advance gaius petronius a prefect of egypt at the time prepared a large army and marched south the roman forces clashed with the kushite armies near thebes and forced them to retreat to pselchis maharraqa in kushite lands petronius then sent deputies to the kushites in an attempt to reach a peace agreement and make certain demands.nquoting strabo the kushites desired three days for consideration in order to make a final decision however after the three days kush did not respond and petronius advanced with his armies and took the kushite city of premnis modern karanog south of maharraqa from there he advanced all the way south to napata the second capital in kush after meroe petronius attacked and sacked napata causing the son of the kushite queen to flee strabo describes the defeat of the kushites at napata stating that he petronius made prisoners of the inhabitants".nduring this time the different parts of the region divided into smaller groups with individual leaders or generals each commanding small armies of mercenaries they fought for control of what is now nubia and its surrounding territories leaving the entire region weak and vulnerable to attack mero would eventually meet defeat by the new rising kingdom of aksum to their south under king ezana.nthe classification of the meroitic language is uncertain it was long assumed to have been one of the afroasiatic languages like the egyptian language but is now considered to have likely been one of the eastern sudanic languages.nat some point during the 4th century the region was conquered by the noba from which the name nubia may derive another possibility is that it comes from the egyptian word for gold from then on the romans referred to the area as nobatia.nnchristian nubiaeditnmain articles makuria nobadia and alodian a church mural depicting an elaborate cross faras 12th centurynaround ad 350 the area was invaded by the

bishop of philae before his death in 373 showing that christianity had penetrated the region by the 4th century john of ephesus records that a monophysite priest named julian converted the king and his nobles of nobatia around 545 john of ephesus also writes that the kingdom of alodia was converted around 569 however john of biclarum records that the kingdom of makuria was converted to catholicism the same year suggesting that john of ephesus might be mistaken further doubt is cast on johns testimony by an entry in the chronicle of the greek orthodox patriarch of alexandria eutychius which states that in 719 the church of nubia transferred its allegiance from the greek to the coptic orthodox church.nby the 7th century makuria expanded becoming the dominant power in the region it was strong enough to halt the southern expansion of islam after the arabs had taken egypt after several failed invasions the new rulers agreed to a treaty with dongola called baqt allowing for peaceful coexistence and trade this treaty held for six hundred years over time the influx of arab traders introduced islam to nubia and it gradually supplanted christianity while there are records of a bishop at qasr ibrim in 1372 his see had come to include that located at faras it is also clear that the cathedral of dongola had been converted to a mosque in 1317.nthe influx of arabs and nubians to egypt and sudan had contributed to the suppression of the nubian identity following the collapse of the last nubian kingdom around 1504 a vast majority of the nubian population is currently muslim and the arabic language is their main medium of communication in addition to their indigenous old nubian language the unique characteristic of nubian is shown in their culture dress
