of canoe featuring one or more lateral support floats known as outriggers which are fastened to one or both sides of the main hull smaller canoes often employ a single outrigger on the port side while larger canoes may employ a single-outrigger double-outrigger or double-hull configuration see also catamaran the sailing canoes are an important part of the austronesian heritage they are also very popular in puerto rico.nunlike a single-hulled canoe an outrigger or double-hull canoe generates stability as a result of the distance between its hulls rather than due to the shape of each individual hull as such the hulls of outrigger or double-hull canoes are typically longer narrower and more hydrodynamically efficient than those of single-hull canoes compared to other types of canoes outrigger canoes can be quite fast yet are also capable of being paddled and sailed in rougher water this paddling technique however differs greatly from kayaking or rowing the paddle or blade used by the paddler is single sided with either a straight or a double-bend shaft nncontentsnnnhistoryeditn 17th-century depiction of a visayan karakoa a very large double-outrigger warshipnoutrigger canoes were originally developed by the austronesian-speaking peoples of the islands of southeast asia for sea travel they were used to transport these peoples both eastward to polynesia and new zealand and westward across the indian ocean as far as madagascar during the austronesian migration period the austronesian peoples malagasy maritime southeast asian micronesian melanesian native taiwanese and polynesian peoples continue to be the primary users of the outrigger canoes.nn succession of forms in the development of the austronesian boat mahdi 1999nearly researchers like heine-geldern 1932 and hornell 1943 once believed that catamarans evolved from outrigger canoes but modern authors specializing in austronesian cultures like doran 1981 and mahdi 1988 now believe it to be the opposite.ntwo canoes bound together developed directly from minimal raft technologies of two logs tied together over time the double-hulled canoe form developed into the asymmetric double canoe where one hull is smaller than the other eventually the smaller hull became the prototype outrigger giving way to the single outrigger canoe then to the reversible single outrigger canoe finally the single outrigger types developed into the double outrigger canoe or trimarans.nthis would also explain why older austronesian populations in island southeast asia madagascar and the comoros tend to favor double outrigger canoes as it keeps the boats stable when tacking but they still have small regions where catamarans and single-outrigger canoes are still used in contrast more distant outlying descendant populations in micronesia and polynesia retained the double-hull and the single outrigger canoe types but the technology for double outriggers never reached them although it exists in western melanesia to deal with the problem of the instability of the boat when the outrigger faces leeward when tacking they instead developed the shunting technique in sailing in conjunction with reversible single-outriggers.nn a traditional lakana from madagascarnwhen magellans ships first encountered the chamorros of the mariana islands in 1521 antonio pigafetta recorded that the chamorros sailboats far surpassed magellans in speed and maneuverability similarly the spanish priest francisco combs describing the large karakoa outrigger warships of the visayan islands in the philippines remarked:nn"that care and attention which govern their boat-building cause their ships to sail like birds while ours are like lead in this regard francisco combs historia de las islas de mindanao iolo

lanka where they are known as oruwa as well as among some groups in the andaman and nicobar islands they can also be found in east africa e.g the ungalawa of tanzania.nn the traditional ppao of tonganthe acquisition of the catamaran and outrigger canoe technology by the non-austronesian peoples in sri lanka and southern india is the result of very early austronesian colonization of the region including the maldives and laccadive islands that have since been assimilated its estimated to have occurred around 1000 to 600 bce and onwards this is still evident in sri lankan and south indian languages for example tamil paavu telugu paava and kannada paahu all meaning ship are all derived from protohesperonesian padaw sailboat with austronesian cognates like javanese perahu kadazan padau maranao padaw cebuano parw samoan folau hawaiian halau and maori wharau genetic studies on maldivians have also identified austronesian admixture similarly the outrigger canoe technology of east africa was acquired through contact with the austronesian settlers of madagascar and the comoros islands.nthe technology has persisted into the modern age outrigger canoes can be quite large fishing or transport vessels in the philippines outrigger canoes called bangka or paraw are often fitted with petrol engines the links between seafaring and outrigger canoes in the philippines extend through to political life in which the smallest political unit in the country is still called barangay after the historical balangay outrigger boats used in the original migrations of the first austronesian peoples across the archipelago and beyond the polynesian voyaging society has two double-hull sailing canoes hokulea and hawaiiloa and sails them between various islands in the pacific using traditional polynesian navigation methods without instruments the hikianalia and alingano maisu are other extant double-hulled voyaging canoes.nn hawaiiloa a double-hull catamaran sailing canoe built

proto-philippine katir.nntypeseditndouble-outrigger canoes are more prevalent in southeast asia and madagascar they have two outrigger floats connected to spars lashed across a single hull they range in size from small vessels like the jukung vinta and the paraw to medium-sized trading and fishing vessels like the balangay and basnigan to very large warships like the karakoa and kora kora in philippine vessels additional booms called batangan are usually added across the outrigger spars tadik in between the outrigger floats katig and the main hull bangka in modern terminology especially in leisure or sport boating double-outrigger ships are usually termed trimaran or triple-hull ships.nsingle-outrigger canoes are more prevalent in polynesia and micronesia single-outrigger canoes have a single outrigger float ama connected to the main hull by spars called iako hawaiian iato tahitian or kiato mori the ama which is usually rigged on the left side provides stability the paddlers need to be careful to avoid leaning too far on the opposite side of the ama as that may cause the canoe to capsize huli or lumai a variant of single-outrigger canoes with two equal-sized hulls instead of a hull and an outrigger float is called catamaran or double-hull ships.nnmodern sporteditnnn a six-person outrigger canoenoutrigger canoe racing has become a popular canoeing sport with numerous clubs located around the world outrigger canoe racing is the state sport of hawaii and an interscholastic high school sport in hawaii entire families participate in summer regattas with age groups from keiki children as young as 6 with an adult steersperson and age 12 through age 60+.nmajor races in hawaii include the molokai hoe 43 mi 69 km mens race from the island of molokai to oahu across the kaiwi channel na wahine o ke kai same race for women and the queen liliuokalani race held near kona on the island of hawai.nin modern sport outrigger canoeing ships are classified according to the configuration and number of the hulls and the number of paddlers including the oc1 oc2 oc3 oc4 and oc6 with the respective number of paddlers using a single-hull outrigger canoe and the dc12 or oc12 with twelve paddlers using a double-hull outrigger canoe two six-person canoes rigged together like a catamaran outriggers without a rudder are referred to as v1 v2 etc where v refers to vaa.nsix-person outrigger canoes or oc6 are among the most commonly used for sport use single-person outrigger canoes or oc1 are also very common two and four-person outrigger canoes are also sometimes used and two six-person outrigger canoes are sometimes rigged together like a catamaran to form a twelve-person double canoe.nn racing outrigger canoes the canoe in the front right with a narrower hull and smaller body is a single-person outrigger canoe or oc1 the other canoes are six-person outrigger canoes or oc6.nmodern oc6 hulls and amas are commonly made from glass-reinforced plastic however some canoes are made of more traditional materials in ancient hawaii canoes were carved from the trunks of very old koa trees these canoes although rare are still very much in use today the iako are usually made of wood the iako-ama and iako-hull connections are typically done with rope wrapped and tied in an interlocking fashion to reduce the risk of the connection coming completely apart if the rope breaks.nmodern oc1 hulls and amas are commonly made from glass-reinforced plastic carbon fiber reinforced plastic and/or kevlar to produce a strong but light canoe oc1 are often made with rudders operated by foot pedals more traditional designs do not have rudders oc1 commonly use iako made of aluminium with a mechanism for quickly assembling and disassembling the canoe snap buttons large wing nuts etc..nnroleseditnin an outrigger canoe the paddlers sit in line facing toward the bow of the canoe i.e forward in the direction of travel unlike rowing the seats are numbered from 1 closest to the bow to the number of seats in the canoe usually 6 the steerer or steersman or steersperson sits in the last seat of the canoe seat 6 in the common oc6 and as the name indicates is primarily responsible for steering the paddler sitting in seat 1 is called the stroke or stroker and is responsible for setting the pace of the paddle strokes the stroker should have a high level of endurance to keep the rate the number of strokes taken in a given amount of time manageable for whatever the situation may be the first two positions may also be involved in certain steering manoeuvers this usually involves the draw stroke during a tight turn the one seat might poke to make the canoe turn the opposite way in the middle of the canoe seats number 3 and 4 known as the powerhouse are the strong and powerful paddlers any of the 2 can be the caller who directs when to switch over their blades when to pick up or slow down the stroking pace etc whoever is caller must have very good leadership skills and know how to think off the top of their heads in any situation every position has an important role to play in the canoe.nin an oc1 the single paddler must also steer the canoe some oc1s have rudders operated by foot pedals while oc1s without rudders must be steered by drawing and paddling as needed for steering purposes while paddling to move the canoe forward.nnsteersmaneditna good steersman is able to maintain the straight attitude of the canoe throughout the course of a race and also keep the boat and the crew safe in rough sea conditions s/he may also take advantage of water conditions to gain extra speed by surfing the steersman uses a single bladed steering paddle which has a larger blade than a standard outrigger paddle is built stronger and has less or no bend in its shaft s/he steers by the following methods:nnna steersman also skippers the canoe and instructs all other paddlers as necessary as an outrigger canoe is a long narrow canoe with the steersman placed at the very end the steersman must give instructions sufficiently loudly and clearly for the entire crew to hear from a water safety perspective the steersman should also be among the most experienced crew members and be knowledgeable with the waterways and weather conditions relevant maritime rules and other safety considerations such as the use of personal flotation devices rigging of the canoe placement of paddlers in the various seating positions and recovery from a huli by righting the canoe and bailing out the water the steersman should also be able to keep the ama down during rough water.nnpaddlerseditn 1907 paddler from new guineanpaddlers use single-bladed paddles usually with single or double bent shafts the paddling stroke is similar to that of most other racing canoe paddling strokes involving primarily core and lat strength generally each paddler paddles on the opposite side from the paddler in directly front for example in an oc6 paddlers in seats 1 3 and 5 paddle on one side while paddlers in seats 2 and 4 paddle on the other side all paddlers switch sides simultaneously on a call from one who is the designated caller the steerer may paddle either side or switch sides as needed for steering purposes the steersman will also switch sides to keep the ama from popping up and capsizing the canoe.nstronger paddlers are typically placed in the middle of the canoe while paddlers with the most endurance tend to be placed at the front as the lead paddler sets the pace for the crew all other paddlers synchronize their strokes to the paddler in front of them whom they can directly see.nin rough water it is often desirable to have a paddler with steering skill in seat 5 of an oc6 to allow for the steerer to have that paddler also take steering strokes if needed in some situations in conditions when the boat is surfing the stern of the canoe will be so far out of the water that seat 5 will have to keep the boat on course a seat 5 paddler with steering skill can also assist in preventing a huli by staying on the ama side during a particularly rough stretch of water.nin water rough enough to splash into the canoe paddlers also need to pay attention to the water level in the canoe report the situation to the steerer and bail out the water as necessary paddlers also need to know how to recover from a huli under the steerers direction.nin a quick turn situation paddlers at the front may also be instructed to une poke steer causes the canoe to turn the opposite direction or kahi post and draw steer pulls the canoe to the side where this is done to help bring the canoe around a turn quickly.nnracingeditn hawaiki nui vaa i race in french polynesianthe length of a race ranges from short sprints e.g 250500 metres for the oc1 and the oc12 5002000 metres usually includes turns for the oc6 to longer events including marathons e.g 42 kilometres a number of races are raced over distances that far exceed 42 kilometres including the molokai hoe that crosses the kaiwi channel between the islands of molokai and oahu in hawaii however long-distance races of 20 to 30 kilometres are more common with shorter 5 to 8 kilometre courses typically being offered to novice paddlers and those under 20 years of age.nlonger races involving the oc6 often involve paddler replacements which involve exit and entry to the canoe directly from the water while the canoe is underway this is called a water change typically nine paddlers form a crew with six paddling the oc6 and the other three resting drinking and/or eating on an escort boat replacement typically occurs at 20 to 30 minute intervals the escort boat drops the relief paddlers into the water ahead of the oc6 which is steered toward them the relief paddlers climb in on the ama side as those they are replacing roll out into the water on the opposite side the escort boat then picks up the paddlers in the water so that they can rest drink and/or eat before they in turn relieve some of the paddlers in the oc6.nn outrigger canoe racing in hudson river new yorknthe longer races are typically conducted in the open ocean e.g between islands in the south pacific the molokai hoe in hawaii the hamilton cup in australia the vaka eiva in rarotonga cook islands the motu2motu in aitutaki cook islands and the catalina channel crossing in california are four examples of races involving water changes.npaddlers and crews are usually classified by gender and age gender classification is typically straightforward with male female and coed classifications with the latter being a crew with equal numbers of male and female paddlers different rules may apply to nine-person coed crews doing a race with paddler replacements age classifications typically include youth divisions like 19-and-under 16-and-under etc master divisions with minimum ages typically starting at 35 or 40 years of age and an open division which allows paddlers of any age a novice division for paddlers with less than a specified number of years of race experience usually one or two may also exist in a given association.nin some races a particular type of outrigger canoe usually a more traditional design for the region may be given its own racing classification for example races in hawaii have a koa division while southern california has a bradley oc6 division and northern california oc1 sprint races have a traditional no rudder division.nthere are several outrigger racing organizations in the united states they include the east coast outrigger racing association ecora the hawaiian canoe racing association hcra the northern california outrigger canoe association ncoca the southern california outrigger canoe association scora and several more.nnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnfurther readingeditnnexternal linkseditnnnrace linksnnnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
