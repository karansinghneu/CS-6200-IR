glaciers locking up vast amounts of water exposed a wide stretch of the sea floor both at the present strait and in the shallow sea north and south of it this view of how paleo-indians entered america

nearly became a reality in 1864 when a russian-american telegraph company began preparations for an overland telegraph line connecting europe and america via the east it was abandoned when the undersea atlantic cable proved successful.na further proposal for a bridge-and-tunnel link from siberia to alaska was made by french engineer baron loicq de lobel in 1906 czar nicholas ii of russia issued an order authorising a franco-american syndicate represented by de lobel to begin work on the trans-siberian alaska railroad project but no physical work ever commenced.nsuggestions have been made to construct a bering strait bridge between alaska and siberia however despite the unprecedented engineering political and financial challenges russia green-lighted the us 65-billion tkm-world link tunnel project in august 2011 if completed the 103 km 64 mile project would have been the worlds longest china considered construction of a china-russia-canada-america railroad line that would include construction of a 200 km 120 mi long underwater tunnel that would cross the bering strait.nnproposed dameditnin 1956 the soviet union proposed to the us a joint bi-national project to warm the arctic ocean and melt some of the ice cap as designed by petr borisov the soviet project called for a 90 km 56 mi wide dam across the bering strait it would block the cold pacific current from entering the arctic by pumping low-salinity cold surface water across the dam to the pacific warmer and higher salinity sea water from the atlantic ocean would be introduced into the arctic ocean however citing national security concerns the cia and fbi experts opposed the soviet plan by arguing that while the plan was feasible it would compromise norad and thus the dam could be built at only an immense cost soviet scientist d a drogaytsev also opposed the idea stating that the sea north of the dam and north-flowing rivers in siberia would become unnavigable year round and extend the gobi and other deserts to the northern siberia coastline.namerican charles p steinmetz earlier proposed to widen the bering strait by removing st lawrence island and parts of seward and chukotski peninsulas a strait 200 miles wide would let the japan current melt the arctic ocean.nin the 21st century another dam has also been proposed however the aim of the proposal is to preserve the arctic ice cap against global warming.nn"ice curtain bordereditn little diomede island us left and big diomede island russia rightnduring the cold war the bering strait marked the border between the soviet
