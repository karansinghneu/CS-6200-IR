diffuse sky radiation wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn"red sky redirects here for other uses see red sky disambiguation.nnn a spectrum taken of blue sky clearly shows solar fraunhofer lines and the atmospheric water absorption band.ndiffuse sky radiation is solar radiation reaching the earths surface after having been scattered from the direct solar beam by molecules or particulates in the atmosphere also called sky radiation diffuse skylight or just skylight it is the reason for the color changes of the sky of the total light removed from the direct solar beam by scattering in the atmosphere approximately 25 of the incident radiation when and where the sun is high in the sky depending on the amount of dust haze and other particulates in the atmosphere about two-thirds ultimately reaches the earth as diffuse sky radiation when the sun is at the zenith in a cloudless sky with 1361 w/m above the atmosphere direct sunlight is about 1050 w/m and total insolation about 1120 w/m this implies that under these conditions the diffuse radiation is only about 70 w/m out of the original 1361 w/m.nthe dominant radiative scattering processes in the atmosphere rayleigh scattering and mie scattering are elastic in nature by which light can be deviated from its path without being absorbed and with no change in wavelength.nncontentsnnncoloreditn clear blue skyn comparison of the scattering efficiency of blue light in the atmosphere compared to red light.nthe sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short-wavelength light more than longer wavelengths since blue light is at the short-wavelength end of the visible spectrum it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long-wavelength red light the result is that when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun the human eye perceives them to be blue the color perceived is similar to that obtained by a monochromatic blue of a wavelength of 474476 nm mixed with white light i.e an unsaturated blue light the explanation of the blue color by rayleigh in 1871 is one of the most famous examples of the application of dimensional analysis in solving a problem in physics.nnear sunrise and sunset most of the sunlight arrives nearly tangentially to the earths surface thus the lights path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out along the way leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red therefore when looking at the sunset and sunrise we see the color red more than the other colors.nscattering and absorption are major causes of the attenuation of radiation by the atmosphere scattering varies as a function of the ratio of the particle diameter to the wavelength of the radiation when this ratio is less than about one-tenth rayleigh scattering occurs in this case the scattering coefficient varies inversely with the fourth power of the wavelength at larger ratios scattering varies in a complex fashion described for spherical particles by the mie theory the laws of geometric optics begin to apply at a ratio of the order of 10.nin the example of the sky at the zenith it is blue during broad daylight due to rayleigh scattering involving diatomic gases n o near sunset and especially during twilight ozone o absorption significantly contributes to maintaining the skys blue color.nnneutral pointseditnthere are four commonly detectable points of zero polarization of diffuse sky radiation known as neutral points lying along the vertical circle through the sun.nnnunder an overcast skyeditnthere is essentially no direct sunlight under an overcast sky so all light is then diffuse sky radiation the flux of light is not very wavelength-dependent because the cloud droplets are larger than the lights wavelength and scatter all colors approximately equally the light passes through the translucent clouds in a manner similar to frosted glass the intensity ranges roughly from of direct sunlight for relatively thin clouds down to of direct sunlight under the extreme of thickest storm clouds.nnas a part of total radiationeditnone of the equations for total solar radiation is:nnnwhere h is the beam radiation irradiance r is the tilt factor for beam radiation h is the diffuse radiation irradiance r is the tilt factor for diffuse radiation and r is the tilt factor for reflected radiation.nr is given by:nnnwhere is the solar declination is the latitude is an angle from the horizontal and h is the solar hour angle.nr is given by:nnnand r by:nnnwhere is the reflectivity of the surface.nneruption of mt pinatubo and agricultureeditnsee also photosynthesisn a space shuttle mission sts-43 photograph of the earth over south america taken on august 8 1991 which captures the double layer of pinatubo aerosol clouds dark streaks above lower cloud tops.nthe eruption of the philippines volcano mount pinatubo in june 1991 ejected roughly 10 km 2.4 cu mi of magma and 17,000,000 metric tons"17 teragrams of sulfur dioxide so into the air introducing ten times as much total so as the 1991 kuwaiti fires mostly during the explosive plinian/ultra-plinian event of june 15 1991 creating a global stratospheric so haze layer which persisted for years this resulted in the global average temperature dropping by about 0.5 c 0.9 f as volcanic ash falls out of the atmosphere rapidly the negative agricultural effects of the eruption were largely immediate and localized to a relatively small area in close proximity to the eruption as they were caused by the resulting thick ash cover that resulted globally however despite a several-month 5 drop in overall solar irradiation and a reduction in direct sunlight by 30 there was no negative impact to global agriculture surprisingly a 3-4 year increase in global agricultural productivity and forestry growth was observed excepting boreal forest regions under more-or-less direct sunlight dark shadows that limit photosynthesis are cast onto understorey leaves within the thicket very little direct sunlight can enter the means by which this was discovered is that initially at the time a mysterious drop in the rate at which carbon dioxide co was filling the atmosphere was observed which is charted in what is known as the keeling curve this led numerous scientists to assume that this reduction was due to the lowering of the earths temperature and with that a slow down in plant and soil respiration indicating a deleterious impact to global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer however upon actual investigation the reduction in the rate at which carbon dioxide filled the atmosphere did not match up with the hypothesis that plant respiration rates had declined instead the advantageous anomaly was relatively firmly linked to an unprecedented increase in the growth/net primary production of global plant life resulting in the increase of the carbon sink effect of global photosynthesis the mechanism by which the increase in plant growth was possible was that the 30 reduction of direct sunlight can also be expressed as an increase or enhancement in the amount of diffuse sunlight.n well lit understorey areas due to overcast clouds creating diffuse/soft sunlight conditions that permits photosynthesis on leaves under the canopy.nthis diffuse light owing to its intrinsic nature can illuminate under-canopy leaves permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case in stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies and the direct sunlight that results from it which casts shadows onto understorey leaves strictly limiting plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer this increase in global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer also naturally results as a product of other aerosols that are not emitted by volcanoes such as man-made moderately thick smoke loading pollution as the same mechanism the aerosol direct radiative effect is behind both.nnnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnfurther readingeditnnexternal linkseditnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
