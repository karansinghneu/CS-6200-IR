has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination individual random events are by definition unpredictable but in many cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of events or trials is predictable for example when throwing two dice the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4 in this view randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome rather than haphazardness and applies to concepts of chance probability and information entropy.nthe fields of mathematics probability and statistics use formal definitions of randomness in statistics a random variable is an assignment of a numerical value to each possible outcome of an event space this association facilitates the identification and the calculation of probabilities of the events random variables can appear in random sequences a random process is a sequence of random variables whose outcomes do not follow a deterministic pattern but follow an evolution described by probability distributions these and other constructs are extremely useful in probability theory and the various applications of randomness.nrandomness is most often used in statistics to signify well-defined statistical properties monte carlo methods which rely on random input such as from random number generators or pseudorandom number generators are important techniques in science as for instance in computational science by analogy quasi-monte carlo methods use quasirandom number generators.nrandom selection when narrowly associated with a simple random sample is a method of selecting items often called units from a population where the probability of choosing a specific item is the proportion of those items in the population for example with a bowl containing just 10 red marbles and 90 blue marbles a random selection mechanism would choose a red marble with probability 1/10 note that a random selection mechanism that selected 10 marbles from this bowl would not necessarily result in 1 red and 9 blue in situations where a population consists of items that are distinguishable a random selection mechanism requires equal probabilities for any item to be chosen that is if the selection process is such that each member of a population of say research subjects has the same probability of being chosen then we can say the selection process is random.nncontentsnnnhistorynmain article history of randomnessn ancient fresco of dice players in pompei.nin ancient history the concepts of chance and randomness were intertwined with that of fate many ancient peoples threw dice to determine fate and this later evolved into games of chance most ancient cultures used various methods of divination to attempt to circumvent randomness and fate.nthe chinese of 3000 years ago were perhaps the earliest people to formalize odds and chance the greek philosophers discussed randomness at length but only in non-quantitative forms it was only in the 16th century that italian mathematicians began to formalize the odds associated with various games of chance the invention of the calculus had a positive impact on the formal study of randomness in the 1888 edition of his book the logic of chance john venn wrote a chapter on the conception of randomness that included his view of the randomness of the digits of the number pi by using them to construct a random walk in two dimensions.nthe early part of the 20th century saw a rapid growth in the formal analysis of randomness as various approaches to the mathematical foundations of probability were introduced in the mid to late-20th century ideas of algorithmic information theory introduced new dimensions to the field via the concept of algorithmic randomness.nalthough randomness had often been viewed as an obstacle and a nuisance for many centuries in the 20th century computer scientists began to realize that the deliberate introduction of randomness into computations can be an effective tool for designing better algorithms in some cases such randomized algorithms outperform the best deterministic methods.nnin sciencenmany scientific fields are concerned with randomness:nnnnnin the physical sciencesnin the 19th century scientists used the idea of random motions of molecules in the development of statistical mechanics to explain phenomena in thermodynamics and the properties of gases.naccording to several standard interpretations of quantum mechanics microscopic phenomena are objectively random that is in an experiment that controls all causally relevant parameters some aspects of the outcome still vary randomly for example if a single unstable atom is placed in a controlled environment it cannot be predicted how long it will take for the atom to decayonly the probability of decay in a given time thus quantum mechanics does not specify the outcome of individual experiments but only the probabilities hidden variable theories reject the view that nature contains irreducible randomness such theories posit that in the processes that appear random properties with a certain statistical distribution are at work behind the scenes determining the outcome in each case.nnin biologynthe modern evolutionary synthesis ascribes the observed diversity of life to random genetic mutations followed by natural selection the latter retains some random mutations in the gene pool due to the systematically improved chance for survival and reproduction that those mutated genes confer on individuals who possess them.nseveral authors also claim that evolution and sometimes development require a specific form of randomness namely the introduction of qualitatively new behaviors instead of the choice of one possibility among several pre-given ones this randomness corresponds to the formation of new possibilities.nthe characteristics of an organism arise to some extent deterministically e.g under the influence of genes and the environment and to some extent randomly for example the density of freckles that appear on a persons skin is controlled by genes and exposure to light whereas the exact location of individual freckles seems random.nas far as behavior is concerned randomness is important if an animal is to behave in a way that is unpredictable to others for instance insects in flight tend to move about with random changes in direction making it difficult for pursuing predators to predict their trajectories.nnin mathematicsnthe mathematical theory of probability arose from attempts to formulate mathematical descriptions of chance events originally in the context of gambling but later in connection with physics statistics is used to infer the underlying probability distribution of a collection of empirical observations for the purposes of simulation it is necessary to have a large supply of random numbers or means to generate them on demand.nalgorithmic information theory studies among other topics what constitutes a random sequence the central idea is that a string of bits is random if and only if it is shorter than any computer program that can produce that string kolmogorov randomnessthis means that random strings are those that cannot be compressed pioneers of this field include andrey kolmogorov and his student per martin-lf ray solomonoff and gregory chaitin for the notion of infinite sequence one normally uses per martin-lfs definition.nthat is an infinite sequence is random if and only if it withstands all recursively enumerable null sets the other notions of random sequences include but not limited to recursive randomness and schnorr randomness which are based on recursively computable martingales it was shown by yongge wang that these randomness notions are generally different.nrandomness occurs in numbers such as log 2 and pi the decimal digits of pi constitute an infinite sequence and never repeat in a cyclical fashion numbers like pi are also considered likely to be normal which means their digits are random in a certain statistical sense.nnnpi certainly seems to behave this way in the first six billion decimal places of pi each of the digits from 0 through 9 shows up about six hundred million times yet such results conceivably accidental do not prove normality even in base 10 much less normality in other number bases.nin statisticsnmain article statistical randomnessnin statistics randomness is commonly used to create simple random samples this lets surveys of completely random groups of people provide realistic data common methods of doing this include drawing names out of a hat or using a random digit chart a random digit chart is simply a large table of random digits.nnin information sciencenin information science irrelevant or meaningless data is considered noise noise consists of a large number of transient disturbances with a statistically randomized time distribution.nin communication theory randomness in a signal is called noise and is opposed to that component of its variation that is causally attributable to the source the signal.nin terms of the development of random networks for communication randomness rests on the two simple assumptions of paul erds and alfrd rnyi who said that there were a fixed number of nodes and this number remained fixed for the life of the network and that all nodes were equal and linked randomly to each other.nnin financenthe random walk hypothesis considers that asset prices in an organized market evolve at random in the sense that the expected value of their change is zero but the actual value may turn out to be positive or negative more generally asset prices are influenced by a variety of unpredictable events in the general economic environment.nnin politicsnrandom selection can be an official method to resolve tied elections in some jurisdictions its use in politics is very old as office holders in ancient athens were chosen by lot there being no voting.nnrandomness and religionnrandomness can be seen as conflicting with the deterministic ideas of some religions such as those where the universe is created by an omniscient deity who is aware of all past and future events if the universe is regarded to have a purpose then randomness can be seen as impossible this is one of the rationales for religious opposition to evolution which states that non-random selection is applied to the results of random genetic variation.nhindu and buddhist philosophies state that any event is the result of previous events as reflected in the concept of karma and as such there is no such thing as a random event or a first event.nin some religious contexts procedures that are commonly perceived as randomizers are used for divination cleromancy uses the casting of bones or dice to reveal what is seen as the will of the gods.nnapplicationsnmain article applications of randomnessnin most of its mathematical political social and religious uses randomness is used for its innate fairness and lack of bias.npolitics athenian democracy was based on the concept of isonomia equality of political rights and used complex allotment machines to ensure that the positions on the ruling committees that ran athens were fairly allocated allotment is now restricted to selecting jurors in anglo-saxon legal systems and in situations where fairness is approximated by randomization such as selecting jurors and military draft lotteries.ngames random numbers were first investigated in the context of gambling and many randomizing devices such as dice shuffling playing cards and roulette wheels were first developed for use in gambling the ability to produce random numbers fairly is vital to electronic gambling and as such the methods used to create them are usually regulated by government gaming control boards random drawings are also used to determine lottery winners throughout history randomness has been used for games of chance and to select out individuals for an unwanted task in a fair way see drawing straws.nsports some sports including american football use coin tosses to randomly select starting conditions for games or seed tied teams for postseason play the national basketball association uses a weighted lottery to order teams in its draft.nmathematics random numbers are also employed where their use is mathematically important such as sampling for opinion polls and for statistical sampling in quality control systems computational solutions for some types of problems use random numbers extensively such as in the monte carlo method and in genetic algorithms.nmedicine random allocation of a clinical intervention is used to reduce bias in controlled trials e.g randomized controlled trials.nreligion although not intended to be random various forms of divination such as cleromancy see what appears to be a random event as a means for a divine being to communicate their will see also free will and determinism.nngenerationnmain article random number generationn the ball in a roulette can be used as a source of apparent randomness because its behavior is very sensitive to the initial conditions.nit is generally accepted that there exist three mechanisms responsible for apparently random behavior in systems:nnnthe many applications of randomness have led to many different methods for generating random data these methods may vary as to how unpredictable or statistically random they are and how quickly they can generate random numbers.nbefore the advent of computational random number generators generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers important in statistics required a lot of work results would sometimes be collected and distributed as random number tables.nnmeasures and testsnmain article randomness testsnthere are many practical measures of randomness for a binary sequence these include measures based on frequency discrete transforms and complexity or a mixture of these these include tests by kak phillips yuen hopkins beth and dai mund and marsaglia and zaman.nquantum non-locality has been used to certify the presence of genuine randomness in a given string of numbers.nnmisconceptions and logical fallaciesnmain article gamblers fallacynpopular perceptions of randomness are frequently mistaken based on fallacious reasoning or intuitions.nna number is due"nsee also coupon collectors problemnthis argument is in a random selection of numbers since all numbers eventually appear those that have not come up yet are due and thus more likely to come up soon this logic is only correct if applied to a system where numbers that come up are removed from the system such as when playing cards are drawn and not returned to the deck in this case once a jack is removed from the deck the next draw is less likely to be a jack and more likely to be some other card however if the jack is returned to the deck and the deck is thoroughly reshuffled a jack is as likely to be drawn as any other card the same applies in any other process where objects are selected independently and none are removed after each event such as the roll of a die a coin toss or most lottery number selection schemes truly random processes such as these do not have memory making it impossible for past outcomes to affect future outcomes.nna number is cursed or blessed"nsee also benfords lawnin a random sequence of numbers a number may be said to be cursed because it has come up less often in the past and so it is thought that it will occur less often in the future a number may be assumed to be blessed because it has occurred more often than others in the past and so it is thought likely to come up more often in the future this logic is valid only if the randomisation is biased for example with a loaded die if the die is fair then previous rolls give no indication of future events.nin nature events rarely occur with perfectly equal frequency so observing outcomes to determine which events are more probable makes sense it is fallacious to apply this logic to systems designed to make all outcomes equally likely such as shuffled cards dice and roulette wheels.nnodds are never dynamicnin the beginning of a scenario one might calculate the probability of a certain event the fact is as soon as one gains more information about that situation they may need to re-calculate the probability.nn when the host reveals one door that contains a goat this is new information.nsay we are told that a woman has two children if we ask whether either of them is a girl and are told yes what is the probability that the other child is also a girl considering this new child independently one might expect the probability that the other child is female is 50 but by building a probability space illustrating all possible outcomes we see that the probability is actually only 33 this is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children boy-boy girl-boy boy-girl and girl-girl but we were given more information once we are told that one of the children is a female we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female boy-girl girl-boy girl-girl only of these scenarios would have the other child also be a girl using a probability space we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios or to neglect the importance of new information for further information see boy or girl paradox.nthis technique provides insights in other situations such as the monty hall problem a game show scenario in which a car is hidden behind one of three doors and two goats are hidden as booby prizes behind the others once the contestant has chosen a door the host opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat eliminating that door as an option with only two doors left one with the car the other with another goat the player must decide to either keep their decision or switch and select the other door intuitively one might think the player is choosing between two doors with equal probability and that the opportunity to choose another door makes no difference but probability spaces reveal that the contestant has received new information and can increase their chances of winning by changing to the other door.nnsee alsonnnnnnreferencesnnnfurther readingnnexternal linksnnnnnnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
