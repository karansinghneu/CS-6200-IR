africa and asiannnnthe mediterranean sea is a sea connected to the atlantic ocean surrounded by the mediterranean basin and almost completely enclosed by land on the north by southern europe and anatolia on the south by north africa and on the east by the levant although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the atlantic ocean it is usually identified as a separate body of water geological evidence indicates that around 5.9 million years ago the mediterranean was cut off from the atlantic and was partly or completely desiccated over a period of some 600,000 years the messinian salinity crisis before being refilled by the zanclean flood about 5.3 million years ago.nit covers an approximate area of 2.5 million km 965,000 sq mi but its connection to the atlantic the strait of gibraltar is only 14 km 8.7 mi wide the strait of gibraltar is a narrow strait that connects the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea and separates gibraltar and spain in europe from morocco in africa in oceanography it is sometimes called the eurafrican mediterranean sea or the european mediterranean sea to distinguish it from mediterranean seas elsewhere.nthe mediterranean sea has an average depth of 1,500 m 4,900 ft and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m 17,280 ft in the calypso deep in the ionian sea the sea is bordered on the north by europe the east by asia and in the south by africa it is located between latitudes 30 and 46 n and longitudes 6 w and 36 e its west-east length from the strait of gibraltar to the gulf of iskenderun on the southwestern coast of turkey is approximately 4,000 km 2,500 miles the seas average north-south length from croatias southern shore to libya is approximately 800 km 500 miles the mediterranean sea including the sea of marmara connected by the dardanelles to the aegean sea has a surface area of approximately 2,510,000 square km 970,000 square miles.nthe sea was an important route for merchants and travellers of ancient times that allowed for trade and cultural exchange between emergent peoples of the region the history of the mediterranean region is crucial to understanding the origins and development of many modern societies.nthe countries surrounding the mediterranean in clockwise order are spain france monaco italy slovenia croatia bosnia and herzegovina montenegro albania greece turkey syria lebanon israel egypt libya tunisia algeria and morocco malta and cyprus are island countries in the sea in addition the gaza strip and the british overseas territories of gibraltar and akrotiri and dhekelia have coastlines on the sea.nncontentsnnnnames and etymologyeditn with its highly indented coastline and large number of islands greece has the longest mediterranean coastline.nthe ancient greeks called the mediterranean simply the sea or sometimes the great sea our sea or the sea around us the romans called it mare magnum great sea or mare internum internal sea and starting with the roman empire mare nostrum our sea the term mare mediterrneum appears later solinus apparently used it in the 3rd century but the earliest extant witness to it is in the 6th century in isidore of seville it means in the middle of land inland in latin a compound of medius middle terra land earth and neus having the nature of the latin word is a calque of greek inland from in the middle and of the earth from land earth the original meaning may have been the sea in the middle of the earth rather than the sea enclosed by land.nthe carthaginians called it the syrian sea in ancient syrian texts phoenician epics and in the hebrew bible it was primarily known as the great sea hayam hagadol numbers 34:6,7 joshua 1:4 9:1 15:47 ezekiel 47:10,15,20 or simply as the sea 1 kings 5:9 compare 1 macc 14:34 15:11 however it has also been called the hinder sea because of its location on the west coast of greater syria or the holy land and therefore behind a person facing the east which is sometimes translated as western sea deut 11:24 joel 2:20 another name was the sea of the philistines exod 23:31 from the people inhabiting a large portion of its shores near the israelites in modern hebrew it is called hayam hatikhon the middle sea.nin modern arabic it is known as al-bar al-abya al-mutawassi the white middle sea in islamic and older arabic literature it was bar al-rm or the sea of the romans or the roman sea at first that name referred to only the eastern mediterranean but it was later extended to the whole mediterranean other arabic names were bar al-m the sea of syria and bar al-maghrib the sea of the west.nin turkish it is the akdeniz the white sea in ottoman which sometimes means only the aegean sea the origin of the name is not clear as it is not known in earlier greek byzantine or islamic sources it may be to contrast with the black sea in persian the name was translated as bar-i safd which was also used in later ottoman turkish it is probably the origin of the colloquial greek johann knobloch claims that in classical antiquity cultures in the levant used colours to refer to the cardinal points black referred to the north explaining the name black sea yellow or blue to east red to south i.e the red sea and white to west this would explain both the turkish akdeniz white sea and the arab nomenclature described above.nnhistoryeditnmain article history of the mediterranean regionnancient civilizationseditn greek red and phoenician yellow colonies in antiquity c the 6th century bcen the roman empire at its farthest extent in ad 117nseveral ancient civilizations were located around the mediterranean shores and were greatly influenced by their proximity to the sea it provided routes for trade colonization and war as well as food from fishing and the gathering of other seafood for numerous communities throughout the ages.ndue to the shared climate geology and access to the sea cultures centered on the mediterranean tended to have some extent of intertwined culture and history.ntwo of the most notable mediterranean civilizations in classical antiquity were the greek city states and the phoenicians both of which extensively colonized the coastlines of the mediterranean later when augustus founded the roman empire the romans referred to the mediterranean as mare nostrum our sea for the next 400 years the roman empire completely controlled the mediterranean sea and virtually all its coastal regions from gibraltar to the levant.ndarius i of persia who conquered ancient egypt built a canal linking the mediterranean to the red sea dariuss canal was wide enough for two triremes to pass each other with oars extended and required four days to traverse.nnmiddle ages and empireseditn the battle of lepanto 1571 ended in victory for the european holy league against the ottoman turks.nthe western roman empire collapsed around ad 476 temporarily the east was again dominant as roman power lived on in the byzantine empire formed in the 4th century from the eastern half of the roman empire another power arose in the 7th century and with it the religion of islam which soon swept across from the east at its greatest extent the arab empire controlled 75 of the mediterranean region and left a lasting footprint on its eastern and southern shores.nthe arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between western and eastern europe while cutting the trade route with oriental lands this however had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the caspian sea the export of grains from egypt was re-routed towards the eastern world oriental goods like silk and spices were carried from egypt to ports like venice and constantinople by sailors and jewish merchants the viking raids further disrupted the trade in western europe and brought it to a halt however the norsemen developed the trade from norway to the white sea while also trading in luxury goods from spain and the mediterranean the byzantines in the mid-8th century retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the mediterranean venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by arabs while concentrating trade of oriental goods at venice.nthe fatimids maintained trade relations with the italian city-states like amalfi and genoa before the crusades according to the cairo geniza documents a document dated 996 mentions amalfian merchants living in cairo another letter states that the genoese had traded with alexandria the caliph al-mustansir had allowed amalfian merchants to reside in jerusalem about 1060 in place of the latin hospice.nthe crusades led to flourishing of trade between europe and the outremer region genoa venica and pisa created colonies in regions controlled by the crusaders and came to control the trade with the orient these colonies also allowed them to trade with the eastern world though the fall of the crusader states and attempts at banning of trade relations with muslim states by the popes temporarily disrupted the trade with the orient it however continued.neurope started to revive however as more organized and centralized states began to form in the later middle ages after the renaissance of the 12th century.nn the bombardment of algiers by the anglo-dutch fleet in support of an ultimatum to release european slaves august 1816nottoman power based in anatolia continued to grow and in 1453 extinguished the byzantine empire with the conquest of constantinople ottomans gained control of much of the sea in the 16th century and maintained naval bases in southern france 1543-1544 algeria and tunisia barbarossa the famous ottoman captain is a symbol of this domination with the victory of the battle of preveza 1538 the battle of djerba 1560 marked the apex of ottoman naval domination in the mediterranean as the naval prowess of the european powers increased they confronted ottoman expansion in the region when the battle of lepanto 1571 checked the power of the ottoman navy this was the last naval battle to be fought primarily between galleys.nthe barbary pirates of northwest africa preyed on christian shipping and coastlines in the western mediterranean sea according to robert davis from the 16th to 19th centuries pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million europeans as slaves.nthe development of oceanic shipping began to affect the entire mediterranean once most trade between western europe and the east had passed through the region but after the 1490s the development of a sea route to the indian ocean allowed the importation of asian spices and other goods through the atlantic ports of western europe.nthe sea remained strategically important british mastery of gibraltar ensured their influence in africa and southwest asia wars included naval warfare in the mediterranean during world war i.nn21st century and migrationseditnnnnnnn satellite image of the mediterranean sea at

martin schulz said in 2014 that europes migration policy turned the mediterranean into a graveyard referring to the number of drowned refugees in the region as a direct result of the policies an azerbaijani official described the sea as a burial ground where people die".nfollowing the 2013 lampedusa migrant shipwreck the italian government decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the mediterranean sea by authorising operation mare nostrum a military and humanitarian mission in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants in 2015 more than one million migrants crossed the mediterranean sea into europe.nitaly was particularly affected by the european migrant crisis since 2013 over 700,000 migrants have landed in italy mainly sub-saharan

mediterranean sea is connected to the atlantic ocean by the strait of gibraltar known in homers writings as the pillars of hercules in the west and to the sea of marmara and the black sea by the dardanelles and the bosporus respectively in the east the sea of marmara dardanelles is often considered a part of the mediterranean sea whereas the black sea is generally not the 163 km 101 mi long

mediterranean sea for instance tides are very limited as a result of the narrow connection with the atlantic ocean the mediterranean is characterised and immediately recognised by its deep blue colour.nevaporation greatly exceeds precipitation and river runoff in the mediterranean a fact that is central to the water circulation within the basin evaporation is especially high in its eastern half causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase eastward the salinity at 5 m depth is 3.8%.nthe pressure gradient pushes relatively cool low-salinity water from the atlantic across the basin it warms and becomes saltier as it travels east then sinks in the region of the levant and circulates westward to spill over the strait of gibraltar thus seawater flow is eastward in the straits surface waters and westward below once in the atlantic this chemically distinct mediterranean intermediate water can persist thousands of kilometres away from its source.nthe temperature of

ripplings of an otherwise calm sea surface.nthe geologic history of the mediterranean sea is complex underlain by oceanic crust the sea basin was once thought to be a tectonic remnant of the ancient tethys ocean it is now known to be a structurally younger basin called the neotethys which was first formed by the convergence of the african and eurasian plates during the late triassic and early jurassic because it is a near-landlocked body of water in a normally dry climate the mediterranean is subject to intensive evaporation and the precipitation of evaporites the messinian salinity crisis started about six million years ago mya when the mediterranean became landlocked and then essentially dried up there are salt deposits accumulated on the bottom of the basin of more than a million cubic kilometresin some places more than three kilometres thick.nscientists estimate that the sea was last filled about 5.3 million years ago mya in less than two years by the zanclean flood water poured in from the atlantic ocean through a newly breached gateway now called the strait of gibraltar at an estimated rate of about three orders of magnitude one thousand times larger than the current flow of the amazon river.nthe mediterranean sea has an average depth of 1,500 m 4,900 ft and the deepest recorded point is 5,267 m 17,280 ft in the calypso deep in the ionian sea the coastline extends for 46,000 km 29,000 mi a shallow submarine ridge the strait of sicily between the island of sicily and the coast of tunisia divides the sea in two main subregions the western mediterranean with an area of about 850 thousand km 330 thousand mi and the eastern mediterranean of about 1.65 million km 640 thousand mi a characteristic of the coastal mediterranean are submarine karst springs or vruljas which discharge pressurised groundwater into the coastal seawater from below the surface the discharge water is usually fresh and sometimes may be thermal.nntectonics and paleoenvironmental analysiseditnnthe mediterranean basin and sea system was established by the ancient african-arabian continent colliding with the eurasian continent as africa-arabia drifted northward it closed over the ancient tethys ocean which had earlier separated the two supercontinents laurasia and gondwana.nat about that time in the middle jurassic period roughly 170 million years ago a much smaller sea basin dubbed the neotethys was formed shortly before the tethys ocean closed at its western arabian end the broad line of collisions pushed up a very long system of mountains from the pyrenees in spain to the zagros mountains in iran in an episode of mountain-building tectonics known as the alpine orogeny the neotethys grew larger during the episodes of collisions and associated foldings and subductions that occurred during the oligocene and miocene epochs 34 to 5.33 mya see animation africa-arabia colliding with eurasia accordingly the mediterranean basin consists of several stretched tectonic plates in subduction which are the foundation of the eastern part of the mediterranean sea various zones of subduction harbour and form the deepest and most majestic oceanic ridges east of the ionian sea and south of the aegean the central indian ridge runs east of the mediterranean sea south-east across the in-between of africa and the arabian peninsula into the indian ocean.nnmessinian salinity crisiseditn messinian salinity crisis before the zanclean floodnplay media animation messinian salinity crisisnduring mesozoic and cenozoic times as the northwest corner of africa converged on iberia it lifted the betic-rif mountain belts across southern iberia and northwest africa there the development of the intramontane betic and rif basins led to creating two roughly-parallel marine gateways between the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea dubbed the betic and rifian corridors they progressively closed during middle and late miocene times perhaps several times during late miocene times the closure of the betic corridor triggered the so-called messinian salinity crisis msc when the mediterranean almost entirely dried out the time of beginning of the msc was recently estimated astronomically at 5.96 mya and it persisted for some 630,000 years until about 5.3 mya see animation messinian salinity crisis at right.nafter the initial drawdown and re-flooding there followed more episodesthe total number is debatedof sea drawdowns and re-floodings for the duration of the msc it ended when the atlantic ocean last re-flooded the basincreating the strait of gibraltar and causing the zanclean floodat the end of the miocene 5.33 mya some research has suggested that a desiccation-flooding-desiccation cycle may have repeated several times which could explain several events of large amounts of salt deposition recent studies however show that repeated desiccation and re-flooding is unlikely from a geodynamic point of view.nnndesiccation and exchanges of flora and faunaeditnthe present-day atlantic gateway i.e the strait of gibraltar originated in the early pliocene via the zanclean flood as mentioned two other gateways preceded gibraltar the betic corridor across southern spain and the rifian corridor across northern morocco the former gateway closed about six 6 mya causing the messinian salinity crisis msc the latter or possibly both gateways closed during the earlier tortonian times causing a tortonian salinity crisis from 11.6 to 7.2 mya which occurred well before the msc and lasted much longer both crises resulted in broad connections of the mainlands of africa and europe which thereby normalised migrations of flora and faunaespecially large mammals including primatesbetween the two continents the vallesian crisis indicates a typical extinction and replacement of mammal species in europe during tortonian times following climatic upheaval and overland migrations of new species see animation messinian salinity crisis and mammal migrations at right.nthe near-completely enclosed configuration of the mediterranean basin has enabled the oceanic gateways to dominate seawater circulation and the environmental evolution of the sea and basin circulation patterns are also affected by several other factorsincluding climate bathymetry and water chemistry and temperaturewhich are interactive and can induce precipitation of evaporites deposits of evaporites accumulated earlier in the nearby carpathian foredeep during the middle miocene and the adjacent red sea basin during the late miocene and in the whole mediterranean basin during the msc and the messinian age diatomites are regularly found underneath the evaporite deposits suggesting a connection between their geneses.ntoday evaporation of surface seawater output is more than the supply input of fresh water by precipitation and coastal drainage systems causing the salinity of the mediterranean to be much higher than that of the atlanticso much so that the saltier mediterranean waters sink below the waters incoming from the atlantic causing a two-layer flow across the gibraltar strait that is an outflow submarine current of warm saline mediterranean water counterbalanced by an inflow surface current of less saline cold oceanic water from the atlantic herman srgels atlantropa project proposal in the 1920s proposed a hydroelectric dam to be built across the strait of gibraltar using the inflow current to provide a large amount of hydroelectric energy the underlying energy grid was as well intended to support a political union between europe and at least the marghreb part of africa compare eurafrika for the later impact and desertec for a later project with some parallels in the planned grid.nnshift to a mediterranean climate"editnthe end of the miocene also marked a change in the climate of the mediterranean basin fossil evidence from that period reveals that the larger basin had a humid subtropical climate with rainfall in the summer supporting laurel forests the shift to a mediterranean climate occurred largely within the last three million years the late pliocene epoch as summer rainfall decreased the subtropical laurel forests retreated and even as they persisted on the islands of macaronesia off the atlantic coast of iberia and north africa the present mediterranean vegetation evolved dominated by coniferous trees and sclerophyllous trees and shrubs with small hard waxy leaves that prevent moisture loss in the dry summers much of these forests and shrublands have been altered beyond recognition by thousands of years of human habitation there are now very few relatively intact natural areas in what was once a heavily wooded region.nnpaleoclimateeditnbecause of its latitudinal position and its land-locked configuration the mediterranean is especially sensitive to astronomically induced climatic variations which are well documented in its sedimentary record since the mediterranean is involved in the deposition of eolian dust from the sahara during dry periods whereas riverine detrital input prevails during wet ones the mediterranean marine sapropel-bearing sequences provide high-resolution climatic information these data have been employed in reconstructing astronomically calibrated time scales for the last 9 ma of the earths history helping to constrain the time of past geomagnetic reversals furthermore the exceptional accuracy of these paleoclimatic records has improved our knowledge of the earths orbital variations in the past.nnecology and biotaeditnas a result of the drying of the sea during the messinian salinity crisis the marine biota of the mediterranean are derived primarily from the atlantic ocean the north atlantic is considerably colder and more nutrient-rich than the mediterranean and the marine life of the mediterranean has had to adapt to its differing conditions in the five million years since the basin was reflooded.nthe alboran sea is a transition zone between the two seas containing a mix of mediterranean and atlantic species the alboran sea has the largest population of bottlenose dolphins in the western mediterranean is home to the last population of harbour porpoises in the mediterranean and is the most important feeding grounds for loggerhead sea turtles in europe the alboran sea also hosts important commercial fisheries including sardines and swordfish the mediterranean monk seals live in the aegean sea in greece in 2003 the world wildlife fund raised concerns about the widespread drift net fishing endangering populations of dolphins turtles and other marine animals such as the galathea strigosa.nnsee also specially protected areas of mediterranean importancenenvironmental historyeditnnfor 4,000 years human activity has transformed most parts of mediterranean europe and the humanisation of the landscape overlapped with the appearance of the present mediterranean climate the image of a simplistic environmental determinist notion of a mediterranean paradise on earth in antiquity which was destroyed by later civilisations dates back to at least the 18th century and was for centuries fashionable in archaeological and historical circles based on a broad variety of methods e.g historical documents analysis of trade relations floodplain sediments pollen tree-ring and further archaeometric analyses and population studies alfred thomas grove and oliver rackhams work on the nature of mediterranean europe challenges this common wisdom of a mediterranean europe as a lost eden a formerly fertile and forested region that had been progressively degraded and desertified by human mismanagement the belief stems more from the failure of the recent landscape to measure up to the imaginary past of the classics as idealised by artists poets and scientists of the early modern enlightenment.nthe historical evolution of climate vegetation and landscape in southern europe from prehistoric times to the present is much more complex and underwent various changes for example some of the deforestation had already taken place before the roman age while in the roman age large enterprises as the latifundiums took effective care of forests and agriculture the largest depopulation effects came with the end of the empire some assume that the major deforestation took place in modern timesthe later usage patterns were also quite different e.g in southern and northern italy also the climate has usually been unstable and showing various ancient and modern little ice ages and plant cover accommodated to various extremes and became resilient with regard to various patterns of human activity.nhumanisation was therefore not the cause of climate change but followed it the wide ecological diversity typical of mediterranean europe is predominantly based on human behavior as it is and has been closely related human usage patterns the diversity range was enhanced by the widespread exchange and interaction of the longstanding and highly diverse local agriculture intense transport and trade relations and the interaction with settlements pasture and other land use the greatest human-induced changes however came after world war ii respectively in line with the 1950s-syndrome as rural populations throughout the region abandoned traditional subsistence economies grove and rackham suggest that the locals left the traditional agricultural patterns towards taking a role as scenery-setting agents for the then much more important tourism travellers this resulted in more monotonous large-scale formations among further current important threats to mediterranean landscapes are overdevelopment of coastal areas abandonment of mountains and as mentioned the loss of variety via the reduction of traditional agricultural occupations.nnnatural hazardseditn stromboli volcano in italynthe region has a variety of geological hazards which have closely interacted with human activity and land use patterns among others in the eastern mediterranean the thera eruption dated to the 17th or 16th century bc caused a large tsunami that some experts hypothesise devastated the minoan civilisation on the nearby island of crete further leading some to believe that this may have been the catastrophe that inspired the atlantis legend mount vesuvius is the only active volcano on the european mainland while others as mount etna and stromboli are to be found on neighbouring islands the region around vesuvius including the phlegraean fields caldera west of naples are quite active and constitute the most densely populated volcanic region in the world where an eruptive event may occur within decades.nvesuvius itself is regarded as quite dangerous due to a tendency towards explosive plinian eruptions.nit is best known for its eruption in ad 79 that led to the burying and destruction of the roman cities of pompeii and herculaneum.nthe large experience of member states and regional authorities has led to exchange on the international level with cooperation of ngos states regional and municipality authorities and private persons the greekturkish earthquake diplomacy is a quite positive example of natural hazards leading to improved relations of traditional rivals in the region after earthquakes in zmir and athens 1999 the european union solidarity fund eusf was set up to respond to major natural disasters and express european solidarity to disaster-stricken regions within all of europe the largest amount of fund requests in the eu is being directed to forest fires followed by floodings and earthquakes forest fires are whether man made or natural an often recurring and dangerous hazard in the mediterranean region also tsunamis are an often underestimated hazard in the region for example the 1908 messina earthquake and tsunami took more than 123,000 lives in sicily and calabria and is among the most deadly natural disasters in modern europe.nnbiodiversityeditnsee also list of fish of the mediterranean sea and list of fish of the black seanunlike the vast multidirectional ocean currents in open oceans within their respective oceanic zones biodiversity in the mediterranean sea is that of a stable one due to the subtle but strong locked nature of currents which affects favorably even the smallest macroscopic type of volcanic life form the stable marine ecosystem of the mediterranean sea and sea temperature provides a nourishing environment for life in the deep sea to flourish while assuring a balanced aquatic ecosystem excluded from any external deep oceanic factors.nninvasive specieseditn the reticulate whipray is one of the species that colonised the eastern mediterranean through the suez canal as part of the ongoing lessepsian migration.nthe opening of the suez canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the mediterranean and red sea the red sea is higher than the eastern mediterranean so the canal serves as a tidal strait that pours red sea water into the mediterranean the bitter lakes which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal blocked the migration of red sea species into the mediterranean for many decades but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the red sea the barrier to migration was removed and plants and animals from the red sea have begun to colonise the eastern mediterranean the red sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the atlantic so the red sea species have advantages over atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor eastern mediterranean accordingly red sea species invade the mediterranean biota and not vice versa this phenomenon is known as the lessepsian migration after ferdinand de lesseps the french engineer or erythrean invasion the construction of the aswan high dam across the nile river in the 1960s reduced the inflow of freshwater and nutrient-rich silt from the nile into the eastern mediterranean making conditions there even more like the red sea and worsening the impact of the invasive species.ninvasive species have become a major component of the mediterranean ecosystem and have serious impacts on the mediterranean ecology endangering many local and endemic mediterranean species a first look at some groups of exotic species show that more than 70 of the non-indigenous decapods and about 63 of the exotic fishes occurring in the mediterranean are of indo pacific origin introduced into the mediterranean through the suez canal this makes the canal as the first pathway of arrival of alien species into the mediterranean the impacts of some lessepsian species have proven to be considerable mainly in the levantine basin of the mediterranean where they are replacing native species and becoming a familiar sight".naccording to the international union for conservation of nature definition as well as convention on biological diversity cbd and ramsar convention terminologies they are alien species as they are non-native non-indigenous to the mediterranean sea and they are outside their normal area of distribution which is the indo-pacific region when these species succeed in establishing populations in the mediterranean sea compete with and begin to replace native species they are alien invasive species as they are an agent of change and a threat to the native biodiversity in the context of cbd introduction refers to the movement by human agency indirect or direct of an alien species outside of its natural range past or present the suez canal being an artificial man made canal is a human agency lessepsian migrants are therefore introduced species indirect and unintentional whatever wording is chosen they represent a threat to the native mediterranean biodiversity because they are non-indigenous to this sea in recent years the egyptian governments announcement of its intentions to deepen and widen the canal have raised concerns from marine biologists fearing that such an act will only worsen the invasion of red sea species into the mediterranean facilitating the crossing of the canal for yet additional species.nnarrival of new tropical atlantic specieseditnin recent decades the arrival of exotic species from the tropical atlantic has become a noticeable feature whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the mediterranean through the gibraltar strait because of a warming trend of the water caused by global warming or an extension of the maritime traffic or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation is still an open question while not as intense as the lessepsian movement the process may be scientific interest and may therefore warrant increased levels of monitoring.nnsea-level riseeditnby 2100 the overall level of the mediterranean could rise between 3 to 61 cm 1.2 to 24.0 in as a result of the effects of climate change this could have adverse effects on populations across the mediterranean:nnncoastal ecosystems also appear to be threatened by sea level rise especially enclosed seas such as the baltic the mediterranean and the black sea these seas have only small and primarily east-west movement corridors which may restrict northward displacement of organisms in these areas sea level rise for the next century 2100 could be between 30 cm 12 in and 100 cm 39 in and temperature shifts of a mere 0.050.1 c in the deep sea are sufficient to induce significant changes in species richness and functional diversity.nnpollutioneditnpollution in this region has been extremely high in recent years the united nations environment programme has estimated that 650,000,000 t 720,000,000 short tons of sewage 129,000 t 142,000 short tons of mineral oil 60,000 t 66,000 short tons of mercury 3,800 t 4,200 short tons of lead and 36,000 t 40,000 short tons of phosphates are dumped into the mediterranean each year the barcelona convention aims to reduce pollution in the mediterranean sea and protect and improve the marine environment in the area thereby contributing to its sustainable development.nmany marine species have been almost wiped out because of the seas pollution one of them is the mediterranean monk seal which is considered to be among the worlds most endangered marine mammals.nthe mediterranean is also plagued by marine debris a 1994 study of the seabed using trawl nets around the coasts of spain france and italy reported a particularly high mean concentration of debris an average of 1,935 items per km plastic debris accounted for 76 of which 94 was plastic bags.nnshippingeditn a cargo ship cruises towards the strait of messinansome of the worlds busiest shipping routes are in the mediterranean sea it is estimated that approximately 220,000 merchant vessels of more than 100 tonnes cross the mediterranean sea each yearabout one third of the worlds total merchant shipping these ships often carry hazardous cargo which if lost would result in severe damage to the marine environment.nthe discharge of chemical tank washings and oily wastes also represent a significant source of marine pollution the mediterranean sea constitutes 0.7 of the global water surface and yet receives 17 of global marine oil pollution it is estimated that every year between 100,000 t 98,000 long tons and 150,000 t 150,000 long tons of crude oil are deliberately released into the sea from shipping activities.napproximately 370,000,000 t 360,000,000 long tons of oil are transported annually in the mediterranean sea more than 20 of the world total with around 250300 oil tankers crossing the sea every day accidental oil spills happen frequently with an average of 10 spills per year a major oil spill could occur at any time in any part of the mediterranean.nntourismeditn antalya on the turkish riviera turquoise coast received more than 11 million international tourist arrivals in 2014.nthe mediterranean sea is arguably among the most culturally diverse block basin sea regions in the world with a unique combination of pleasant climate beautiful coastline rich history and various cultures the mediterranean region is the most popular tourist destination in the worldattracting approximately one third of the worlds international tourists.ntourism is one of the most important sources of income for many mediterranean countries regardless of the man-made geopolitical conflicts that harbour coastal nations in that regard authorities around the mediterranean have made it a point to extinguish rising man-made chaotic zones that would affect the economies societies in neighboring coastal countries let alone shipping routes naval and rescue components in the mediterranean sea are considered one of the very best due to the quick intercooperation of various naval fleets within proximity of each other unlike the vast open oceans the closed nature of the mediterranean sea provides a much more adaptable naval initiative among the coastal countries to provide effective naval and rescue missions considered the safest and regardless of any man-made or natural disaster.ntourism also supports small communities in coastal areas and islands by providing alternative sources of income far from urban centers however tourism has also played major role in the degradation of the coastal and marine environment rapid development has been encouraged by mediterranean governments to support the large numbers of tourists visiting the region each year but this has caused serious disturbance to marine habitats such as erosion and pollution in many places along the mediterranean coasts.ntourism often concentrates in areas of high natural wealth causing a serious threat to the habitats of endangered mediterranean species such as sea turtles and monk seals reductions in natural wealth may reduce incentives for tourists to visit.nnsee also

marlin swordfish red mullet and sea breamare threatened.nthere are clear indications that catch size and quality have declined often dramatically and in many areas larger and longer-lived species have disappeared entirely from commercial catches.nlarge open water fish like tuna have been a shared fisheries resource for thousands of years but the stocks are now dangerously low in 1999 greenpeace published a report revealing that the amount of bluefin tuna in the mediterranean had decreased by over 80 in the previous 20 years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse.nngalleryeditnnsee alsoeditnnnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnmediterranean seaat wikipedias sister projectsnnnnnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
