so-called earth ellipsoid red shows the areas where gravity is stronger than the smooth standard value and blue reveals areas where gravity is weaker animated version.nthe gravity of earth denoted by g is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation from distribution of mass within earth and the centrifugal force from the earths rotation.nin si units this acceleration is measured in metres per second squared in symbols m/s or ms or equivalently in newtons per kilogram n/kg or nkg near earths surface gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s which means that ignoring the effects of air resistance the speed of an object falling freely will increase by about 9.8 metres per second every second this quantity is sometimes referred to informally as little g in contrast the gravitational constant g is referred to as big g.nthe precise strength of earths gravity varies depending on location the nominal average value at earths surface known as standard gravity is by definition 9.80665 m/s this quantity is denoted variously as g g though this sometimes means the normal equatorial value on earth 9.78033 m/s g gee or simply g which is also used for the variable local value nthe weight of an object on earths surface is the downwards force on that object given by newtons second law of motion or f ma force mass acceleration gravitational acceleration contributes to the total gravity acceleration but other factors such as the rotation of earth also contribute and therefore affect the weight of the object.ngravity does not normally include the gravitational pull of the moon and sun which are accounted for in terms of tidal effects.nit is a vector physics quantity whose direction coincides with a plumb bob.nncontentsnnnvariation in magnitudeeditna non-rotating perfect sphere of uniform mass density or whose density varies solely with distance from the centre spherical symmetry would produce a gravitational field of uniform magnitude at all points on its surface the earth is rotating and is also not spherically symmetric rather it is slightly flatter at the poles while bulging at the equator an oblate spheroid there are consequently slight deviations in the magnitude of gravity across its surface.ngravity on the earths surface varies by around 0.7 from 9.7639 m/s on the nevado huascarn mountain in peru to 9.8337 m/s at the surface of the arctic ocean in large cities it ranges from 9.7760 in kuala lumpur mexico city and singapore to 9.825 in oslo and helsinki.nnconventional valueeditnin 1901 the third general conference on weights and measures defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the earth g 9.80665 m/s it was based on measurements done at the pavillon de breteuil near paris in 1888 with a theoretical correction applied in order to convert to a latitude of 45 at sea level this definition is thus not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important it is also used to define the units kilogram force and pound force.nnlatitudeeditn the differences of earths gravity around the antarctic continent.nthe surface of the earth is rotating so it is not an inertial frame of reference at latitudes nearer the equator the outward centrifugal force produced by earths rotation is larger than at polar latitudes this counteracts the earths gravity to a small degree up to a maximum of 0.3 at the equator and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of falling objects.nthe second major reason for the difference in gravity at different latitudes is that the earths equatorial bulge itself also caused by centrifugal force from rotation causes objects at the equator to be farther from the planets centre than objects at the poles because the force due to gravitational attraction between two bodies the earth and the object being weighed varies inversely with the square of the distance between them an object at the equator experiences a weaker gravitational pull than an object at the poles.nin combination the equatorial bulge and the effects of the surface centrifugal force due to rotation mean that sea-level gravity increases from about 9.780 m/s at the equator to about 9.832 m/s at the poles so an object will weigh approximately 0.5 more at the poles than at the equator.nnaltitudeeditn the graph shows the variation in gravity relative to the height of an object above the surfacengravity decreases with altitude as one rises above the earths surface because greater altitude means greater distance from the earths centre all other things being equal an increase in altitude from sea level to 9,000 metres 30,000 ft causes a weight decrease of about 0.29 an additional factor affecting apparent weight is the decrease in air density at altitude which lessens an objects buoyancy this would increase a persons apparent weight at an altitude of 9,000 metres by about 0.08%nit is a common misconception that astronauts in orbit are weightless because they have flown high enough to escape the earths gravity in fact at an altitude of 400 kilometres 250 mi equivalent to a typical orbit of the iss gravity is still nearly 90 as strong as at the earths surface weightlessness actually occurs because orbiting objects are in free-fall.nthe effect of ground elevation depends on the density of the ground see slab correction section a person flying at 30 000 ft above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea however a person standing on the earths surface feels less gravity when the elevation is higher.nthe following formula approximates the earths gravity variation with altitude:nnnwherennnthe formula treats the earth as a perfect sphere with a radially symmetric distribution of mass a more accurate mathematical treatment is discussed below.nndeptheditnsee also shell theoremnan approximate value for gravity at a distance r from the center of the earth can be obtained by assuming that the earths density is spherically symmetric the gravity depends only on the mass inside the sphere of radius r all the contributions from outside cancel out as a consequence of the inverse-square law of gravitation another consequence is that the gravity is the same as if all the mass were concentrated at the center thus the gravitational acceleration at this radius isnnnwhere g is the gravitational constant and mr is the total mass enclosed

bennnthe actual depth dependence of density and gravity inferred from seismic travel times see adamswilliamson equation is shown in the graphs below.nnnlocal topography and geologyeditnsee also physical geodesynlocal differences in topography such as the presence of mountains geology such as the density of rocks in the vicinity and deeper tectonic structure cause local and regional differences in the earths gravitational field known as gravitational anomalies some of these anomalies can be very extensive resulting in bulges in sea level and throwing pendulum clocks out of synchronisation.nthe study of these anomalies forms the basis of gravitational geophysics the fluctuations are measured with highly sensitive gravimeters the effect of topography and other known factors is subtracted and from the resulting data conclusions are drawn such techniques are now used by prospectors to find oil and mineral deposits denser rocks often containing mineral ores cause higher than normal local gravitational fields on the earths surface less dense sedimentary rocks cause the opposite.nnother factorseditnin air or water objects experience a supporting buoyancy force which reduces the apparent strength of gravity as measured by an objects weight the magnitude of the effect depends on the air density and hence air pressure or the water density respectively see apparent weight for details.nthe gravitational effects of the moon and the sun also the cause of the tides have a very small effect on the apparent strength of earths gravity depending on their relative positions typical variations are 2 m/s 0.2 mgal over the course of a day.nnvariation in directioneditngravity acceleration is a vector quantity in a spherically symmetric earth gravity would point directly towards the spheres centre as the earth is slightly flatter there are consequently slight deviations in the direction of gravity.nncomparative values worldwideeditntools exist for calculating the strength of gravity at various cities around the world the effect of latitude can be clearly seen with gravity in high-latitude cities anchorage 9.826 m/s helsinki 9.825 m/s being about 0.5 greater than that in cities near the equator kuala lumpur 9.776 m/s manila 9.780 m/s the effect of altitude can be seen in mexico city 9.776 m/s altitude 2,240 metres 7,350 ft and by comparing denver 9.798 m/s 1,616 metres 5,302 ft with washington d.c 9.801 m/s 30 metres 98 ft both of which are near 39 n measured values can be obtained from physical and mathematical tables by t.m yarwood and f castle macmillan revised edition 1970.nnmathematical modelseditnlatitude modeleditnmain article theoretical gravitynif the terrain is at sea level we can estimate the acceleration at latitude nnnthis is the international gravity formula 1967 the 1967 geodetic reference system formula helmerts equation or clairauts formula.nan alternative formula for g as a function of latitude is the wgs world geodetic system 84 ellipsoidal gravity formula:nnnwhere,nnnthen where nnnthe difference between the wgs-84 formula and helmerts equation is less than 0.68 ms.nnfree air correctioneditnmain article free-air anomalynthe first correction to be applied to the model is the free air correction fac that accounts for heights above sea level near the surface of the earth sea level gravity decreases with height such that linear extrapolation would give zero gravity at a height of one half of the earths radius 9.8 ms per 3,200 km.nusing the mass and radius of the earth:nnnthe fac correction factor g can be derived from the definition of the acceleration due to gravity in terms of g the gravitational constant see estimating g from the law of universal gravitation below:nnnwhere:nnnat a height h above the nominal surface of the earth g is given by:nnnso the fac for a height h above the nominal earth radius can be expressed:nnnthis expression can be readily used for programming or inclusion in a spreadsheet collecting terms simplifying and neglecting small terms hr however yields the good approximation:nnnusing the numerical values above and for a height h in metres:nnngrouping the latitude and fac altitude factors the expression most commonly found in the literature is:nnnwhere acceleration in ms at latitude and altitude h in metres.nnslab correctioneditnmain article bouguer anomalynnfor flat terrain above sea level a second term is added for the gravity due to the extra mass for this purpose the extra mass can be approximated by an infinite horizontal slab and we get 2g times the mass per unit area i.e 4.210 mskg 0.042 galkgm the bouguer correction for a mean rock density of 2.67 gcm this gives 1.110 s 0.11 mgalm combined with the free-air correction this means a reduction of gravity at the surface of ca 2 ms 0.20 mgal for every metre of elevation of the terrain the two effects would cancel at a surface rock density of 4/3 times the average density of the whole earth the density of the whole earth is 5.515 gcm so standing on a slab of something like iron whose density is over 7.35 gcm would increase ones weight.nfor the gravity below the surface we have to apply the free-air correction as well as a double bouguer correction with the infinite slab model this is because moving the point of observation below the slab changes the gravity due to it to its opposite alternatively we can consider a spherically symmetrical earth and subtract from the mass of the earth that of the shell outside the point of observation because that does not cause gravity inside this gives the same result.nnestimating g from the law of universal gravitationeditnfrom the law of universal gravitation the force on a body acted upon by earths gravity is given bynnnwhere r is the distance between the centre of the earth and the body see below and here we take m to be the mass of the earth and m to be the mass of the body.nadditionally newtons second law f ma where m is mass and a is acceleration here tells us thatnnncomparing the two formulas it is seen that:nnnso to find the acceleration due to gravity at sea level substitute the values of the gravitational constant g the earths mass in kilograms m and the earths radius in metres r to obtain the value of g:nnnnote that this formula only works because of the mathematical fact that the gravity of a uniform spherical body as measured on or above its surface is the same as if all its mass were concentrated at a point at its centre this is what allows us to use the earths radius for r.nthe value obtained agrees approximately with the measured value of g the difference may be attributed to several factors mentioned above under variations":nnnthere are significant uncertainties in the values of r and m as used in this calculation and the value of g is also rather difficult to measure precisely.nif g g and r are known then a reverse calculation will give an estimate of the mass of the earth this method was used by henry cavendish.nnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
