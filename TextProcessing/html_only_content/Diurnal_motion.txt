diurnal motion wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnndiurnal motion latin diurnus lit daily from dies lit day is an astronomical term referring to the apparent motion of celestial objects e.g the sun and stars around earth or more precisely around the two celestial poles over the course of one day it is caused by earths rotation around its axis so almost every star appears to follow a circular arc path called the diurnal circle.nthe time for one complete rotation is 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.09 seconds one sidereal day the first experimental demonstration of this motion was conducted by lon foucault.nnrelative directioneditnthe relative direction of diurnal motion in the northern celestial hemisphere are as follows:nnnthus northern circumpolar stars move counterclockwise around polaris the north pole star.nat the north pole the cardinal directions do not apply to diurnal motion within the circumpolar circle all the stars move simply rightward or looking directly overhead counterclockwise around the zenith where polaris is.nsouthern celestial hemisphere observers are to replace north with south left with right and polaris with sigma octantis sometimes called the south pole star the circumpolar stars move clockwise around sigma octantis east and west are not interchanged.nas seen from the equator the two celestial poles are on the horizon due north and south and the motion is counterclockwise i.e leftward around polaris and clockwise i.e rightward around sigma octantis all motion is westward except for the two fixed points.nnapparent speededitnthe daily arc path of an object on the celestial sphere including the possible part below the horizon has a length proportional to the cosine of the declination thus the speed of the diurnal motion of a celestial object equals this cosine times 15 per hour 15 arcminutes per minute or 15 arcseconds per second.nper a certain period of time a given angular distance traveled by an object along or near the celestial equator may be compared to the angular diameter of one of the following objects:nnnstar trail and time-lapse photography capture diurnal motion blur the apparent motion of stars near the celestial pole seems slower than that of stars closer to the celestial equator conversely following the diurnal motion with the camera to eliminate its arcing effect on a long exposure can best be done with an equatorial mount which requires adjusting the right ascension only a telescope may have a sidereal motor drive to do that automatically.nnreferenceseditnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
