biopan wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn foton-12 capsule on displayn experiment biopan-5 part of the foton-m2 missionnbiopan is a multi-user research program by the european space agency esa designed to investigate the effect of the space environment on biological material the experiments in biopan are exposed to solar and cosmic radiation the space vacuum and weightlessness or a selection thereof optionally the experiment temperature can be stabilized biopan hosts astrobiology radiobiology and materials science experiments.nthe biopan facility is installed on the external surface of russian foton descent capsules protruding from the thermal blanket that envelops the satellite.nncontentsnnndesign and featureseditnthe biopan program started in the early nineties with an esa contract for the a joint development by kayser-threde and kayser italia it was based on the heritage of a low-tech russian exposure container called kna kontejner nauchnoj apparatury the biopan facilities are installed on the external surface of foton descent capsules it has a motor-driven hinged lid which opens 180 in earth orbit to expose the experiment samples to the harsh space environment for re-entry the closed facility is protected with an ablative heat shield.nthe biopan facilities are equipped with thermometers uv sensors a radiometer a pressure sensor and an active radiation dosimeter data acquired by the sensors is stored by biopan throughout each mission and can be accessed after flight the possibility of overheating during atmospheric re-entry was acknowledged early during the development therefore a quite massive heat shield was designed for it while the total weight of biopan is close to 27 kg including the experiments the heat shield is responsible for 12 kg of that figure.nthe biopan electronics consists of the following units signal acquisition board microcontroller board with its flight software memory board and egse.nnmissionseditnthe missions flown so far are:nnnnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
