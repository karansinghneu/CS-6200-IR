pacific ocean and to the southeast by south america and the caribbean sea.nnorth america covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers 9,540,000 square miles about 16.5 of the earths land area and about 4.8 of its total surface.nnorth america is the third largest continent by area following asia and africa and the fourth by population after asia africa and europe in 2013 its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in 23 independent states or about 7.5 of the worlds population if nearby islands most notably the caribbean are included.nnorth america was reached by its first human populations during the last glacial period via crossing the bering land bridge approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago the so-called paleo-indian period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago the beginning of the archaic or meso-indian period the classic stage spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries the pre-columbian era ended in 1492 and the transatlantic migrationsthe arrival of european settlers during the age of discovery and the early modern period present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kinds of interactions between european colonists indigenous peoples african slaves and their descendants.nowing to the european colonization of the americas most north americans speak english spanish or french and their culture commonly reflects

vespucci by the german cartographers martin waldseemller and matthias ringmann vespucci who explored south america between 1497 and 1502 was the first european to suggest that the americas were not the east indies but a different landmass previously unknown by europeans in 1507 waldseemller produced a world map in which he placed the word america on the continent of south america in the middle of what is today brazil he explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book cosmographiae introductio:nn ab americo inventore quasi americi terram sive americam from americus the discoverer as if it were the land of americus thus america.nfor waldseemller no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer he used the latinized version of vespuccis name americus vespucius but in its feminine form america following the examples of europa asia and africa later other mapmakers extended the name america to the northern continent in 1538 gerard mercator used america on his map of the world for all the western hemisphere.nsome argue that because the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty the derivation from amerigo vespucci could be put in question in 1874 thomas belt proposed a derivation from the amerrique mountains of central america the next year jules marcou suggested that the name of the mountain range stemmed from indigenous american languages marcou corresponded with augustus le plongeon who wrote the name america or amerrique in the mayan language means a country of perpetually strong wind or the land of the wind and the suffixes can mean a spirit that breathes life itself."nnextentnthe united nations formally recognizes north america as comprising three areas northern

the late paleozoic to early mesozoic eras north america was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent pangaea with eurasia to its east one of the results of the formation of pangaea was the appalachian mountains which formed some 480 million years ago making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world when pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago north america became part of laurasia before it separated from eurasia as its own continent during the mid-cretaceous period the rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the laramide orogeny between 80 and 55 million years ago the formation of the isthmus of panama that connected the continent to south america arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 million years ago and the great lakes as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.nnorth america

the first american inhabitants sailed from beringia some 13,000 years ago with widespread habitation of the americas during the end of the last glacial period in what is known as the late glacial maximum around 12,500 years ago the oldest petroglyphs in north america date from 15,000 to 10,000 years before present genetic research and anthropology indicate additional waves of migration from

large empires they lived in several culture areas which roughly correspond to geographic and biological zones and give a good indication of the main way of life of the people who lived there e.g the bison hunters of the great plains or the farmers of mesoamerica native groups can also be classified by their language family e.g athapascan or uto-aztecan peoples with similar languages did not always share the same material culture nor were they always allies anthropologists think that the inuit people of the high arctic came to north america much later than other native groups as evidenced by the disappearance of dorset culture artifacts from the archaeological record and their replacement by the thule people.nduring the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent cultures
