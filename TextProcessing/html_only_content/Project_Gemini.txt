project gemini wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnasas second human spaceflight programnnnnnproject gemini was nasas second human spaceflight program conducted between projects mercury and apollo gemini started in 1961 and concluded in 1966 the gemini spacecraft carried a two-astronaut crew ten gemini crews flew low earth orbit leo missions during 1965 and 1966 putting the united states in the lead during the cold war space race against the soviet union.ngeminis objective was the development of space travel techniques to support the apollo mission to land astronauts on the moon it performed missions long enough for a trip to the moon and back perfected working outside the spacecraft with extra-vehicular activity eva and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking with these new techniques proven by gemini apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations.nall gemini flights were launched from launch complex 19 lc-19 at cape kennedy air force station in florida their launch vehicle was the geminititan ii a modified intercontinental ballistic missile icbm gemini was the first program to use the newly built mission control center at the houston manned spacecraft center for flight control.nthe astronaut corps that supported project gemini included the mercury seven the new nine and the 1963 astronaut class during the program three astronauts died in air crashes during training including the prime crew for gemini 9 this mission was flown by the backup crew the only time that has happened in nasas history to date.ngemini was robust enough that the united states air force planned to use it for the manned orbital laboratory mol program which was later canceled geminis chief designer jim chamberlin also made detailed plans for cislunar and lunar landing missions in late 1961 he believed that gemini spacecraft could fly in lunar operations before project apollo and cost less nasas administration did not approve those plans in 1969 mcdonnell-douglas proposed a big gemini that could have been used to shuttle up to 12 astronauts to the planned space stations in the apollo applications project aap the only aap project funded was skylab which used existing spacecraft and hardware thereby eliminating the need for big gemini.nncontentsnnnpronunciationeditnthe constellation for which the project was named is commonly pronounced dmna the last syllable rhyming with eye however staff of the manned spacecraft center including the astronauts tended to pronounce the name dmni rhyming with knee nasas public affairs office issued a statement in 1965 declaring jeh-mih-nee to be the official pronunciation gus grissom acting as houston capsule communicator when ed white performed his spacewalk on gemini 4 is heard on flight recordings pronouncing the spacecrafts call sign jeh-mih-nee 4 and the nasa pronunciation is used in the movie first man.nnprogram origins and objectiveseditnthe apollo program was conceived in early 1960 as a three-man spacecraft to follow project mercury jim chamberlin the head of engineering at the space task group stg was assigned in february 1961 to start working on a bridge program between mercury and apollo he presented two initial versions of a two-man spacecraft then designated mercury mark ii at a nasa retreat at wallops island in march 1961 scale models were shown in july 1961 at the mcdonnell aircraft corporations offices in st louis.nafter apollo was chartered to land men on the moon by president john f kennedy on may 25 1961 it became evident to nasa officials that a follow-on to the mercury program was required to develop certain spaceflight capabilities in support of apollo nasa approved the two-man program rechristened project gemini latin for twins in reference to the third constellation of the zodiac with its twin stars castor and pollux on december 7 1961 mcdonnell aircraft was contracted to build it on december 22 1961 the program was publicly announced on january 3 1962 with these major objectives:nnnteameditnthe canadian jim chamberlin designed the gemini capsule which carried a crew of two he was previously the chief aerodynamicist on avro canadas avro arrow fighter interceptor program chamberlin joined nasa along with 25 senior avro engineers after cancellation of the arrow program and became head of the u.s space task groups engineering division in charge of gemini the prime contractor was mcdonnell aircraft corporation which was also the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule.nastronaut gus grissom was heavily involved in the development and design of the gemini spacecraft what other mercury astronauts dubbed gusmobile was so designed around grissoms 56 body that when nasa discovered in 1963 that 14 of 16 astronauts would not fit in the spacecraft the interior had to be redesigned grissom wrote in his posthumous 1968 book gemini that the realization of project mercurys end and the unlikelihood of his having another flight in that program prompted him to focus all of his efforts on the upcoming gemini program.nthe gemini program was managed by the manned spacecraft center located in houston texas under direction of the office of manned space flight nasa headquarters washington d.c dr george e mueller associate administrator of nasa for manned space flight served as acting director of the gemini program william c schneider deputy director of manned space flight for mission operations served as mission director on all gemini flights beginning with gemini 6a.nguenter wendt was a mcdonnell engineer who supervised launch preparations for both the mercury and gemini programs and would go on to do the same when the apollo program launched crews his team was responsible for completion of the complex pad close-out procedures just prior to spacecraft launch and he was the last person the astronauts would see prior to closing the hatch the astronauts appreciated his taking absolute authority over and responsibility for the condition of the spacecraft and developed a good-humored rapport with him.nnspacecrafteditn a cutaway illustration of the gemini spacecraftnnasa selected mcdonnell aircraft which had been the prime contractor for the project mercury capsule in 1961 to build the gemini capsule the first of which was delivered in 1963 the spacecraft was 18 feet 5 inches 5.61 m long and 10 feet 3.0 m wide with a launch weight varying from 7,100 to 8,350 pounds 3,220 to 3,790 kg.nthe gemini crew capsule referred to as the reentry module was essentially an enlarged version of the mercury capsule unlike mercury the retrorockets electrical power propulsion systems oxygen and water were located in a detachable adapter module behind the reentry module a major design improvement in gemini was to locate all internal spacecraft systems in modular components which could be independently tested and replaced when necessary without removing or disturbing other already tested components.nn unablated gemini heat shieldn ablated gemini heat shieldnreentry moduleeditnmany components in the capsule itself were reachable through their own small access doors unlike mercury gemini used completely solid-state electronics and its modular design made it easy to repair.ngeminis emergency launch escape system did not use an escape tower powered by a solid-fuel rocket but instead used aircraft-style ejection seats the tower was heavy and complicated and nasa engineers reasoned that they could do away with it as the titan iis hypergolic propellants would burn immediately on contact a titan ii booster explosion had a smaller blast effect and flame than on the cryogenically fueled atlas and saturn ejection seats were sufficient to separate the astronauts from a malfunctioning launch vehicle at higher altitudes where the ejection seats could not be used the astronauts would return inside the spacecraft which would separate from the launch vehicle.nthe main proponent of using ejection seats was james chamberlin head of the engineering division of nasas space force task group chamberlin had never liked the mercury escape tower and wished to use a simpler alternative that would also reduce weight he reviewed several films of atlas and titan ii icbm failures which he used to estimate the approximate size of a fireball produced by an exploding launch vehicle and from this he gauged that the titan ii would produce a much smaller explosion thus the spacecraft could get away with ejection seats.nmaxime faget the designer of the mercury les was on the other hand less-than-enthusiastic about this setup aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts they would also only be usable for about 40 seconds after liftoff by which point the booster would be attaining mach 1 speed and ejection would no longer be possible he was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the titans exhaust plume if they ejected in-flight and later added that the best thing about gemini was that they never had to make an escape."ngemini was the first astronaut-carrying spacecraft to include an onboard computer the gemini guidance computer to facilitate management and control of mission maneuvers this computer sometimes called the gemini spacecraft on-board computer obc was very similar to the saturn launch vehicle digital computer the gemini guidance computer weighed 58.98 pounds 26.75 kg its core memory had 4096 addresses each containing a 39-bit word composed of three 13-bit syllables all numeric data was 26-bit twos-complement integers sometimes used as fixed-point numbers either stored in the first two syllables of a word or in the accumulator instructions always with a 4-bit opcode and 9 bits of operand could go in any syllable.nunlike mercury gemini used in-flight radar and an artificial horizon similar to those used in the aviation industry astronauts had no control over mercurys flight path and computers flew most of apollo missions gemini crew had full manual control with control sticks for yaw pitch and roll and forward or backward.nn gemini paraglider during tests at edwards air force base in august 1964.nthe original intention for gemini was to land on solid ground instead of at sea using a rogallo wing rather than a parachute with the crew seated upright controlling the forward motion of the craft to facilitate this the airfoil did not attach just to the nose of the craft but to an additional attachment point for balance near the heat shield this cord was covered by a strip of metal which ran between the twin hatches this design was ultimately dropped and parachutes were used to make a sea landing as in mercury the capsule was suspended at an angle closer to horizontal so that a side of the heat shield contacted the water first this eliminated the need for the landing bag cushion used in the mercury capsule.nnadapter moduleeditnthe adapter module in turn was separated into a retro module and an equipment module.nnretro moduleeditnthe retro module contained four solid-fuel te-m-385 star-13e retrorockets each spherical in shape except for its rocket nozzle which were structurally attached to two beams that reached across the diameter of the retro module crossing at right angles in the center re-entry began with the retrorockets firing one at a time abort procedures at certain periods during lift-off would cause them to fire at the same time thrusting the descent module away from the titan rocket.nnequipment moduleeditngemini was equipped with an orbit attitude and maneuvering system oams containing sixteen thrusters for translation control in all three perpendicular axes forward/backward left/right up/down in addition to attitude control pitch yaw and roll angle orientation as in mercury translation control allowed changing orbital inclination and altitude necessary to perform space rendezvous with other craft and docking with the agena target vehicle atv with its own rocket engine which could be used to perform greater orbit changes.nearly short-duration missions had their electrical power supplied by batteries later endurance missions used the first fuel cells in manned spacecraft.ngemini was in some regards more advanced than apollo because the latter program began almost a year earlier it became known as a pilots spacecraft due to its assortment of jet fighter-like features in no small part due to gus grissoms influence over the design and it was at this point where the american manned space program clearly began showing its superiority over that of the soviet union with long duration flight rendezvous and extravehicular capability the soviet union during this period was developing the soyuz spacecraft intended to take cosmonauts to the moon but political and technical problems began to get in the way leading to the ultimate end of their manned lunar program.nnlaunch vehicleeditnmain article titan ii glvnthe titan ii had debuted in 1962 as the air forces second-generation icbm to replace the atlas by using hypergolic fuels it could be stored for long periods of time and be easily readied for launch in addition to being a simpler design with fewer components the only caveat being that the propellant mix nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine was extremely toxic compared to the atlass liquid oxygen/rp-1 however the titan had considerable difficulty being man-rated due to early problems with pogo oscillation the launch vehicle used a radio guidance system that was unique to launches from cape kennedy.nnastronautseditn astronauts white and mcdivitt inside the gemini 4 spacecraft 1965n gemini 8 prime crew and other astronauts

alan shepard grissom cooper and schirra john glenn had retired from nasa in january 1964 and scott carpenter who was blamed by some in nasa management for the problematic reentry of aurora 7 was on

schirra and young for gemini 5 which was to be the first agena rendezvous mission the backup crew for gemini 3 was grissom and borman who were also slated for gemini 6 to be the first long-duration mission finally conrad and lovell were assigned as the backup crew for gemini 4.ndelays in the production of the agena target vehicle caused the first rearrangement of the crew rotation the schirra and young mission was bumped to gemini 6 and they became the backup crew for shepard and stafford grissom and borman then had their long-duration mission assigned to gemini 5.nthe second rearrangement occurred when shepard developed mnires disease an inner ear problem grissom was then moved to command gemini 3 slayton felt that young was a better personality match with grissom and switched stafford and young finally slayton tapped cooper to command the long-duration gemini 5 again for reasons of compatibility he moved conrad from backup commander of gemini 4 to pilot of gemini 5 and borman to backup command of gemini 4 finally he assigned armstrong and elliot see to be the backup crew for gemini 5.nthe third rearrangement of crew assignment occurred when slayton felt that see wasnt up to the physical demands of eva on gemini 8 he reassigned see to be the prime commander of gemini 9 and put scott as pilot of gemini 8 and charles bassett as the pilot of gemini 9.nthe fourth and final rearrangement of the gemini crew assignment occurred after the deaths of see and bassett when their trainer jet crashed coincidentally into a mcdonnell building which held their gemini 9 capsule in st louis the backup crew of stafford and cernan was then moved up to the new prime crew of the re-designated gemini 9a lovell and aldrin were moved from being the backup crew of gemini 10 to be the backup crew of gemini 9 this cleared the way through the crew rotation for lovell and aldrin to become the prime crew of gemini 12.nalong with the deaths of grissom white and roger chaffee in the fire of apollo 1 this final arrangement helped determine the makeup of the first seven apollo crews and who would be in position for a chance to be the first to walk on the moon.nnmissionseditn gemini mission control in houston during gemini 5nin 1964 and 1965 two gemini missions were flown without crews to test out systems and the heat shield these were followed by ten flights with crews in 1965 and 1966 all were launched by titan ii launch vehicles some highlights from the gemini program:nnnrendezvous in orbit is not a straightforward maneuver should a spacecraft increase its speed to catch up with another the result is that it goes into a higher and slower orbit and the distance thereby increases the right procedure is to go to a lower orbit first and which increases relative speed and then approach the target spacecraft from below and decrease orbital speed to meet it to practice these maneuvers special rendezvous and docking simulators were built for the astronauts.nnnngemini-titan launches and serial numberseditnmain article titan ii glvnleft all gemini launches from gt-1 through gt-12 right usaf serial number location on titan iinthe gemini-titan ii launch vehicle was adapted by nasa from the u.s air force titan ii icbm similarly the mercury-atlas launch vehicle had been adapted from the usaf atlas missile the gemini-titan ii rockets were assigned air force serial numbers which were painted in four places on each titan ii on opposite sides on each of the first and second stages usaf crews maintained launch complex 19 and prepared and launched all of the gemini-titan ii launch vehicles data and experience operating the titans was of value to both the u.s air force and nasa.nthe usaf serial numbers assigned to the gemini-titan launch vehicles are given in the tables above fifteen titan iis were ordered in 1962 so the serial is 62-12xxx but only 12xxx is painted on the titan ii the order for the last three of the 15 launch vehicles was canceled on july 30 1964 and they were never built serial numbers were however assigned to them prospectively 12568 glv-13 12569 glv-14 and 12570 glv-15.nnprogram costeditnfrom 1962 to 1967 gemini cost 1.3 billion in 1967 dollars 7.32 billion in 2016 in january 1969 a nasa report to the us congress estimating the costs for mercury gemini and apollo through the first manned moon landing included 1.2834 billion for gemini 797.4 million for spacecraft 409.8 million for launch vehicles and 76.2 million for support.nncurrent location of hardwareeditnspacecrafteditnntrainerseditn gemini ttv-1 paraglider capsulennproposed extensions and applicationseditnadvanced geminieditnmain article advanced gemininmcdonnell aircraft the main contractor for mercury and gemini was also one of the original bidders on the prime contract for apollo but lost out to north american aviation mcdonnell later sought to extend the gemini program by proposing a derivative which could be used to fly a cislunar mission and even achieve a manned lunar landing earlier and at less cost than apollo but these proposals were rejected by nasa.na range of applications were considered for advanced gemini missions including military flights space station crew and logistics delivery and lunar flights the lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems developed for the agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the centaur which could propel the spacecraft to the moon to complete modifications of the gemini to enable it to land on the lunar surface its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before apollo was ready to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded apollo crews or even replacing the apollo program.nsome of the advanced gemini proposals used off-the-shelf gemini spacecraft unmodified from the original program while others featured modifications to allow the spacecraft to carry more crew dock with space stations visit the moon and perform other mission objectives other modifications considered included the addition of wings or a parasail to the spacecraft in order to enable it to make a horizontal landing.nnbig geminieditnmain article big gemininbig gemini or big g was another proposal by mcdonnell douglas made in august 1969 it was intended to provide large-capacity all-purpose access to space including missions that ultimately used apollo or the space shuttle.nthe study was performed to generate a preliminary definition of a logistic spacecraft derived from gemini that would be used to resupply an orbiting space station land-landing at a preselected site and refurbishment and reuse were design requirements two baseline spacecraft were defined a nine-man minimum modification version of the gemini b called min-mod big g and a 12-man advanced concept having the same exterior geometry but with new state-of-the-art subsystems called advanced big g three launch vehicles-saturn ib titan iiim and saturn int-20 s-ic/s-ivb were investigated for use with the spacecraft.nnmilitary applicationseditnthe air force had an interest in the gemini system and decided to use its own modification of the spacecraft as the crew vehicle for the manned orbital laboratory to this end the gemini 2 spacecraft was refurbished and flown again atop a mockup of the mol sent into space by a titan iiic this was the first time a spacecraft went into space twice.nthe usaf also had the notion of adapting the gemini spacecraft for military applications such as crude observation of the ground no specialized reconnaissance camera could be carried and practicing making rendezvous with suspicious satellites this project was called blue gemini the usaf did not like the fact that gemini would have to be recovered by the us navy so they intended for blue gemini eventually to use the airfoil and land on three skids carried over from the original design of gemini.nat first some within nasa welcomed sharing of the cost with the usaf but it was later agreed that nasa was better off operating gemini by itself blue gemini was canceled in 1963 by secretary of defense robert mcnamara who decided that the nasa gemini flights could conduct necessary military experiments mol was canceled by secretary of defense melvin laird in 1969 when it was determined that unmanned spy satellites could perform the same functions much more cost-effectively.nnin mediaeditnnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnoteseditnnncitationseditn this article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the
