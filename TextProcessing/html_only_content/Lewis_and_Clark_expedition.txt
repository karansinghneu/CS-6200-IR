cross the western portion of the united states it began near st louis made its way westward and passed through the continental divide of the americas to reach the pacific coast the corps of discovery was a selected group of us army volunteers under the command of captain meriwether lewis and his close friend second lieutenant william clark.npresident thomas jefferson commissioned the expedition shortly after the louisiana purchase in 1803 to explore and to map the newly acquired territory to find a practical route across the western half of the continent and to establish an american presence in this territory before britain and other european powers tried to claim it the campaigns secondary objectives were scientific and economic to study the areas plants animal life and geography and to establish trade with local american indian tribes the expedition returned to st louis to report its findings to jefferson with maps sketches and journals in hand.nncontentsnnnoverviewnone of thomas jeffersons goals was to find the most direct and practicable water communication across this continent for the purposes of commerce he also placed special importance on declaring us sovereignty over the land occupied by the many different indian tribes along the missouri river and getting an accurate sense of the resources in the recently completed louisiana purchase the expedition made notable contributions to science but scientific research was not the main goal of the mission.nduring the 19th century references to lewis and clark scarcely appeared in history books even during the united states centennial in 1876 and the expedition was largely forgotten lewis and clark began to gain attention around the start of the 20th century both the 1904 louisiana purchase exposition in st louis and the 1905 lewis and clark centennial exposition in portland oregon showcased them as american pioneers however the story remained relatively shallow until mid-century as a celebration of us conquest and personal adventures but more recently the expedition has been more thoroughly researched.nin 2004 a complete and reliable set of the expeditions journals was compiled by gary e moulton in the 2000s the bicentennial of the expedition further elevated popular interest in lewis and clark as of 1984 no us exploration party was more famous and no american expedition leaders are more recognizable by name.nntimelinennnnnnnpreparationsn meriwether lewis and william clarknjefferson met john ledyard in paris in the 1780s and they discussed a possible trip to the pacific northwest jefferson had also read captain james cooks a voyage to the pacific ocean london 1784 an account of cooks third voyage and le page du pratzs the history of louisiana london 1763 all of which greatly influenced his decision to send an expedition like captain cook he wished to discover a practical route through the northwest to the pacific coast alexander mackenzie had already charted a route in his quest for the pacific following the mackenzie river to the arctic ocean in 1789 mackenzie and his party were the first to cross america north of mexico to the pacific when he arrived near bella coola british columbia in 1793a dozen years before lewis and clark mackenzies accounts in voyages from montreal 1801 informed jefferson of britains intent to control the lucrative fur trade of the columbia river and convinced him of the importance of securing the territory as soon as possible.ntwo years into his presidency jefferson asked congress to fund an expedition through the louisiana territory to the pacific ocean he did not attempt to make a secret of the lewis and clark expedition from spanish french and british officials but rather claimed different reasons for the venture he used a secret message to ask for funding due to poor relations with the opposition federalist party in congress.nin 1803 jefferson commissioned the corps of discovery and named army captain meriwether lewis its leader who then selected william clark as second in command lewis demonstrated remarkable skills and potential as a frontiersman and jefferson made efforts to prepare him for the long journey ahead as the expedition was gaining approval and funding jefferson explained his choice of lewis:nnit was impossible to find a character who to a complete science in botany natural history mineralogy astronomy joined the firmness of constitution character prudence habits adapted to the woods a familiarity with the indian manners and character requisite for this undertaking all the latter qualifications capt lewis has.nin 1803 jefferson sent lewis to philadelphia to study medicinal cures under benjamin rush a physician and humanitarian he also arranged for lewis to be further educated by andrew ellicott an astronomer who instructed him in the use of the sextant and other navigational instruments lewis however was not ignorant of science and had demonstrated a marked capacity to learn especially with jefferson as his teacher at monticello jefferson possessed the largest library in the world on the subject of the geography of the north american continent and lewis had full access to it he spent time consulting maps and books and conferring with jefferson.nlewis and clark met near louisville kentucky in october 1803 at the falls of the ohio and the core nine young men were enlisted into the corps of discovery their goals were to explore the vast territory acquired by the louisiana purchase and to establish trade and us sovereignty over the indians along the missouri river jefferson also wanted to establish a us claim of discovery to the pacific northwest and oregon territory by documenting an american presence there before european nations could claim the land according to some historians jefferson understood that he would have a better claim of ownership to the pacific northwest if the team gathered scientific data on animals and plants however his main objectives were centered around finding an all-water route to the pacific coast and commerce his instructions to the expedition stated:nnthe object of your mission is to explore the missouri river such principle stream of it as by its course and communication with the waters of the pacific ocean whether the columbia oregon colorado or any other river may offer the most direct practicable water communication across this continent for the purpose of commerce.nnthe us mint prepared special silver medals with a portrait of jefferson and inscribed with a message of friendship and peace called indian peace medals the soldiers were to distribute them to the tribes that they met the expedition also prepared advanced weapons to display their military firepower among these was an austrian-made 46 caliber girandoni air rifle a repeating rifle with a 20-round tubular magazine that was powerful enough to kill a deer the expedition was prepared with flintlock firearms knives blacksmithing supplies and cartography equipment they also carried flags gift bundles medicine and other items that they would need for their journey.nthe route of lewis and clarks expedition took them up the missouri river to its headwaters then on to the pacific ocean via the columbia river and it may have been influenced by the purported transcontinental journey of moncacht-ap by the same route about a century before jefferson had a copy of le pages book in his library detailing moncacht-aps itinerary and lewis carried a copy with him during the expedition le pages description of moncacht-aps route across the continent neglects to mention the need to cross the rocky mountains and it might be the source of lewis and clarks mistaken belief that they could easily carry boats from the missouris headwaters to the westward-flowing columbia.nnnjourneyndeparturen corps of discovery meet chinooks on the lower columbia october 1805 charles marion russel c 1905nthe corps of discovery departed from camp dubois at 4 pm on may 14 1804 and met up with lewis in st charles missouri a short time later marking the beginning of the voyage to the pacific coast as of may 16 1804 the expedition had 31 members mostly us army personnel including captains sergeants and privates the corps followed the missouri river westward soon they passed la charrette the last euro-american settlement on the missouri river.nthe expedition followed the missouri through what is now kansas city missouri and omaha nebraska on august 20 1804 sergeant charles floyd died apparently from acute appendicitis he had been among the first to sign up with the corps of discovery and was the only member to die during the expedition he was buried at a bluff by the river now named after him in what is now sioux city iowa his burial site was marked with a cedar post on which was inscribed his name and day of death 1 mile 2 km up the river the expedition camped at a small river which they named floyds river during the final week of august lewis and clark reached the edge of the great plains a place abounding with elk deer bison and beavers.nthe lewis and clark expedition established relations with two dozen indian nations without whose help the expedition would have risked starvation during the harsh winters and/or become hopelessly lost in the vast ranges of the rocky mountains.nthe americans and the lakota nation whom the americans called sioux or teton-wan sioux had problems when they met and there was a concern the two sides might fight according to harry w fritz all earlier missouri river travelers had warned of this powerful and aggressive tribe determined to block free trade on the river the sioux were also expecting a retaliatory raid from the omaha indians to the south a recent sioux raid had killed 75 omaha men burned 40 lodges and taken four dozen prisoners."nn reconstruction of fort mandan lewis and clark memorial park north dakotanone of their horses disappeared and they believed the sioux were responsible afterward the two sides met and there was a disagreement and the sioux asked the men to stay or to give more gifts instead before being allowed to pass through their territory they came close to fighting several times and both sides finally backed down and the expedition continued on to arikara territory clark wrote they were warlike and were the vilest miscreants of the savage race".nin the winter of 180405 the party built fort mandan near present-day washburn north dakota just before departing on april 7 1805 the expedition sent the keelboat back to st louis with a sample of specimens some never seen before east of the mississippi one chief asked lewis and clark to provide a boat for passage through their national territory as tensions increased lewis and clark prepared to fight but the two sides fell back in the end the americans quickly continued westward upriver and camped for the winter in the mandan nations territory.nafter the expedition had set up camp nearby indians came to visit in fair numbers some staying all night for several days lewis and clark met in council with mandan chiefs here they met a french-canadian fur trapper named toussaint charbonneau and his young shoshone wife sacagawea charbonneau at this time began to serve as the expeditions translator peace was established between the expedition and the mandan chiefs with the sharing of a mandan ceremonial pipe by april 25 captain lewis wrote his progress report of the expeditions activities and observations of the indian nations they have encountered to date a statistical view of the indian nations inhabiting the territory of louisiana which outlined the names of various tribes their locations trading practices and water routes used among other things president jefferson would later present this report to congress.nthey followed the missouri to its headwaters and over the continental divide at lemhi pass in canoes they descended the mountains by the clearwater river the snake river and the columbia river past celilo falls and past what is now portland oregon at the meeting of the willamette and columbia rivers lewis and clark used william robert broughtons 1792 notes and maps to orient themselves once they reached the lower columbia river the sighting of mount hood and other stratovolcanos confirmed that the expedition had almost reached the pacific ocean.nnpacific oceannthe expedition sighted the pacific ocean for the first time on november 7 1805 arriving two weeks later the expedition faced its second bitter winter camped on the north side of the columbia river in a storm-wracked area lack of food was a major factor the elk the partys main source of food had retreated from their usual haunts into the mountains and the party was now too poor to purchase enough food from neighboring tribes on november 24 1805 the party voted to move their camp to the south side of the columbia river near modern astoria oregon sacagawea and clarks slave york were both allowed to participate in the vote so this may have been the first time in american history where a woman and a slave were allowed to vote.non the south side of the columbia river 2 miles 3 km upstream on the west side of the netul river now lewis and clark river they constructed fort clatsop they did this not just for shelter and protection but also to officially establish the american presence there with the american flag flying over the fort during the winter at fort clatsop lewis committed himself to writing he filled many pages of his journals with valuable knowledge mostly about botany because of the abundant growth and forests that covered that part of the continent the health of the men also became a problem with many suffering from colds and influenza.nnreturn tripnlewis was determined to remain at the fort until april 1 but was still anxious to move out at the earliest opportunity by march 22 the stormy weather had subsided and the following morning on march 23 1806 the journey home began the corps began their journey homeward using canoes to ascend the columbia river and later by trekking over land.nthey made their way to camp chopunnish in idaho along the north bank of the clearwater river where the members of the expedition collected 65 horses in preparation to cross the bitterroot mountains lying between modern-day idaho and western montana however the range was still covered in snow which prevented the expedition from making the crossing on april 11 while the corps was waiting for the snow to diminish lewis dog seaman was stolen by indians but was retrieved shortly worried that other such acts might follow lewis warned the chief that any other wrongdoing or mischievous acts would result in instant death.non july 3 before crossing the continental divide the corps split into two teams so lewis could explore the marias river lewis group of four met some men from the blackfeet nation during the night the blackfeet tried to steal their weapons in the struggle the soldiers killed two blackfeet men lewis george drouillard and the field brothers fled over 100 miles 160 kilometres in a day before they camped again.nmeanwhile clark had entered the crow tribes territory in the night half of clarks horses disappeared but not a single crow had been seen lewis and clark stayed separated until they reached the yellowstone and missouri rivers on august 11 as the groups reunited one of clarks hunters pierre cruzatte mistook lewis for an elk and fired injuring lewis in the thigh once together the corps was able to return home quickly via the missouri river they reached st louis on september 23 1806.nnspanish interferencenin march 1804 before the expedition began in may the spanish in new mexico learned from general james wilkinson that the americans were encroaching on territory claimed by spain after the lewis and clark

journey lewis and clark drew about 140 maps stephen ambrose says the expedition filled in the main outlines of the area.nthe expedition documented natural resources and plants that had been previously unknown to euro-americans though not to the indigenous peoples lewis and clark were the first americans to cross the continental divide and the first americans to see yellowstone enter into montana and produce an official description of these different regions their visit to the pacific northwest maps and proclamations of sovereignty with medals and flags were legal steps needed to claim title to each indigenous nations lands under the doctrine of discovery.nthe expedition was sponsored by the american philosophical society aps lewis and clark received some instruction in astronomy botany climatology ethnology geography meteorology mineralogy ornithology and zoology during the expedition they made contact with over 70 native american tribes and described more than 200 new plant and animal species.njefferson had the expedition declare sovereignty and demonstrate their military strength to ensure native tribes would be subordinate to the u.s as european colonizers did elsewhere after the expedition the maps that were produced allowed the further discovery and settlement of this vast territory in the years that followed.nin 1807 patrick gass a private in the u.s army published an account of the journey he was promoted to sergeant during the course of the expedition paul allen edited a two-volume history of the lewis and clark expedition that was published in 1814 in philadelphia but without mention of the actual author banker nicholas biddle even then the complete report was not made public until more recently the earliest authorized edition of the lewis and clark journals resides in the maureen and mike mansfield library at the university of montana.nnencounters with american indiansnone of the primary objectives of the expedition as directed by president jefferson was to observe and record the whereabouts lives activities and cultures of the various american indian tribes that inhabited the newly acquired territory and the northwest in general the expedition encountered many different tribes along the way many of whom offered their assistance providing the expedition with their knowledge of the wilderness and with the acquisition of food the expedition had blank leather-bound journals and ink for the purpose of recording such encounters as well as for scientific and geological information they were also provided with various gifts of medals ribbons needles mirrors and other articles which were intended to ease any tensions when negotiating their passage with the various indian chiefs whom they would encounter along their way.nmany of the tribes had friendly experiences with british and french fur traders in various isolated encounters along the missouri and columbia rivers and the expedition did not encounter any hostilities with the exception of the teton-sioux tribe under black buffalo and the partisan tribe on september 25 1804 both of these tribes were rivals and hoped to use the expedition to their own advantage and both demanded tribute from the expedition for their passage over the river.ncaptain lewis made his first mistake by offering the sioux chief gifts first which insulted and angered the partisan chief communication was difficult since the expeditions only sioux interpreter was pierre dorion who had stayed behind with the other party and was also involved with diplomatic affairs with another tribe consequently both chiefs were offered a few gifts but neither was satisfied at that point some of the warriors from the partisan tribe took hold of their boat and one of the oars lewis took a firm stand ordering a display of force and presenting arms captain clark brandished his sword and threatened violent reprisal just before the situation erupted into a violent confrontation black buffalo ordered his warriors to back off.nthe captains were able to negotiate their passage without further incident with the aid of better gifts and a bottle of whiskey during the next two days the expedition made camp not far from black buffalos tribe similar incidents occurred when they tried to leave but trouble was averted with gifts of tobacco.nnobservationsnas the expedition encountered the various american indian tribes during the course of their journey they observed and recorded information regarding their lifestyles customs and the social codes they lived by as directed by president jefferson by western standards the indian way of life seemed harsh and unforgiving as witnessed by members of the expedition after many encounters and camping in close proximity to the indian nations for extended periods of time during the winter months they soon learned first hand of their customs and social orders.none of the primary customs that distinguished indian cultures from those of the west was that it was customary for the men to take on two or more wives if they were able to provide for them and often took on a wife or wives who were members of the immediate family circle e.g men in the minnetareen and mandan tribes would often take on a sister for a wife chastity among women was not held in high regard infant daughters were often sold by the father to men who were grown usually for horses or mules.nthey learned that women in sioux nations were often bartered away for horses or other supplies yet this was not practiced among the shoshone nation who held their women in higher regard they witnessed that many of the indian nations were constantly at war with other tribes especially the sioux who while remaining generally friendly to the white fur traders had proudly boasted and justified the almost complete destruction of the once great cahokia nation along with the missouris illinois kaskaskia and piorias tribes that lived about the countryside adjacent to the upper mississippi and missouri rivers.nnsacagawean statue of sacagawea a shoshone woman who accompanied the lewis and clark expeditionnsacagawea sometimes called sakajawea or sakagawea c 1788 december 20 1812 was a shoshone indian woman who arrived with her husband toussaint charbonneau on the expedition to the pacific ocean.non february 11 1805 a few weeks after her first contact with the expedition sacagawea went into labor which was slow and painful so the frenchman charbonneau suggested she be given a potion of rattlesnakes rattle to aid in her delivery lewis happened to have some snakes rattle with him a short time after administering the potion she delivered a healthy boy who was given the name jean baptiste charbonneau.nwhen the expedition reached marias river on june 16 1805 sacagawea became dangerously ill she was able to find some relief by drinking mineral water from the sulphur spring that fed into the river.nthough she has been discussed in literature frequently much of the information is exaggeration or fiction scholars say she did notice some geographical features but sacagawea was not the guide for the expedition she was important to them as an interpreter and in other ways the sight of a woman and her infant son would have been reassuring to some indigenous nations and she played an important role in diplomatic relations by talking to chiefs easing tensions and giving the impression of a peaceful mission.nin his writings meriwether lewis presented a somewhat negative view of her though clark had a higher regard for her and provided some support for her children in subsequent years in the journals they used the terms squar and savages to refer to sacagawea and other indigenous peoples.nnaccomplishmentsnthe corps met their objective of reaching the pacific mapping and establishing their presence for a legal claim to the land they established diplomatic relations and trade with at least two dozen indigenous nations they did not find a continuous waterway to the pacific ocean but located an indian trail that led from the upper end of the missouri river to the columbia river which ran to the pacific ocean they gained information about the natural habitat flora and fauna bringing back various plant seed and mineral specimens they mapped the topography of the land designating the location of mountain ranges rivers and the many indian tribes during the course of their journey they also learned and recorded much about the language and customs of the american indian tribes they encountered and brought back many of their artifacts including bows clothing and ceremonial robes.nnaftermathn painting of mandan chief big white who accompanied lewis and clark on their return from the expeditionntwo months passed after the expeditions end before jefferson made his first public statement to congress and others giving a one-sentence summary about the success of the expedition before getting into the justification for the expenses involved in the course of their journey they acquired a knowledge of numerous tribes of indians hitherto unknown they informed themselves of the trade which may be carried on with them the best channels and positions for it and they are enabled to give with accuracy the geography of the line they pursued back east the botanical and zoological discoveries drew the intense interest of the american philosophical society who requested specimens various artifacts traded with the indians and reports on plants and wildlife along with various seeds obtained jefferson used seeds from missouri hominy corn along with a number of other unidentified seeds to plant at monticello which he cultivated and studied he later reported on the indian corn he had grown as being an excellent food source the expedition helped establish the u.s presence in the newly acquired territory and beyond and opened the door to further exploration trade and scientific discoveries.nlewis and clark returned from their expedition bringing with them the mandan indian chief shehaka from the upper missouri to visit the great father at washington city after chief shehakas visit it required multiple attempts and multiple military expeditions to safely return shehaka to his nation.nnlegacy and honorsnsince the expedition lewis and clark have been commemorated and honored
