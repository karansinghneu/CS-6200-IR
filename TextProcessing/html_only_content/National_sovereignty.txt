westphalian sovereignty wikipedia n redirected from national sovereigntyn jump to navigationnjump to searchnwestphalian sovereignty or state sovereignty is the principle in international law that each state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory the principle underlies the modern international system of sovereign states and is enshrined in the united nations charter which states that nothing should authorise intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state according to the idea every state no matter how large or small has an equal right to sovereignty political scientists have traced the concept to the peace of westphalia 1648 which ended the thirty years war the principle of non-interference was further developed in the 18th century the westphalian system reached its peak in the 19th and 20th centuries but it has faced recent challenges from advocates of humanitarian intervention.nncontentsnnnprincipleseditnthe peace of westphalia is considered by political scientists to be the beginning of the modern international system in which external powers should avoid interfering in another countrys domestic affairs however recent scholarship has argued that the westphalian treaties actually had little to do with the principles with which they are often associated sovereignty non-intervention and the legal equality of states for example osiander writes that the treaties confirm neither frances or swedens sovereignty nor anybody elses least of all do they contain anything about sovereignty as a principle nonetheless westphalian sovereignty continues to be used as a shorthand for the basic legal principles underlying the modern state system the applicability and relevance of these principles have been questioned from the mid-20th century onward from a variety of viewpoints much of the debate has turned on the ideas of internationalism and globalization which conflict with westphalian sovereignty.nnhistoryeditn the ratification of the treaty of mnster part of the peace of westphalia that ended the thirty years war.nthe origins of westphalian sovereignty have been traced in the scholarly literature to the peace of westphalia 1648 the peace treaties put an end to the thirty years war a war of religion that devastated germany and killed 30 of its population since neither the catholics nor the protestants had won a clear victory the peace settlement established a status quo order in which states would refrain from interfering in each others religious practices henry kissinger wrote:nnthe westphalian peace reflected a practical accommodation to reality not a unique moral insight it relied on a system of independent states refraining from interference in each others domestic affairs and checking each others ambitions through a general equilibrium of power no single claim to truth or universal rule had prevailed in europes contests instead each state was assigned the attribute of sovereign power over its territory each would acknowledge the domestic structures and religious vocations of its fellow states and refrain from challenging their existence.nnthe principle of non-interference in other countries domestic affairs was laid out in the mid-18th century by swiss jurist emer de vattel states became the primary institutional agents in an interstate system of relations the peace of westphalia is said to have ended attempts to impose supranational authority on european states the westphalian doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of nationalism under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to nationsgroups of people united by language and culture.nthe westphalian system reached its peak in the late 19th century although practical considerations still led powerful states to seek to influence the affairs of others forcible intervention by one country in the domestic affairs of another was less frequent between 1850 and 1900 than in most previous and subsequent periods.nafter the end of the cold war the united states and western europe began talking of a post-westphalian order in which countries could intervene against human rights abuses in other countries critics have pointed out such intervention would be and has been used to continue processes similar to standard euro-american colonialism and that the colonial powers always used ideas similar to humanitarian intervention to justify colonialism slavery and similar practices china and russia have thus used their united nations security council veto power to block what they see as american actions to violate the sovereignty of other nations.nnchallenges to westphaliaeditnthe end of the cold war saw increased international integration and arguably the erosion of westphalian sovereignty much of the literature was primarily concerned with criticizing realist models of international politics in which the notion of the state as a unitary agent is taken as axiomatic.nin 1998 at a symposium on the continuing political relevance of the peace of westphalia nato secretary-general javier solana said that humanity and democracy were two principles essentially irrelevant to the original westphalian order and levied a criticism that the westphalian system had its limits for one the principle of sovereignty it relied on also produced the basis for rivalry not community of states exclusion not integration."nin 1999 british prime minister tony blair gave a speech in chicago where he set out a new post-westphalian doctrine of the international community blair argued that globalization had made the westphalian approach anachronistic blair was later referred to by the daily telegraph as the man who ushered in the post-westphalian era others have also asserted that globalization has superseded the westphalian system.nin 2000 germanys foreign minister joschka fischer referred to the peace of westphalia in his humboldt speech which argued that the system of european politics set up by westphalia was obsolete the core of the concept of europe after 1945 was and still is a rejection of the european balance-of-power principle and the hegemonic ambitions of individual states that had emerged following the peace of westphalia in 1648 a rejection which took the form of closer meshing of vital interests and the transfer of nation-state sovereign rights to supranational european institutions."nthe european unions concept of shared sovereignty is also somewhat contrary to historical views of westphalian sovereignty as it provides for external agents to influence and interfere in the internal affairs of its member countries in a 2008 article phil williams links the rise of terrorism and violent non-state actors vnsas which pose a threat to the westphalian sovereignty of the state to globalization.nnmilitary interventioneditninterventions such as in cambodia by vietnam the cambodianvietnamese war or in bangladesh then a part of pakistan by india the bangladesh liberation war and the indo-pakistani war of 1971 were seen by some as examples of humanitarian intervention although their basis in international law is debatable other more recent interventions and their attendant infringements of state sovereignty also have prompted debates about their legality and motivations.na new notion of contingent sovereignty seems to be emerging but it has not yet reached the point of international legitimacy neoconservatism in particular has developed this line of thinking further asserting that a lack of democracy may foreshadow future humanitarian crises or that democracy itself constitutes a human right and therefore states not respecting democratic principles open themselves up to just war by other countries however proponents of this theory have been accused of being concerned about democracy human rights and humanitarian crises only in countries where american global dominance is challenged while hypocritically ignoring the same issues in other countries friendlier to the united states.nfurther criticism of westphalian sovereignty arises regarding allegedly failed states of which afghanistan before the 2001 us-led invasion is often considered an example in this case it is argued that no sovereignty exists and that international intervention is justified on humanitarian grounds and by the threats posed by failed states to neighboring countries and the world as a whole.nndefenders of westphaliaeditnalthough the westphalian system developed in early modern europe its staunchest defenders can now be found in the non-western world the presidents of china and russia issued a joint statement in 2001 vowing to counter attempts to undermine the fundamental norms of the international law with the help of concepts such as humanitarian intervention and limited sovereignty china and russia have used their united nations security council veto power to block what they see as american violations of state sovereignty in syria russia was left out of the original westphalian system in 1648 but post-soviet russia has seen westphalian sovereignty as a means to balance american power by encouraging a multipolar world order.nsome in the west also speak favorably of the westphalian state american political scientist stephen walt urged u.s president donald trump to return to westphalian principles calling it a sensible course for american foreign policy american political commentator pat buchanan has also spoken in favor of the traditional nation-state.nnsee alsoeditnnfurther readingeditnnreferenceseditnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
