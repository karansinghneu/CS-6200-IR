salle university is named see jean-baptiste de la salle.nnnnnnren-robert cavelier sieur de la salle november 22 1643 march 19 1687 was a 17th century french explorer and fur trader in north america he explored the great lakes region of the united states and canada the mississippi river and the gulf of mexico he is best known for an early 1682 expedition in which he canoed the lower mississippi river from the mouth of the illinois river to the gulf of mexico and claimed the entire mississippi river basin for france.nla salle is often credited with being the first european to traverse the ohio river and sometimes the mississippi as well it has now been established that joliet and marquette preceded him on the mississippi in their journey of 1673-74 and the existing historical evidence does not indicate that la salle ever reached the ohio/allegheny valley.nncontentsnnnsieur de la sallensieur de la salle is a french title roughly translating to lord of the manor from the old french sale modern salle hall a manor house sieur is a french title of nobility similar to the english sir but under the french signeurial system the title is purchased rather than earned and does not imply military duty it refers to robert caveliers signeurial purchase of lachine nfrom the sulpician order at ville marie around 1667 the phrase la salle has become iconic and associated with the person as if it were his name in expressions such as robert la salle or simply la salle".nnearly lifen coat of arms of ren-robert cavelier sieur de la sallenrobert cavelier was born on november 22 1643 into a comfortably well-off family in rouen france in the parish saint-herbland when he was younger he enjoyed science and nature as a man he studied with the jesuit religious order and became a member after taking initial vows in 1660 at his request on march 27 1667 after he was in canada he was released from the society of jesus after citing moral weaknesses although he left the order never took final vows in it and later became hostile to it historians sometimes described him incorrectly as a priest or a leader.nnfamilynla salle never married but has been linked to madeleine de roybon dallonne an early settler of new france his older brother jean cavelier was a sulpician priest his parents were jean cavelier and catherine geest.nnlachinenrequired to reject his fathers legacy when he joined the jesuits la salle was nearly destitute when he traveled as a prospective colonist to north america he sailed for new france in the spring of 1666 his brother jean a sulpician priest had moved there the year before he was granted a seigneurie on land at the western end of the island of montreal which became known as lachine la salle immediately began to issue land grants set up a village and learn the languages of the native people several tribes of iroquois in this area.nnexpeditionsn"ohio expeditionnpreparationnthe seneca told him of a great river called the ohio which flowed into the sea the vermilion sea he began to plan for expeditions to find a western passage to china he sought and received permission from governor daniel courcelle and intendant jean talon to embark on the enterprise he sold his interests in lachine to finance the venture.nnjourneynla salle left lachine by the st lawrence on july 6 1669 with a flotilla of nine canoes and 24 men plus their seneca indian guides himself and 14 hired men in 4 canoes the two sulpicians dollier de casson and abb ren de brhan de galine with 7 new recruits in three canoes and two canoes of indians there they went up the st lawrence and across lake ontario after 35 days they arrived at what we call today irondequoit bay on the southern shore of lake ontario at the mouth of irondequoit creek a place now commemorated as la salles landing nnindian villagesnthere they were greeted by a party of indians who escorted them starting the next day to a village some leagues distant a journey of a few days at the village the seneca vehemently attempted to dissuade the party from proceeding into the lands of their enemies the algonquins telling of the dire fate awaiting them the necessity of securing guides for the further part of the journey and the obstinacy of the seneca to provide them delayed the expedition a month a fortuitous capture by the indians in the lands to the south of a dutchman who spoke iroquois well but french ill and was to be burned at the stake for transgressions unknown provided an opportunity to obtain a guide the dutchmans freedom was purchased by the party in exchange for wampum nwhile at the indian village in sept 1669 la salle was seized with a violent fever and expressed the intention of returning to ville marie.nnniagara and lake erienat this juncture he parted from his company and the narrative of the jesuits who continued on to upper lake erie.the missionaries continued on to the upper lakes to the land of the potawatomies.nother accounts have it that some of la salles men soon returned to new holland or ville marie.nnfurther evidencenbeyond that the factual record of la salles first expedition ends and what prevails is obscurity and fabrication it is likely that he spent the winter in ville marie the next confirmed sighting of la salle was by nicolas perrot on the ottawa river near the rapide des chats in early summer 1670 hunting with a party of iroquois that would be 700 miles as the crow flies from the falls of the ohio the point supposed by some that he reached on the ohio river.nla salles own journal of the expedition was lost in 1756 two indirect historical accounts exist the one rcit dun ami de labb de gallin purported to be a recitation by la salle himself to an unknown writer during his visit to paris in 1678 and the other mmoire sur le projet du sieur de la salle pour la descouverte de la partie occidentale de lamrique septentrionale entre la nouvelle-france la floride et le mexique a letter from madeleine cavelier his now elderly niece written in 1746 commenting on the journal of la salle in her possession may also shed some light on the issue nla salle himself never claimed to have discovered the ohio river in a letter to the intendent talon in 1677 he claimed discovery of a river the baudrane flowing southwesterly with its mouth on lake erie and emptying into the saint louis i.e the mississippi a hydrography which was non-existent in those days maps as well as descriptions were based part on observation and part on hearsay of necessity this confounded courses mouths and confluences among the rivers at various times la salle invented such rivers as the chucagoa baudrane louisiane anglicized saint louis and ouabanchi-aramoni these included segments of those hed actually traversed which were earlier the illinois and kankakee st josephs of lake michigan probably the ouabache wabash and possibly the upper allegheny and later the chicago and lower mississippi he also correctly described the missouri though it was hearsay hed never been on it.nconfounding fact with fiction started with publication in 1876 of margrys dcouvertes et etablissements des franais margry was a french archivist and partisan who had private access to the french archives he came to be the agent of the american historian francis parkman margrys work a massive 9 volumes encompassed an assemblage of documents some previously published but many not in it he sometimes published a reproduction of the whole document and sometimes only an extract or summary not distinguishing the one from the other he also used in some cases one or another copies of original documents previously edited extracted or altered by others without specifying which transcriptions were original and which were copies or whether the copy was dated earlier or later reproductions were scattered in fragments across chapters so that it was impossible to ascertain the integrity of the document from its fragments chapter headings were oblique and sensational so as to obfuscate the content therein english and american scholars were immediately skeptical of the work since full and faithful publication of some of the original documents had previously existed the situation was so fraught with doubt that the united states congress appropriated 10,000 in 1873 which margry wanted as an advance to have the original documents photostated witnessed by uninvolved parties as to veracity.nndiscovery of the ohio and mississippinmain articles ohio river history and mississippi river historynfurther information batts and fallam expedition and needham and arthur expeditionnif la salle is excused from discovering the two great rivers of the midwest history does not leave a void on may 8 1541 south of present-day memphis tennessee spanish conquistador hernando de soto reached the mississippi river which the spanish called the rio grande for its immense size he was the first european to document and cross the river though not traverse it it is uncontested that louis joliet and jacques marquette were the first europeans to traverse the upper mississippi in 1673 and that father louis hennepin and antonine augalle visited the falls of st anthony on the upper mississippi in spring 1680 in advance of la salles own excursion in early 1682.ncredit for discovery of the ohio river is provisionally given to two obscure early english explorers thomas batts and robert fallam from virginia who visited woods river today called the new river a tributary of the ohio via the kanawha in what is today west virginia in sept 1671 other scholars declaim that this short one month expedition did not penetrate to the ohio to the west but elect instead virginia englishmen james needham and gabriel arthur who in 1673-74 circumnavigated the southeast finally traversing shawnee villages along the ohio the lower ohio river first began appearing on french maps about 1674 in approximately its correct hydrography and in its relation to the mississippi though diagrammed more northerly approaching lake erie from the west and may have been confounded with the maumee portage route a memoir by m de denonville in 1688 recites that the lower ohio at least from its confluence with the wabash to the mississippi was a familiar trade route in 1692 arnout viele a dutchman from new york traversed the length of the ohio from the headwaters of the allegheny in pennsylvania to its mouth on the mississippi though the hydrography of the allegheny remained opaque for at least several decades thereafter.nngreat lakes fortsn depiction of la

rough wooden palisade on a point of land by a shallow sheltered bay originally the fort was named fort cataraqui but was later renamed fort frontenac by la salle in honor of his patron the purpose of

lieutenant.nin early 1679 la salles expedition built fort conti at the mouth of the niagara river on lake ontario there they loaded supplies from fort frontenac into smaller boats canoes or bateaux so they could continue up the shallow and swiftly flowing lower niagara river to what is now the location of lewiston new york there the iroquois had a well-established portage route which bypassed the rapids and the cataract later known as niagara falls.nthe first ship built by la salle called the frontenac a 10-ton single-decked brigantine or barque was lost in lake ontario on january 8 1679

lake huron then up huron to michilimackinac and on to present-day green bay wisconsin le griffon left for niagara with a load of furs but was never seen again he continued with his men in canoes down the western shore of lake michigan rounding the southern end to the mouth of the miami river now st joseph river where they built a stockade in january 1680 they called it fort miami now known as st joseph michigan there they waited for tonti and his party who had crossed the lower michigan peninsula on foot.ntonti arrived on november 20 on december 3 the entire party set off up the st joseph which they followed until they had to take a portage at present-day south bend indiana they crossed to the kankakee river and followed it to the illinois river there they built fort crvecoeur which later led to the development of present-day peoria illinois la salle set off on foot for fort frontenac for supplies while he was gone the soldiers at ft crevecoeur led by martin chartier mutinied destroyed the fort and exiled tonti whom he had left in charge he later captured most of the mutineers on lake ontario before rendezvousing with tonti at st ignace michigan.nnmississippi expeditionn
