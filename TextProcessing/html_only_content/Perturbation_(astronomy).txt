perturbation astronomy wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnn the perturbing forces of the sun on the moon at two places in its orbit the blue arrows represent the direction and magnitude of the gravitational force on the earth applying this to both the earths and the moons position does not disturb the positions relative to each other when it is subtracted from the force on the moon black arrows what is left is the perturbing force red arrows on the moon relative to the earth because the perturbing force is different in direction and magnitude on opposite sides of the orbit it produces a change in the shape of the orbit.nin astronomy perturbation is the complex motion of a massive body subject to forces other than the gravitational attraction of a single other massive body the other forces can include a third fourth fifth etc body resistance as from an atmosphere and the off-center attraction of an oblate or otherwise misshapen body.nncontentsnnnintroductioneditnthe study of perturbations began with the first attempts to predict planetary motions in the sky in ancient times the causes were a mystery newton at the time he formulated his laws of motion and of gravitation applied them to the first analysis of perturbations recognizing the complex difficulties of their calculation many of the great mathematicians since then have given attention to the various problems involved throughout the 18th and 19th centuries there was demand for accurate tables of the position of the moon and planets for marine navigation.nthe complex motions of gravitational perturbations can be broken down the hypothetical motion that the body follows under the gravitational effect of one other body only is typically a conic section and can be readily described with the methods of geometry this is called a two-body problem or an unperturbed keplerian orbit the differences between that and the actual motion of the body are perturbations due to the additional gravitational effects of the remaining body or bodies if there is only one other significant body then the perturbed motion is a three-body problem if there are multiple other bodies it is an n-body problem a general analytical solution a mathematical expression to predict the positions and motions at any future time exists for the two-body problem when more than two bodies are considered analytic solutions exist only for special cases even the two-body problem becomes insoluble if one of the bodies is irregular in shape.nn mercurys orbital longitude and latitude as perturbed by venus jupiter and all of the planets of the solar system at intervals of 2.5 days mercury would remain centered on the crosshairs if there were no perturbations.nmost systems that involve multiple gravitational attractions present one primary body which is dominant in its effects for example a star in the case of the star and its planet or a planet in the case of the planet and its satellite the gravitational effects of the other bodies can be treated as perturbations of the hypothetical unperturbed motion of the planet or satellite around its primary body.nnmathematical analysiseditngeneral perturbationseditnin methods of general perturbations general differential equations either of motion or of change in the orbital elements are solved analytically usually by series expansions the result is usually expressed in terms of algebraic and trigonometric functions of the orbital elements of the body in question and the perturbing bodies this can be applied generally to many different sets of conditions and is not specific to any particular set of gravitating objects historically general perturbations were investigated first the classical methods are known as variation of the elements variation of parameters or variation of the constants of integration in these methods it is considered that the body is always moving in a conic section however the conic section is constantly changing due to the perturbations if all perturbations were to cease at any particular instant the body would continue in this now unchanging conic section indefinitely this conic is known as the osculating orbit and its orbital elements at any particular time are what are sought by the methods of general perturbations.ngeneral perturbations takes advantage of the fact that in many problems of celestial mechanics the two-body orbit changes rather slowly due to the perturbations the two-body orbit is a good first approximation general perturbations is applicable only if the perturbing forces are about one order of magnitude smaller or less than the gravitational force of the primary body in the solar system this is usually the case jupiter the second largest body has a mass of about 1/1000 that of the sun.ngeneral perturbation methods are preferred for some types of problems as the source of certain observed motions are readily found this is not necessarily so for special perturbations the motions would be predicted with similar accuracy but no information on the configurations of the perturbing bodies for instance an orbital resonance which caused them would be available.nnspecial perturbationseditnin methods of special perturbations numerical datasets representing values for the positions velocities and accelerative forces on the bodies of interest are made the basis of numerical integration of the differential equations of motion in effect the positions and velocities are perturbed directly and no attempt is made to calculate the curves of the orbits or the orbital elements.nspecial perturbations can be applied to any problem in celestial mechanics as it is not limited to cases where the perturbing forces are small once applied only to comets and minor planets special perturbation methods are now the basis of the most accurate machine-generated planetary ephemerides of the great astronomical almanacs special perturbations are also used for modeling an orbit with computers.nncowells formulationeditn cowells method forces from all perturbing bodies black and gray are summed to form the total force on body i red and this is numerically integrated starting from the initial position the epoch of osculation.ncowells formulation so named for philip h cowell who with a.c.d cromellin used a similar method to predict the return of halleys comet is perhaps the simplest of the special perturbation methods in a system of mutually interacting bodies this method mathematically solves for the newtonian forces on body by summing the individual interactions from the other bodies:nnnwhere is the acceleration vector of body is the gravitational constant is the mass of body and are the position vectors of objects and respectively and is the distance from object to object all vectors being referred to the barycenter of the system this equation is resolved into components in and and these are integrated numerically to form the new velocity and position vectors this process is repeated as many times as necessary the advantage of cowells method is ease of application and programming a disadvantage is that when perturbations become large in magnitude as when an object makes a close approach to another the errors of the method also become large nhowever for many problems in celestial mechanics this is never the case another disadvantage is that in systems with a dominant central body such as the sun it is necessary to carry many significant digits in the arithmetic because of the large difference in the forces of the central body and the perturbing bodies although with modern computers this is not nearly the limitation it once was.nnenckes methodeditn enckes method greatly exaggerated here the small difference r blue between the osculating unperturbed orbit black and the perturbed orbit red is numerically integrated starting from the initial position the epoch of osculation.nenckes method begins with the osculating orbit as a reference and integrates numerically to solve for the variation from the reference as a function of time nits advantages are that perturbations are generally small in magnitude so the integration can proceed in larger steps with resulting lesser errors and the method is much less affected by extreme perturbations its disadvantage is complexity it cannot be used indefinitely without occasionally updating the osculating orbit and continuing from there a process known as rectification enckes method is similar to the general perturbation method of variation of the elements except the rectification is performed at discrete intervals rather than continuously.nletting be the radius vector of the osculating orbit the radius vector of the perturbed orbit and the variation from the osculating orbit,nnnn and are just the equations of motion of and nnnnwhere is the gravitational parameter with and the masses of the central body and the perturbed body is the perturbing acceleration and and are the magnitudes of and nsubstituting from equations 3 and 4 into equation 2,nnnwhich in theory could be integrated twice to find since the osculating orbit is easily calculated by two-body methods and are accounted for and can be solved in practice the quantity in the brackets is the difference of two nearly equal vectors and further manipulation is necessary to avoid the need for extra significant digits nenckes method was more widely used before the advent of modern computers when much orbit computation was performed on mechanical calculating machines.nnperiodic natureeditn gravity simulator plot of the changing orbital eccentricity of mercury venus earth and mars over the next 50,000 years the 0 point on this plot is the year 2007.nin the solar system many of the disturbances of one planet by another are periodic consisting of small impulses each time a planet passes another in its orbit this causes the bodies to follow motions that are periodic or quasi-periodic such as the moon in its strongly perturbed orbit which is the subject of lunar theory this periodic nature led to the discovery of neptune in 1846 as a result of its perturbations of the orbit of uranus.non-going mutual perturbations of the planets cause long-term quasi-periodic variations in their orbital elements most apparent when two planets orbital periods are nearly in sync for instance five orbits of jupiter 59.31 years is nearly equal to two of saturn 58.91 years this causes large perturbations of both with a period of 918 years the time required for the small difference in their positions at conjunction to make one complete circle first discovered by laplace venus currently has the orbit with the least eccentricity i.e it is the closest to circular of all the planetary orbits in 25,000 years time earth will have a more circular less eccentric orbit than venus it has been shown that long-term periodic disturbances within the solar system can become chaotic over very long time scales under some circumstances one or more planets can cross the orbit of another leading to collisions.nthe orbits of many of the minor bodies of the solar system such as comets are often heavily perturbed particularly by the gravitational fields of the gas giants while many of these perturbations are periodic others are not and these in particular may represent aspects of chaotic motion for example in april 1996 jupiters gravitational influence caused the period of comet halebopps orbit to decrease from 4,206 to 2,380 years a change that will not revert on any periodic basis.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
