venera 13 wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnvenera 13 russian 13 meaning venus 13 was a probe in the soviet venera program for the exploration of venus.nvenera 13 and 14 were identical spacecraft built to take advantage of the 1981 venus launch opportunity and launched 5 days apart venera 13 on 30 october 1981 at 06:04 utc and venera 14 on 4 november 1981 at 05:31 utc both with an on-orbit dry mass of 760 kg 1,680 lb.nncontentsnnndesigneditneach mission consisted of a cruise stage and an attached descent craft.nncruise stageeditnas the cruise stage flew by venus the bus acted as a data relay for the lander and then continued on into a heliocentric orbit it was equipped with a gamma-ray spectrometer uv grating monochromator electron and proton spectrometers gamma-ray burst detectors solar wind plasma detectors and two-frequency transmitters which made measurements before during and after the venus flyby.nndescent landereditnthe descent lander was a hermetically-sealed pressure vessel which contained most of the instrumentation and electronics mounted on a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna the design was similar to the earlier venera 912 landers it carried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements monitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight and record electric discharges during its descent phase through the venusian atmosphere the spacecraft utilized a camera system an x-ray fluorescence spectrometer a screw drill and surface sampler a dynamic penetrometer and a seismometer to conduct investigations on the surface.nlist of lander experiments and instruments:nnnlandingeditnafter launch and a four-month cruise to venus the descent vehicle separated from the cruise stage and plunged into the venusian atmosphere on 1 march 1982 after entering the atmosphere a parachute was deployed at an altitude of about 50 kilometres 31 mi the parachute was released and simple airbraking was used the rest of the way to the surface.nvenera 13 landed at around 7-8m/s at 730s 30300e 7.5s 303e 7.5 303 about 950 km 590 mi northeast of venera 14 just east of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as phoebe regio.nthe lander had cameras to take pictures of the ground and spring-loaded arms to measure the compressibility of the soil the quartz camera windows were covered by lens caps which popped off after descent.nthe area was composed of bedrock outcrops surrounded by dark fine-grained soil after landing an imaging panorama was started and a mechanical drilling arm reached to the surface and obtained a sample which was deposited in a hermetically sealed chamber maintained at 30 c 86 f and a pressure of about 0.05 atmosphere 5 kpa the composition of the sample determined by the x-ray fluorescence spectrometer put it in the class of weakly differentiated melanocratic alkaline gabbroids.nthe lander functioned for at least 127 minutes the planned design life was 32 minutes in an environment with a temperature of 457 c 855 f and a pressure of 89 earth atmospheres 9.0 mpa the descent vehicle transmitted data to the satellite which acted as a data relay as it flew by venus.nmicrophones on the probe recorded atmospheric wind noises in an effort to measure wind speed they also recorded noises associated with the probes equipment this was the first recording of sound on another planet the recording would be repeated with venera 14.nnsuggested photographic evidence of lifeeditnleonid ksanfomaliti of space research institute of the russian academy of sciences a contributor to the venera mission and stan karaszewski of karas suggested signs of life in the venera images in an article published in solar system research according to ksanfomaliti certain objects resembled a disk a black flap and a scorpion which emerge fluctuate and disappear referring to their changing location on different photographs and traces on the ground.nengineers familiar with the probe have identified the moving disk as actually being the two lens caps ejected from the lander rather than a single object that had moved between two different places they are simply two inanimate similar-looking objects in different places the other objects are ascribed to image processing artifacts and do not appear in the original photography.nthe editors of solar system research published an editorial comment and a number of commentary articles from other scientists in their september 2012 publication of issue 5 volume 46 of the journal that issue also includes a second article from ksanfomaliti in which he claims to identify several other life forms and speculates regarding the apparent rich diversity of life around the landing site.nthese claims have been refuted by the live science website.nnin fictioneditnnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
