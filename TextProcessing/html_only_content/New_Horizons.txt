new horizons wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnasa space probe launched to study the dwarf planet plutonthis article is about the space probe for other uses see new horizons disambiguation.nnnew horizons is an interplanetary space probe that was launched as a part of nasas new frontiers program engineered by the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory apl and the southwest research institute swri with a team led by s alan stern the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the pluto system in 2015 and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other kuiper belt objects kbos in the decade to follow which as of 2019 includes 2014 mu69 it is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the solar system.non january 19 2006 new horizons was launched from cape canaveral air force station by an atlas v rocket directly into an earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s 10.10 mi/s 58,500 km/h 36,400 mph it was the fastest man-made object ever launched from earth after a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 apl new horizons proceeded to jupiter making its closest approach on february 28 2007 at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers 1.4 million miles the jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased new horizons speed the flyby also enabled a general test of new horizons scientific capabilities returning data about the planets atmosphere moons and magnetosphere.nmost of the post-jupiter voyage was spent in hibernation mode to preserve on-board systems except for brief annual checkouts on december 6 2014 new horizons was brought back online for the pluto encounter and instrument check-out began on january 15 2015 the spacecraft began its approach phase to pluto.non july 14 2015 at 11:49 utc it flew 12,500 km 7,800 mi above the surface of pluto making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet on october 25 2016 at 21:48 utc the last of the recorded data from the pluto flyby was received from new horizons having completed its flyby of pluto new horizons then maneuvered for a flyby of kuiper belt object 486958 2014 mu69 ultima thule which occurred on january 1 2019 when it was 43.4 au from the sun in august 2018 nasa cited results by alice on new horizons to confirm the existence of a hydrogen wall at the outer edges of the solar system this wall was first detected in 1992 by the two voyager spacecraft.nnncontentsnnnhistoryeditnmain article exploration of pluton usps stamp issued in 1991 that served as motivation for planetary scientists to send a probe to pluton early concept art of the new horizons spacecraft the mission led by the applied physics laboratory and alan stern eventually became the first mission to pluto.nin august 1992 jpl scientist robert staehle called pluto discoverer clyde tombaugh requesting permission to visit his planet i told him he was welcome to it tombaugh later remembered though hes got to go one long cold trip the call eventually led to a series of proposed pluto missions leading up to new horizons.nstamatios tom krimigis head of the applied physics laboratorys space division one of many entrants in the new frontiers program competition formed the new horizons team with alan stern in december 2000 appointed as the projects principal investigator stern was described by krimigis as the personification of the pluto mission new horizons was based largely on sterns work since pluto 350 and involved most of the team from pluto kuiper express the new horizons proposal was one of five that were officially submitted to nasa it was later selected as one of two finalists to be subject to a three-month concept study in june 2001 the other finalist posse pluto and outer solar system explorer was a separate but similar pluto mission concept by the university of colorado boulder led by principal investigator larry w esposito and supported by the jpl lockheed martin and the university of california however the apl in addition to being supported by pluto kuiper express developers at the goddard space flight center and stanford university were at an advantage they had recently developed near shoemaker for nasa which had successfully entered orbit around 433 eros earlier in the year and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare.nin november 2001 new horizons was officially selected for funding as part of the new frontiers program however the new nasa administrator appointed by the bush administration sean okeefe was not supportive of new horizons and effectively cancelled it by not including it in nasas budget for 2003 nasas associate administrator for the science mission directorate ed weiler prompted stern to lobby for the funding of new horizons in hopes of the mission appearing in the planetary science decadal survey a prioritized wish list compiled by the united states national research council that reflects the opinions of the scientific community after an intense campaign to gain support for new horizons the planetary science decadal survey of 20032013 was published in the summer of 2002 new horizons topped the list of projects considered the highest priority among the scientific community in the medium-size category ahead of missions to the moon and even jupiter weiler stated that it was a result that his administration was not going to fight funding for the mission was finally secured following the publication of the report and sterns team were finally able to start building the spacecraft and its instruments with a planned launch in january 2006 and arrival at pluto in 2015 alice bowman became mission operations manager.nnmission profileeditn artists impression of new horizons close encounter with the plutonian systemnnew horizons is the first mission in nasas new frontiers mission category larger and more expensive than the discovery missions but smaller than the flagship program the cost of the mission including spacecraft and instrument development launch vehicle mission operations data analysis and education/public outreach is approximately 700 million over 15 years 20012016 the spacecraft was built primarily by southwest research institute swri and the johns hopkins applied physics laboratory the missions principal investigator is alan stern of the southwest research institute formerly nasa associate administrator.nafter separation from the launch vehicle overall control was taken by mission operations center moc at the applied physics laboratory in howard county maryland the science instruments are operated at clyde tombaugh science operations center t-soc in boulder colorado navigation is performed at various contractor facilities whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the naval observatory flagstaff station through headquarters nasa and jpl kinetx is the lead on the new horizons navigation team and is responsible for planning trajectory adjustments as the spacecraft speeds toward the outer solar system coincidentally the naval observatory flagstaff station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of plutos moon charon and the naval observatory is itself not far from the lowell observatory where pluto was discovered.nnew horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the solar system when the spacecraft was launched pluto was still classified as a planet later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the international astronomical union iau some members of the new horizons team including alan stern disagree with the iau definition and still describe pluto as the ninth planet plutos satellites nix and hydra also have a connection with the spacecraft the first letters of their names n and h are the initials of new horizons the moons discoverers chose these names for this reason plus nix and hydras relationship to the mythological pluto.nin addition to the science equipment there are several cultural artifacts traveling with the spacecraft these include a collection of 434,738 names stored on a compact disc a piece of scaled compositess spaceshipone a not yet explored usps stamp and a flag of the united states along with other mementos.nabout 30 grams 1 oz of clyde tombaughs ashes are aboard the spacecraft to commemorate his discovery of pluto in 1930 a florida-state quarter coin whose design commemorates human exploration is included officially as a trim weight one of the science packages a dust counter is named after venetia burney who as a child suggested the name pluto after its discovery.nngoaleditn view of mission operations at the applied physics laboratory in laurel maryland july 14 2015nthe goal of the mission is to understand the formation of the plutonian system the kuiper belt and the transformation of the early solar system the spacecraft collected data on the atmospheres surfaces interiors and environments of pluto and its moons it will also study other objects in the kuiper belt by way of comparison new horizons gathered 5,000 times as much data at pluto as mariner did at the red planet."nsome of the questions the mission attempts to answer are what is plutos atmosphere made of and how does it behave what does its surface look like are there large geological structures how do solar wind particles interact with plutos atmosphere?nspecifically the missions science objectives are to:nnndesign and constructioneditn interactive 3d model of new horizonsnspacecraft subsystemseditn new horizons at kennedy space center in 2005nthe spacecraft is comparable in size and general shape to a grand piano and has been compared to a piano glued to a cocktail bar-sized satellite dish as a point of departure the team took inspiration from the ulysses spacecraft which also carried a radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg and dish on a box-in-box structure through the outer solar system many subsystems and components have flight heritage from apls contour spacecraft which in turn had heritage from apls timed spacecraft.nnew horizons body forms a triangle almost 0.76 m 2.5 ft thick the pioneers have hexagonal bodies whereas the voyagers galileo and cassinihuygens have decagonal hollow bodies a 7075 aluminium alloy tube forms the main structural column between the launch vehicle adapter ring at the rear and the 2.1 m 6 ft 11 in radio dish antenna affixed to the front flat side the titanium fuel tank is in this tube the rtg attaches with a 4-sided titanium mount resembling a gray pyramid or stepstool titanium provides strength and thermal isolation the rest of the triangle is primarily sandwich panels of thin aluminium facesheet less than in or 0.40 mm bonded to aluminium honeycomb core the structure is larger than strictly necessary with empty space inside the structure is designed to act as shielding reducing electronics errors caused by radiation from the rtg also the mass distribution required for a spinning spacecraft demands a wider triangle.nthe interior structure is painted black to equalize temperature by radiative heat transfer overall the spacecraft is thoroughly blanketed to retain heat unlike the pioneers and voyagers the radio dish is also enclosed in blankets that extend to the body the heat from the rtg adds warmth to the spacecraft while it is in the outer solar system while in the inner solar system the spacecraft must prevent overheating hence electronic activity is limited power is diverted to shunts with attached radiators and louvers are opened to radiate excess heat while the spacecraft is cruising inactively in the cold outer solar system the louvers are closed and the shunt regulator reroutes power to electric heaters.nnpropulsion and attitude controleditnnew horizons has both spin-stabilized cruise and three-axis stabilized science modes controlled entirely with hydrazine monopropellant additional post launch delta-v of over 290 m/s 1,000 km/h 650 mph is provided by a 77 kg 170 lb internal tank helium is used as a pressurant with an elastomeric diaphragm assisting expulsion the spacecrafts on-orbit mass including fuel is over 470 kg 1,040 lb on the jupiter flyby trajectory but would have been only 445 kg 981 lb for the backup direct flight option to pluto significantly had the backup option been taken this would have meant less fuel for later kuiper belt operations.nthere are 16 thrusters on new horizons four 4.4 n 1.0 lbf and twelve 0.9 n 0.2 lbf plumbed into redundant branches the larger thrusters are used primarily for trajectory corrections and the small ones previously used on cassini and the voyager spacecraft are used primarily for attitude control and spinup/spindown maneuvers two star cameras are used to measure the spacecraft attitude they are mounted on the face of the spacecraft and provide attitude information while in spin-stabilized or 3-axis mode in between the time of star camera readings spacecraft orientation is provided by dual redundant miniature inertial measurement units each unit contains three solid-state gyroscopes and three accelerometers two adcole sun sensors provide attitude determination one detects the angle to the sun whereas the other measures spin rate and clocking.nnpowereditn new horizons rtgna cylindrical radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg protrudes in the plane of the triangle from one vertex of the triangle the rtg provided 7002245700000000000245.7 w of power at launch and was predicted to drop approximately 70003500000000000003.5 w every year decaying to 7002202000000000000202 w by the time of its encounter with the plutonian system in 2015 and will decay too far to power the transmitters in the 2030s there are no onboard batteries since rtg output is predictable and load transients are handled by a capacitor bank and fast circuit breakers as of january 2019 the power output of the rtg is about 7002190000000000000190 w.nthe rtg model gphs-rtg was originally a spare from the cassini mission the rtg contains 9.75 kg 21.5 lb of plutonium-238 oxide pellets each pellet is clad in iridium then encased in a graphite shell it was developed by the u.s department of energy at the materials and fuels complex a part of the idaho national laboratory.nthe original rtg design called for 10.9 kg 24 lb of plutonium but a unit less powerful than the original design goal was produced because of delays at the united states department of energy including security activities that delayed plutonium production the mission parameters and observation sequence had to be modified for the reduced wattage still not all instruments can operate simultaneously the department of energy transferred the space battery program from ohio to argonne in 2002 because of security concerns.nthe amount of radioactive plutonium in the rtg is about one-third the amount on board the cassinihuygens probe when it launched in 1997 that cassini launch was protested by some the united states department of energy estimated the chances of a launch accident that would release radiation into the atmosphere at 1 in 350 and monitored the launch as it always does when rtgs are involved it was estimated that a worst-case scenario of total dispersal of on-board plutonium would spread the equivalent radiation of 80 the average annual dosage in north america from background radiation over an area with a radius of 105 km 65 mi.nnflight computereditnthe spacecraft carries two computer systems the command and data handling system and the guidance and control processor each of the two systems is duplicated for redundancy for a total of four computers the processor used for its flight computers is the mongoose-v a 12 mhz radiation-hardened version of the mips r3000 cpu multiple redundant clocks and timing routines are implemented in hardware and software to help prevent faults and downtime to conserve heat and mass spacecraft and instrument electronics are housed together in iems integrated electronics modules there are two redundant iems including other functions such as instrument and radio electronics each iem contains 9 boards the software of the probe runs on nucleus rtos operating system.nthere have been two safing events that sent the spacecraft into safe mode:nnntelecommunications and data handlingeditn new horizons antennasncommunication with the spacecraft is via x band the craft had a communication rate of 700438000000000000038 kbit/s at jupiter at plutos distance a rate of approximately 70031000000000000001 kbit/s per transmitter was expected besides the low data rate plutos distance also causes a latency of about 4.5 hours one-way the 70 m 230 ft nasa deep space network dsn dishes are used to relay commands once it is beyond jupiter the spacecraft uses dual modular redundancy transmitters and receivers and either right or left-hand circular polarization the downlink signal is amplified by dual redundant 12-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers twtas mounted on the body under the dish the receivers are new low-power designs the system can be controlled to power both twtas at the same time and transmit a dual-polarized downlink signal to the dsn that nearly doubles the downlink rate dsn tests early in the mission with this dual polarization combining technique were successful and the capability is now considered operational when the spacecraft power budget permits both twtas to be powered.nin addition to the high-gain antenna there are two backup low-gain antennas and a medium-gain dish the high-gain dish has a cassegrain reflector layout composite construction of 2.1-meter 7 ft diameter providing over 700142000000000000042 dbi of gain and a half-power beam width of about a degree the prime-focus medium-gain antenna with a 0.3-meter 1 ft aperture and 10 half-power beam width is mounted to the back of the high-gain antennas secondary reflector the forward low-gain antenna is stacked atop the feed of the medium-gain antenna the aft low-gain antenna is mounted within the launch adapter at the rear of the spacecraft this antenna was used only for early mission phases near earth just after launch and for emergencies if the spacecraft had lost attitude control.nnew horizons recorded scientific instrument data to its solid-state memory buffer at each encounter then transmitted the data to earth data storage is done on two low-power solid-state recorders one primary one backup holding up to 70008000000000000008 gigabytes each because of the extreme distance from pluto and the kuiper belt only one buffer load at those encounters can be saved this is because new horizons would require approximately 16 months after leaving the vicinity of pluto to transmit the buffer load back to earth at plutos distance radio signals from the space probe back to earth took four hours and 25 minutes to traverse 4.7 billion km of space.npart of the reason for the delay between the gathering of and transmission of data is that all of the new horizons instrumentation is body-mounted in order for the cameras to record data the entire probe must turn and the one-degree-wide beam of the high-gain antenna was not pointing toward earth previous spacecraft such as the voyager program probes had a rotatable instrumentation platform a scan platform that could take measurements from virtually any angle without losing radio contact with earth new horizons was mechanically simplified to save weight shorten the schedule and improve reliability during its 15-year lifetime.nthe voyager 2 scan platform jammed at saturn and the demands of long time exposures at outer planets led to a change of plans such that the entire probe was rotated to make photos at uranus and neptune similar to how new horizons rotated.nnscience payloadeditnnew horizons carries seven instruments three optical instruments two plasma instruments a dust sensor and a radio science receiver/radiometer the instruments are to be used to investigate the global geology surface composition surface temperature atmospheric pressure atmospheric temperature and escape rate of pluto and its moons the rated power is 700121000000000000021 watts though not all instruments operate simultaneously in addition new horizons has an ultrastable oscillator subsystem which may be used to study and test the pioneer anomaly towards the end of the spacecrafts life.nnlong-range

burned for 9 minutes 47 seconds the atk star 48b third stage ignited at 19:42:37 utc and burned for 1 minute 28 seconds combined these burns successfully sent the probe on a solar-escape trajectory at 16.26 kilometers per second 58,536 km/h 36,373 mph new horizons took only nine hours to pass the moons orbit although there were backup launch opportunities in february 2006 and february 2007 only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the jupiter flyby any launch outside that period would have forced the spacecraft to fly a slower trajectory directly to pluto delaying its encounter by five to six years.nthe probe was launched by a lockheed martin atlas v 551 rocket with a third stage added to increase the heliocentric escape speed this was the first launch of the atlas v 551 configuration which uses five solid rocket boosters and the first atlas v with a third stage previous flights had used zero two or three solid boosters but never five the vehicle av-010 weighed 573,160 kilograms 1,263,600 lb at lift-off and had earlier been slightly damaged when hurricane wilma swept across florida on october 24 2005 one of the solid rocket boosters was hit by a door the

encountereditnmain article exploration of jupitern infrared image of jupiter by new horizonsnnew horizons used lorri to take its first photographs of jupiter on september 4 2006 from a distance of 291 million kilometers 181 million miles more detailed exploration of the system began in january 2007 with an infrared image of the moon callisto as well as several black-and-white images of jupiter itself new horizons received a gravity assist from jupiter with its closest approach at 05:43:40 utc on february 28 2007 when it was 2.3 million kilometers 1.4 million miles from jupiter the flyby increased new horizons speed by 4 km/s 14,000 km/h 9,000 mph accelerating the probe to a velocity of 23 km/s 83,000 km/h 51,000 mph relative to the sun and shortening its voyage to pluto by three years.nthe flyby was the center of a four-month intensive observation campaign lasting from january to june being an ever-changing scientific target jupiter has been observed intermittently since the end of the galileo mission in september 2003 knowledge about jupiter benefited from the fact that new horizons instruments were built using the latest technology especially in the area of cameras representing a significant improvement over galileos cameras which were modified versions of voyager cameras which in turn were modified mariner cameras the jupiter encounter also served as a shakedown and dress rehearsal for the pluto encounter because jupiter is much closer to earth than pluto the communications link can transmit multiple loadings of the memory buffer thus the mission returned more data from the jovian system than it was expected to transmit from pluto.none of the main goals during the jupiter encounter was observing its atmospheric conditions and analyzing the structure and composition of its clouds heat-induced lightning strikes in the polar regions and waves that indicate violent storm activity were observed and measured the little red spot spanning up to 70 of earths diameter was imaged from up close for the first time recording from different angles and illumination conditions new horizons took detailed images of jupiters faint ring system discovering debris left over from recent collisions within the rings or from other unexplained phenomena the search for undiscovered moons within the rings showed no results travelling through jupiters magnetosphere new horizons collected valuable particle readings bubbles of plasma that are thought to be formed from material ejected by the moon io were noticed in the magnetotail.nnjovian moonseditnthe four largest moons of jupiter were in poor positions for observation the necessary path of the gravity-assist maneuver meant that new horizons passed millions of kilometers from any of the galilean moons still its instruments were intended for small dim targets so they were scientifically useful on large distant moons emphasis was put on jupiters innermost galilean moon io whose active volcanoes shoot out tons of material into jupiters magnetosphere and further out of eleven observed eruptions three were seen for the first time that of tvashtar reached an altitude of up to 330 km 210 mi the event gave scientists an unprecedented look into the structure and motion of the rising plume and its subsequent fall back to the surface infrared signatures of a further 36 volcanoes were noticed callistos surface was analyzed with leisa revealing how lighting and viewing conditions affect infrared spectrum readings of its surface water ice minor moons such as amalthea

journey towards pluto in hibernation mode redundant components as well as guidance and control systems were shut down to extend their life cycle decrease operation costs and free the deep space network for other missions during hibernation mode the onboard computer monitored the probes systems and transmitted a signal back to earth a green code if everything was functioning as expected or a red code if mission controls assistance was needed the probe was activated for about two months a year so that the instruments could be calibrated and the systems checked the first hibernation mode cycle started on june 28 2007 the second cycle began on december 16 2008 the third cycle on august 27 2009 and the fourth cycle on august 29 2014 after a 10-week test.nnew horizons crossed the orbit of saturn on june 8 2008 and uranus on march 18 2011 after astronomers announced the discovery of two new moons in the pluto system kerberos and styx mission planners started contemplating the possibility of the probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons a study based on 18 months of computer simulations earth-based telescope observations and occultations of the pluto system revealed that the possibility of a catastrophic collision with debris or dust was less than 0.3 on the probes scheduled course if the hazard increased new horizons could have used one of two possible contingency plans the so-called shbots safe haven by other trajectories the probe could have continued on its present trajectory with the antenna facing the incoming particles so the more vital systems would be protected or it could have positioned its antenna to make a course correction that would take it just 3000 km from the surface of pluto where it was expected that the atmospheric drag would have cleaned the surrounding space of possible debris.nwhile in hibernation mode in july 2012 new horizons started gathering scientific data with swap pepssi and vbsdc although it was originally planned to activate just the vbsdc other instruments were powered on the initiative of principal investigator alan stern who decided they could use the opportunity to collect valuable heliospheric data before activating the other two instruments ground tests were conducted to make sure that the expanded data gathering in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy memory and fuel in the future and that all systems are functioning during the flyby the first set of data was transmitted in january 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation the command and data handling software was updated to address the problem of computer resets.nn possible neptune trojan targetseditnother possible targets were neptune trojans the probes trajectory to pluto passed near neptunes trailing lagrange point l which may host hundreds of bodies in 1:1 resonance in late 2013 new horizons passed within 1.2 au 180,000,000 km 110,000,000 mi of the high-inclination l5 neptune trojan 2011 hm102 which was identified shortly before by the new horizons kbo search survey team while searching for more distant objects for new horizons to fly by after its 2015 pluto encounter at that range 2011 hm would have been bright enough to be detectable by new horizons lorri instrument however the new horizons team eventually decided that they would not target 2011 hm for observations because the preparations for the pluto approach took precedence.nnobservations of pluto and charon 201314editnimages from july 1 to 3 2013 by lorri were the first by the probe to resolve pluto and charon as separate objects on july 14 2014 mission controllers performed a sixth trajectory-correction maneuver tcm since its launch to enable the craft to reach pluto between july 1924 2014 new horizons lorri snapped 12 images of charon revolving around pluto covering almost one full rotation at distances ranging from about 429 to 422 million kilometers 267,000,000 to 262,000,000 mi in august 2014 astronomers made high-precision measurements of plutos location and orbit around the sun using the atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array alma to help nasas new horizons spacecraft accurately home in on pluto on december 6 2014 mission controllers sent a signal for the craft to wake up from its final pluto-approach hibernation and begin regular operations the crafts response that it was awake arrived to earth on december 7 2014 at 02:30 utc.nnpluto approacheditnpluto and charon photographed on april 9 2015 left by ralph and on june 29 2015 right by lorri.ndistant-encounter operations at pluto began on january 4 2015 at this date images of the targets with the onboard lorri imager plus the ralph telescope would only be a few pixels in width investigators began taking pluto and background starfield images to assist mission navigators in the design of course-correcting engine maneuvers that would precisely modify the trajectory of new horizons to aim the approach on january 15 2015 nasa gave a brief update of the timeline of the approach and departure phases.non february 12 2015 nasa released new images of pluto taken from january 25 to 31 from the approaching probe new horizons was more than 203 million kilometers 126,000,000 mi away from pluto when it began taking the photos which showed pluto and its largest moon charon the exposure time was too short to see plutos smaller much fainter moons.ninvestigators compiled a series of images of the moons nix and hydra taken from january 27 through february 8 2015 beginning at a range of 201 million kilometers 125,000,000 mi pluto and charon appear as a single overexposed object at the center the right side image has been processed to remove the background starfield the yet smaller two moons kerberos and styx were seen on photos taken on april 25 starting may 11 a hazard search was performed by looking for unknown objects that could be a danger to the spacecraft such as rings or more moons which were possible to avoid by a course change.nalso in regards to the approach phase during january 2015 on august 21 2012 the team announced that they would spend mission time attempting long-range observations of the kuiper belt object temporarily designated vnh0004 now designated 2011 kw48 when the object was at a distance from new horizons of 75 gigameters 0.50 au the object would be too distant to resolve surface features or take spectroscopy but it would be able to make observations that cannot be made from earth namely a phase curve and a search for small moons a second object was planned to be observed in june 2015 and a third in september after the flyby the team hoped to observe a dozen such objects through 2018 on april 15 2015 pluto was imaged showing a possible polar cap.nnsoftware glitcheditnon july 4 2015 new horizons experienced a software anomaly and went into safe mode preventing the spacecraft from performing scientific observations until engineers could resolve the problem on july 5 nasa announced that the problem was determined to be a timing flaw in a command sequence used to prepare the spacecraft for its flyby and the spacecraft would resume scheduled science operations on july 7 the science observations lost because of the anomaly were judged to have no impact on the missions main objectives and minimal impact on other objectives.nthe timing flaw consisted of performing two tasks simultaneouslycompressing previously acquired data to release space for more data and making a second copy of the approach command sequencethat together overloaded the spacecrafts primary computer after the overload was detected the spacecraft performed as designed it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer entered safe mode and sent a distress call back to earth the distress call was received the afternoon of july 4 which alerted engineers that they needed to contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue the resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach and was not expected to happen again because no similar tasks were planned for the remainder of the encounter.nnpluto system encountereditn alan stern and the new horizons team celebrate after the spacecraft successfully completed its flyby of pluto.nthe closest approach of the new horizons spacecraft to pluto occurred at 11:49 utc on july 14 2015 at a range of 12,472 km 7,750 mi from the surface and 13,658 km 8,487 mi from the center of pluto telemetry data confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft were received on earth from the vicinity of the pluto system on july 15 2015 00:52:37 utc after 22 hours of planned radio silence due to the spacecraft being pointed toward the pluto system mission managers estimated a one in 10,000 chance that debris could have destroyed it during the flyby preventing it from sending data to earth the first details of the encounter were received the next day but the download of the complete data set through the 2 kbps data downlink took just over 15 months and analysis of the data will take longer.nnobjectiveseditnthe missions science objectives are grouped in three distinct priorities the primary objectives were required the secondary objectives were expected to be met but were not demanded the tertiary objectives were desired these objectives could have been skipped in favor of the above objectives an objective to measure any magnetic field of pluto was dropped a magnetometer instrument could not be implemented within a reasonable mass budget and schedule and swap and pepssi could do an indirect job detecting some magnetic field around pluto.nnn"the new horizons flyby of

approach and came as close as 28,800 km 17,900 mi to charon starting 3.2 days before the closest approach long-range imaging included the mapping of pluto and charon to 40 km 25 mi resolution this is half the rotation period of the plutocharon system and allowed imaging of all sides of both bodies close range imaging was repeated twice per day in order to search for surface changes caused by localized snow fall or surface cryovolcanism because of plutos tilt a portion of the northern hemisphere would be in shadow at all times during the flyby engineers expected lorri to be able to obtain select images with resolution as high as 50 m per pixel 160 ft/px if closest distance were around 12,500 km and mvic was expected to obtain four-color global dayside maps at 1.6 km 1 mi resolution lorri and mvic attempted to overlap their respective coverage areas to form stereo pairs leisa obtained hyperspectral near-infrared maps at 7 km/px 4.3 mi/px globally and 0.6 km/px 0.37 mi/px for selected areas.nn patterns of blue-gray ridges and reddish material observed in the tartarus dorsa region on july 14 2015nmeanwhile alice characterized the atmosphere both by emissions of atmospheric molecules airglow and by dimming of background stars as they pass behind pluto occultation during and after closest approach swap and pepssi sampled the high atmosphere and its effects on the solar wind vbsdc searched for dust inferring meteoroid collision rates and any invisible rings rex performed active and passive radio science the communications dish on earth measured the disappearance and reappearance of the radio occultation signal as the probe flew by behind pluto the results resolved plutos diameter by their timing and atmospheric density and composition by their weakening and strengthening pattern alice can perform similar occultations using sunlight instead of radio beacons previous missions had the spacecraft transmit through the atmosphere to earth downlink plutos mass and mass distribution were evaluated by the gravitational tug on the spacecraft as the spacecraft speeds up and slows down the radio signal exhibited a doppler shift the doppler shift was measured by comparison with the ultrastable oscillator in the communications electronics.nreflected sunlight from charon allowed some imaging observations of the nightside backlighting by the sun gave an

with the kuiper belt in betweennthe new horizons team requested and received a mission extension through 2021 to explore additional kuiper belt objects kbos funding was secured on july 1 2016 during this kuiper belt extended mission kem the spacecraft has performed a close fly-by of 486958 2014 mu69 and will conduct more distant observations on an additional two dozen objects and possibly make a fly-by of another kbo.nnkuiper belt object missioneditntarget backgroundeditnmission planners searched for one or more additional kuiper belt objects kbos of the order of 50100 km 3162 mi in diameter as targets for flybys similar to the spacecrafts plutonian encounter however despite the large population of kbos many factors limited the number of possible targets because the flight path was determined by the pluto flyby and the probe only had 33 kilograms of hydrazine propellant remaining the object to be visited needed to be within a cone of less than a degrees width extending from pluto the target also needed to be within 55 au because beyond 55 au the communications link will become too weak and the rtg power output will have decayed significantly enough to hinder observations desirable kbos would be well over 50 km 30 mi in diameter neutral in color to contrast with the reddish pluto and if possible have a moon that imparts a wobble.nnsearcheditnin 2011 mission scientists started a dedicated search for suitable kbos using ground telescopes large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras notably the twin 6.5-meter magellan telescopes in chile the 8.2-meter subaru observatory in hawaii and the canadafrancehawaii telescope were used to search for potential targets by participating in a citizen-science project called ice hunters the public helped to scan telescopic images for possible suitable mission candidates the ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 kbos of potential interest but none of these were close enough to the flight path of new horizons only the hubble space telescope was deemed likely to find a suitable target in time for a successful kbo mission on june 16 2014 time on hubble was granted for a search hubble has a much greater ability to find suitable kbos than ground telescopes the probability that a target for new horizons would be found was estimated beforehand at about 95%.nnsuitable kboseditn 486958 2014

pt2 and pt3 by the new horizons team all are objects with estimated diameters in the 3055 km 1934 mi range and were too small to be seen by ground telescopes each were at distances from the sun of ranging from 43 to 44 au which would put the encounters in the 20182019 period the initial estimated probabilities that these objects were reachable within new horizons fuel budget are 100 7 and 97 respectively all are members of the cold low-inclination low-eccentricity classical kuiper belt and thus are very different from pluto pt1 given the temporary designation 1110113y on the hst web site the most favorably situated object has a magnitude of 26.8 is 3045 km 1928 mi in diameter and was encountered in january 2019 a course change to reach it required about 35 of new horizons available trajectory-adjustment fuel supply a mission to pt3 was in some ways preferable in that it is brighter and therefore probably larger than pt1 but the greater fuel requirements to reach it would have left less for maneuvering and unforeseen events once sufficient orbital information was provided the minor planet center gave provisional designations to the three target kbos 2014 mu69 pt1 2014 os393 pt2 and 2014 pn70 pt3 by the fall of 2014 a possible fourth target 2014 mt69 had been eliminated by follow-up observations pt2 was out of the running before the pluto flyby the spacecraft will also study almost 20 kbos from afar.nnkbo selectioneditnon august 28 2015 486958 2014 mu pt1 was chosen as the flyby target the necessary course adjustment was performed with four engine firings between

data rate of 12 kilobits per second.nnpost 2014 mu encounter eventseditn new horizons position as of december 2018nafter the spacecrafts passage by 2014 mu the instrument continues to have sufficient power to be operational until the 2030s team leader alan stern stated the potential for a third flyby in the 2020s at the outer edges of the kuiper belt this depends on a suitable kuiper belt object still to be found or confirmed close enough to the spacecrafts current trajectory.nin addition new horizons may take a picture of earth from its distance in the kuiper belt but only after completing all planned kbo flybys this is because pointing a camera towards earth risks it being damaged by sunlight.nnspeededitn speed and distance from the sunnnew horizons has been called the fastest spacecraft ever launched because it left earth at 16.26 kilometers per second 58,536 km/h 36,373 mph faster than any other spacecraft it is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory which requires an approximate speed while near earth of 16.5 km/s 59,000 km/h 37,000 mph plus additional delta-v to cover air and gravity drag all to be provided by the launch vehicle.nhowever it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the solar system as of january 2018 this record is held by voyager 1 traveling at 16.985 km/s 61,146 km/h 37,994 mph relative to the sun voyager 1 attained greater hyperbolic excess velocity than new horizons thanks to gravity assists by jupiter and saturn when new horizons reaches the distance of 7013149597870700000100 au it will be travelling at about 13 km/s 47,000 km/h 29,000 mph around 4 km/s 14,000 km/h 8,900 mph slower than voyager 1 at that distance the parker solar probe can also be measured as the fastest object because of its orbital speed relative to the sun at perihelion 95.3 km/s 343,000 km/h 213,000 mph because it remains in solar orbit its specific orbital energy relative to the sun is lower than new horizons and other artificial objects escaping the solar system.nnnew horizons star 48b third stage is also on a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the solar system and reached jupiter before the new horizons spacecraft it was expected to cross plutos orbit on october 15 2015 because it is not in controlled flight it did not receive the correct gravity assist and passed within 200 million km 120 million mi of pluto the centaur second stage did not achieve solar escape velocity and remains in a heliocentric orbit.nngalleryeditnimages of the launcheditnthe atlas v 551 rocket used to launch new horizons
