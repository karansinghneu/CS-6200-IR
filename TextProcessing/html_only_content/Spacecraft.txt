launch which had a white external tank shownna spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes including communications earth observation meteorology navigation space colonization planetary exploration and transportation of humans and cargo all spacecraft except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own and require a launch vehicle carrier rocketnon a sub-orbital spaceflight a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface without having gone into an orbit for orbital spaceflights spacecraft enter closed orbits around the earth or around other celestial bodies spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit space stations only whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites only a handful of interstellar probes such as pioneer 10 and 11 voyager 1 and 2 and new horizons are on trajectories that leave the solar system.norbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not by method of reentry to earth they may be divided in non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes.nhumanity has achieved space flight but only

first artificial satellite sputnik 1 it was launched by the soviet unionna german v-2 became the first spacecraft when it reached an altitude of 189 km in june 1944 in peenemnde germany sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite it was launched into an elliptical low earth orbit leo by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 the launch ushered in new political military technological and scientific developments while the sputnik launch was a single event it marked the start of the space age apart from its value as a technological first sputnik 1 also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layers density through measuring the satellites orbital changes it also provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere pressurized nitrogen in the satellites false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection sputnik 1 was launched during the international geophysical year from site no.1/5 at the 5th tyuratam range in kazakh ssr now at the baikonur cosmodrome the satellite travelled at 29,000 kilometers 18,000 mi per hour taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002 mhznwhile sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the earth other man-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100 km which is the height required by the international organization fdration aronautique internationale to count as a spaceflight this altitude is called the krmn line in particular in the 1940s there were several test launches of the v-2 rocket some of which reached altitudes well over 100 km.nnspacecraft

usa and china nthe first crewed spacecraft was vostok 1 which carried soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin into space in 1961 and completed a full earth orbit there were five other crewed missions which used a vostok spacecraft the second crewed spacecraft was named freedom 7 and it performed a sub-orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying american astronaut alan shepard to an altitude of just over 187 kilometers 116 mi there were five other crewed missions using mercury spacecraft.nother soviet crewed spacecraft include the voskhod soyuz flown un crewed as zond/l1 l3 tks and the salyut and mir crewed space stations other american crewed spacecraft include the gemini spacecraft apollo spacecraft the skylab space station and the space shuttle with undetached european spacelab and private us

crewed orbital spacecraft were space capsules.nnnthe international space station crewed since november 2000 is a joint venture between russia the united states canada and several other countries.nnspaceplaneseditnmain article spaceplanen columbia orbiter landingnsome reusable vehicles have been designed only for crewed spaceflight and these are often called spaceplanes the first example of such was the north american x-15 spaceplane which conducted two crewed flights which reached an altitude of over 100 km in the 1960s the first reusable spacecraft the x-15 was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on july 19 1963.nthe first partially reusable orbital spacecraft a winged non-capsule the space shuttle was launched by the usa on the 20th anniversary of yuri gagarins flight on april 12 1981 during the shuttle era six orbiters were built all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests launching from the back of a boeing 747 sca and gliding to deadstick landings at edwards afb california the first space shuttle to fly into space was columbia followed by challenger discovery atlantis and endeavour endeavour was built to replace challenger when it was lost in january 1986 columbia broke up during reentry in february 2003.nthe first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the buran-class shuttle launched by the ussr on november 15 1988 although it made only one flight and this was uncrewed this spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the u.s space shuttle although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the american shuttle lack of funding complicated by the dissolution of the ussr prevented any further flights of buran the space shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous re-entry in case of necessity.nper the vision for space exploration the space shuttle was retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight the shuttles human transport role is to be replaced by spacexs dragon v2 and boeings cst-100 starliner no later than 2017 the shuttles heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the space launch system and spacexs falcon heavy.nscaled composites spaceshipone was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots mike melvill and brian binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the ansari x prize the spaceship
