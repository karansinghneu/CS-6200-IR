us air force project of the 1960s see space launching system for turkeys ufs satellite launcher see space launch system turkey.nnnnthe space launch system sls is an american space shuttle-derived super heavy-lift expendable launch vehicle it is part of nasas deep space exploration plans including a crewed mission to mars sls follows the cancellation of the constellation program and is to replace the retired space shuttle the nasa authorization act of 2010 envisions the transformation of the constellation programs ares i and ares v vehicle designs into a single launch vehicle usable for both crew and cargo similar to the ares iv concept the sls is to be the most powerful rocket ever built with a total thrust greater than that of the saturn v although saturn v could carry a greater payload mass.nthe sls launch vehicle is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions its initial block 1 version is to lift a payload of 95 metric tons to low earth orbit leo which will be increased with the debut of block 1b and the exploration upper stage block 2 will replace the initial shuttle-derived boosters with advanced boosters and is planned to have a leo capability of more than 130 metric tons to meet the congressional requirement these upgrades will allow the sls to lift astronauts and hardware to destinations beyond leo on a circumlunar trajectory as part of exploration mission 1 2 with block 1 to deliver elements of the lunar orbital platform-gateway lop-g with block 1b and to mars with block 2 the sls will launch the orion crew and service module and may support trips to the international space station if necessary sls will use the ground operations and launch facilities at nasas kennedy space center florida.nncontentsnnndesign and developmenteditn space launch systems planned upgrade pathnon september 14 2011 nasa announced its design selection for the new launch system declaring that it in combination with the orion spacecraft would take the agencys astronauts farther into space than ever before and provide the cornerstone for future us human space exploration efforts.nduring the early development of the sls a number of configurations were considered including a block 0 variant with three main engines a block 1a variant that would have upgraded the vehicles boosters instead of its second stage and a block 2 with five main engines and a different second stage the earth departure stage with up to three j-2x engines in february 2015 it was reported that nasa evaluations showed over performance versus the baseline payload for block 1 and block 1b configurations.nthree versions of the sls launch vehicle are planned block 1 block 1b and block 2 each will use the same core stage with four main engines but block 1b will feature a more powerful second stage called the exploration upper stage eus and block 2 will combine the eus with upgraded boosters block 1 has a baseline leo payload capacity of 95 metric tons 105 short tons and block 1b has a baseline of 105 metric tons 116 short tons the proposed block 2 will have lift capacity of 130 metric tons 140 short tons which is similar to that of the saturn v some sources state this would make the sls the most capable heavy lift vehicle built although the saturn v lifted approximately 140 metric tons 150 short tons to leo in the apollo 17 mission.non july 31 2013 the sls passed the preliminary design review pdr the review encompassed all aspects of the slss design not only the rocket and boosters but also ground support and logistical arrangements on august 7 2014 the sls block 1 passed a milestone known as key decision point c and entered full-scale development with an estimated launch date of november 2018 in april 2017 nasa announced that the schedule for the maiden flight would slip to 2019 in november 2017 the em-1 maiden flight slipped further to june 2020.nnvehicle descriptioneditn artists rendering of a sls block 1ncore stageeditnthe space launch systems core stage will be 8.4 meters 28 ft in diameter and use four rs-25 engines initial flights will use modified rs-25d engines left over from the space shuttle program later flights are expected to switch to a cheaper version of the engine not intended for reuse the stages structure will consist of a modified space shuttle external tank with the aft section adapted to accept the rockets main propulsion system mps and the top converted to host an interstage structure it will be fabricated at the michoud assembly facility.nthe core stage will be common across all currently planned evolutions of the sls initial planning included studies of a smaller block 0 configuration with three rs-25 engines which was eliminated to avoid the need to substantially redesign the core stage for more powerful variants likewise while early block 2 plans included five rs-25 engines on the core it was later baselined with four engines.nnboosterseditnplay media sls booster test in the utah desertnshuttle-derived boosterseditnblocks 1 and 1b of the sls will use two five-segment solid rocket boosters srbs which are based on the four-segment space shuttle solid rocket boosters modifications for the sls included the addition of a center booster segment new avionics and new insulation which eliminates the shuttle srbs asbestos and is 860 kg 1,900 lb lighter the five-segment srbs provide approximately 25 more total impulse than the shuttle srb and will not be recovered after use.norbital atk formerly alliant techsystems part of northrop grumman since mid-2018 has completed full-duration static fire tests of five-segment srbs these include successful firings of three developmental motors dm-1 to dm-3 from 2009 to 2011 the dm-2 motor was cooled to a core temperature of 40 f 4 c and dm-3 was heated to above 90 f 32 c to validate performance at extreme temperatures qualification motor 1 qm-1 was tested on march 10 2015 qualification motor 2 was successfully tested on june 28 2016 it was the final ground test before exploration mission 1 em-1.nnadvanced boosterseditnfor block 2 nasa plans to switch from shuttle-derived five-segment srbs to advanced boosters this will occur after development of the exploration upper stage for block 1b early plans would have developed advanced boosters before an updated second stage this configuration was called block 1a by 2012 nasa planned to select these new boosters through an advanced booster competition which was to be held in 2015 several companies proposed boosters for this competition:nnnchristopher crumbly manager of nasas sls advanced development office in january 2013 commented on the booster competition the f-1 has great advantages because it is a gas generator and has a very simple cycle the oxygen-rich staged combustion cycle aerojets engine has great advantages because it has a higher specific impulse the russians have been flying oxygen-rich for a long time either one can work the solids of atk can work."nlater analysis showed the block 1a configuration would result in high acceleration which would be unsuitable for orion and could require a costly redesign of the block 1 core in 2014 nasa confirmed the development of block 1b instead of block 1a and called off the 2015 booster competition in february 2015 it was reported that sls is expected to fly with the five-segment srb until at least the late 2020s and modifications to launch pad 39b its flame trench and slss mobile launcher platform were evaluated based on sls launching with solid-fuel boosters.nnupper stageeditn an rl10 engine like the one pictured above will be used as the second stage engine in both the icps and eus upper stages.ninterim cryogenic propulsion stageeditnblock 1 scheduled to fly exploration mission 1 em-1 in 2020 will use the interim cryogenic propulsion stage icps this stage will be a modified delta iv 5meter delta cryogenic second stage dcss and will be powered by a single rl10b-2 block 1 will be capable of lifting 95 t in this configuration however the icps will be considered part of the payload and be placed into an initial 1,800 km by 93 km suborbital trajectory to ensure safe disposal of the core stage icps will perform an orbital insertion burn at apogee and then a translunar injection burn to send the uncrewed orion on a circumlunar excursion in may 2018 nasa updated the payload capability of the sls block 1 from 70 to 95 metric tons to low earth orbit.nnexploration upper stageeditnthe exploration upper stage eus was scheduled to fly on exploration mission 2 em-2 it was expected to be used by block 1b and block 2 and like the core stage have a diameter of 8.4 meters the eus is to be powered by four rl10 engines complete the sls ascent phase and then re-ignite to send its payload to destinations beyond low-earth orbit similar to the role performed by the saturn vs 3rd stage the j-2 powered s-ivb because of delays in building the mobile launch platform needed to hold the more powerful eus the em-2 flight might launch earlier than planned but it will not use the eus it will not carry a module for the lunar gateway and it will not orbit the moon.nnother upper stageseditn artists impression of the bimodal nuclear thermal rocket engines on the mars transfer vehicle mtv cold launched it would be assembled in-orbit

assembly building at michoud assembly facilitynin mid-november 2014 construction of the first sls rocket began using the new welding system in the south vertical assembly building at nasas michoud assembly facility where the core stage will be assembled.nthe sls will have the ability to tolerate a minimum of 13 tanking cycles due to launch scrubs and other launch delays before launch the assembled rocket is to be able to remain at the launch pad for a minimum of 180 days and can remain in stacked configuration for at least 200 days without destacking.nin january 2015 nasa began test firing rs-25 engines in preparation for use on sls tests continued throughout spring of 2015 further testing was conducted in 2016 and 2017.nmultiple facilities throughout the country have started full scale fabrication of different segments of the launch vehicle orbital atk began casting propellant for the solid rocket boosters and manufacturing parts for the boosters in 2016 the company test fired a solid rocket booster in early 2015 and a second booster in june 2016.nconfidence article builds for the core stage began on january 5 2016 and were expected to be completed in late january of that year once completed the test articles will be sent to ensure structural integrity at marshall spaceflight center the icps for em-1 was slated for assembly in late january 2016 and a structural test article was delivered to nasa in 2015 for confidence testing.nnprogram costs and fundingeditnduring the joint senate-nasa presentation in september 2011 it was stated that the sls program had a projected development cost of 18 billion through 2017 with 10 billion for the sls rocket 6 billion for the orion multi-purpose crew vehicle and 2 billion for upgrades to the launch pad and other facilities at kennedy space center these costs and schedule were considered optimistic in an independent 2011 cost assessment report by booz allen hamilton for nasa an unofficial 2011 nasa document estimated the cost of the program through 2025 to total at least 41bn for four 95 t launches 1 uncrewed 3 crewed with the 130 t version ready no earlier than 2030.nthe human exploration framework team heft estimated unit costs for block 0 at 1.6bn and block 1 at 1.86bn in 2010 however since these estimates were made the block 0 sls vehicle was dropped in late 2011 and the design was not completed the space review estimated the cost per launch at 5 billion depending on the rate of launches nasa announced in 2013 that the european space agency will build the orion service module.nnasa sls deputy project manager jody singer at marshall space flight center huntsville alabama stated in september 2012 that 500 million per launch is a reasonable target cost for sls with a relatively minor dependence of costs on launch capability by comparison a saturn v launch cost us$185 to us$189 million in 1969-1971 dollars or roughly 1.23 billion in 2016 dollars adjusted for inflation.non july 24 2014 government accountability office audit predicted that sls would not launch by the end of 2017 as originally planned since nasa had not been receiving sufficient funding.nin august 2014 as the sls program passed its key decision point c review and entered full development costs from february 2014 until its planned launch in september 2018 were estimated at 7.021 billion ground systems modifications and construction would require an additional 1.8 billion over the same time period as of february 2015 the orion spacecraft was expected to enter its key decision point c review in the first half of 2015.nfor fiscal year 2015 nasa received an appropriation of us$1.7 billion from congress for sls an amount that was approximately us$320 million greater than the amount requested by the obama administration.nin october 2018 nasas inspector general reported that the boeing sls stages contract portion accounting for over 40 percent of the 11.9 billion spent on the sls program as of august 2018 is expected to cost a total of us$8.9 billion by 2021 which is twice the initial planned amount.nnfunding history and planningeditnfor fiscal years 2011 through 2018 the sls program had expended funding totaling 13,999 million in nominal dollars this is equivalent to 15,109 million adjusting to 2018 dollars using the nasa new start inflation indices.nnnexcluded from the prior sls costs are:nnnincluded in the prior sls costs are:nnnfor 2019 to 2023 nasa notional yearly budgets for sls range from 2.1 to 2.3b a year as of late 2015 the sls program has a 70 confidence level for its first orion mission with astronauts by 2023 according to the associate administrator for nasa robert lightfoot.nas of mid-2018 the sls is scheduling its first test launch with no crew for mid-2020.nthere are no nasa estimates for the sls program recurring yearly costs once operational for a certain flight rate per year or for the resulting average costs per flight bill hill nasa manager of exploration systems development has indicated my top number for orion sls and the ground systems that support it is 2 billion or less annually nasa associate administrator william h gerstenmaier has indicated per mission costs must be derived from the data and are not directly available this was done by design to lower nasas expenditures."nncriticismeditnthe space access society space frontier foundation and the planetary society called for cancellation of the project in 201112 arguing that sls will consume the funds for other projects from the nasa budget and will not reduce launch costs u.s representative dana rohrabacher and others added that instead an orbital propellant depot should be developed and the commercial crew development program accelerated two studies one not publicly released from nasa and another from the georgia institute of technology show this option to be possibly cheaper.nothers suggest it will cost less to use an existing lower payload capacity rocket atlas v delta iv falcon 9 or the derivative falcon heavy with on-orbit assembly and propellant depots as needed rather than develop a new launch vehicle for space exploration without competition for the whole design the augustine commission proposed an option for a commercial 75 metric ton launcher with lower operating costs and noted that a 40 to 60 t launcher can support lunar exploration.nmars society founder robert zubrin who co-authored the mars direct concept suggested that a heavy lift vehicle should be developed for 5 billion on fixed-price requests for proposal zubrin also disagrees with those that say the u.s does not need a heavy-lift vehicle spacexs ceo elon musk stated in 2010 that he would personally guarantee that his company could build a launch vehicle in the 140150 t payload range for 2.5 billion or 300 million per launch but cautioned that this price tag did not include a potential upper-stage upgrade musk went on to start development of the fully reusable bfr super-heavy launcher and upper stage starship in the early 2010s because of this reusability musk claims that it will be the lowest cost super-heavy launcher ever made if the price per launch and payload capabilities for the bfr are anywhere near musks claimed capabilities the rocket will be substantially cheaper than the sls.nrep tom mcclintock and other groups argue that the congressional mandates forcing nasa to use space shuttle components for sls amounts to a de facto non-competitive single source requirement assuring contracts to existing shuttle suppliers and calling the government accountability office gao to investigate possible violations of the competition in contracting act cica opponents of the heavy launch vehicle have critically used the name senate launch system the competitive space task force in september 2011 said that the new government launcher directly violates nasas charter the space act and the 1998 commercial space act requirements for nasa to pursue the fullest possible engagement of commercial providers and to seek and encourage to the maximum extent possible the fullest commercial use of space".nin 2013 chris kraft the nasa mission control leader from the apollo era expressed his criticism of the system as well lori garver former nasa deputy administrator has called for cancelling the program phil plait has voiced his criticism of sls in light of ongoing budget tradeoffs between commercial crew development and sls budget also referring to earlier critique by garver.ndoubts have also been expressed about the utility and cost of depots patrick r chai and alan w wilhite of georgia tech presented a study early in 2011 estimating that depot tanks would lose about 12 million worth of propellant per month in low earth orbit if protected only with passive insulation."nthe planetary society accepted that a mars mission could be had with existing budgets.nnmissionseditnsee also proposed sls and
