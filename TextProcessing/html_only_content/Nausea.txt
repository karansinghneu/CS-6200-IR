while not painful it can be a debilitating symptom if prolonged and has been described as placing discomfort on the chest upper abdomen or back of the throat.nlike pain the purpose of nausea is to discourage the person or animal from repeating whatever caused the unpleasantness the memory of pain elicits safer or evasive actions the memory of nausea elicits revulsion towards whatever was eaten before vomiting it up even if it was not the cause of the nausea.nnausea is a non-specific symptom which means that it has many possible causes some common causes of nausea are motion sickness dizziness migraine fainting low blood sugar gastroenteritis stomach infection or food poisoning nausea is a side effect of many medications including chemotherapy or morning sickness in early pregnancy nausea may also be caused by anxiety disgust and depression.nmedications taken to prevent and treat nausea are called antiemetics the most commonly prescribed antiemetics in the us are promethazine metoclopramide and the newer extremely effective ondansetron the word nausea is from latin nausea from greek nausia nautia motion sickness feeling sick or queasy".nncontentsnnnncauseseditngastrointestinal infections 37 and food poisoning are the two most common causes of acute nausea and vomiting side effects from medications 3 and pregnancy are also relatively frequent there are many causes of chronic nausea nausea and vomiting remain undiagnosed in 10 of the cases aside from morning sickness there are no gender differences in complaints of nausea after childhood doctor consultations decrease steadily with age only a fraction of one percent of doctor visits by those over 65 are due to nausea.nngastrointestinaleditngastrointestinal infection is one of the most common causes of acute nausea and vomiting chronic nausea may be the presentation of many gastrointestinal disorders occasionally as the major symptom such as gastroesophageal reflux disease functional dyspepsia gastroparesis peptic ulcer celiac disease non-celiac gluten sensitivity crohns disease hepatitis upper gastrointestinal malignancy and pancreatic cancer uncomplicated helicobacter pylori infection does not cause chronic nausea.nnfood poisoningeditnfood poisoning usually causes an abrupt onset of nausea and vomiting one to six hours after ingestion of contaminated food and lasts for one to two days it is due to toxins produced by bacteria in food.nnmedicationseditnmany medications can potentially cause nausea some of the most frequently associated include cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for cancer and other diseases and general anaesthetic agents an old cure for migraine ergotamine is well known to cause devastating nausea in some patients a person using it for the first time will be prescribed an antiemetic for relief if needed.nnpregnancyeditnnausea or morning sickness is common during early pregnancy but may occasionally continue into the second and third trimesters in the first trimester nearly 80 of women have some degree of nausea pregnancy should therefore be considered as a possible cause of nausea in any women of child bearing age while usually it is mild and self-limiting severe cases known as hyperemesis gravidarum may require treatment.nndisequilibriumeditna number of conditions involving balance such as motion sickness and vertigo can lead to nausea and vomiting.nnpsychiatriceditnnausea may be caused by depression anxiety disorders and eating disorders.nnpotentially seriouseditnwhile most causes of nausea are not serious some serious conditions are associated with nausea these include pancreatitis small bowel obstruction appendicitis cholecystitis hepatitis addisonian crisis diabetic ketoacidosis increased intracranial pressure spontaneous intracranial hypotension brain tumors meningitis heart attack carbon monoxide poisoning and many others.nncomprehensive

historyeditntaking a thorough patient history may reveal important clues to the cause of nausea and vomiting if the patients symptoms have an acute onset then drugs toxins and infections are likely in contrast a long-standing history of nausea will point towards a chronic illness as the culprit the timing of nausea and vomiting after eating food is an important factor to pay attention to symptoms that occur within an hour of eating may indicate an obstruction proximal to the small intestine such as gastroparesis or pyloric stenosis an obstruction further down in the intestine or colon will cause delayed vomiting an infectious cause of nausea and vomiting such as gastroenteritis may present several hours to days after the food was ingested the contents of the emesis is a valuable clue towards determining the cause bits of fecal matter in the emesis indicate obstruction in the distal intestine or the colon emesis that is of a bilious nature greenish in color localizes the obstruction to a point past the stomach emesis of undigested food points to an obstruction prior to the gastric outlet such as achalasia or zenkers diverticulum if patient experiences reduced abdominal pain after vomiting then obstruction is a likely etiology however vomiting does not relieve the pain brought on by pancreatitis or cholecystitis.nnphysical exameditnit is important to watch out for signs of dehydration such as orthostatic hypotension and loss of skin turgor auscultation of the abdomen can produce several clues to the cause of nausea and vomiting a high-pitched tinkling sound indicates possible bowel obstruction while a splashing succussion sound is more indicative of gastric outlet obstruction eliciting pain on the abdominal exam when pressing on the patient may indicate an inflammatory process signs such as papilledema visual field losses or focal neurological deficits are red flag signs for elevated intracranial pressure.nndiagnostic testingeditnwhen a history and physical exam are not enough to determine the cause of nausea and vomiting certain diagnostic tests may prove useful a chemistry panel would be useful for electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities liver function tests and lipase would identify pancreaticobiliary diseases abdominal x-rays showing air-fluid levels indicate bowel obstruction while an x-ray showing air-filled bowel loops are more indicative of ileus more advanced imaging and procedures may be necessary such as a ct scan upper endoscopy colonoscopy barium enema or mri abnormal gi motility can be assessed using specific tests like gastric scintigraphy wireless motility capsules and small-intestinal manometry.nnpathophysiologyeditnresearch on nausea and vomiting has relied on using animal models to mimic the anatomy and neuropharmacologic features of the human body the physiologic mechanism of nausea is a complex process that has yet to be fully elucidated there are four general pathways that are activated by specific triggers in the human body that go on to create the sensation of nausea and vomiting.nnnsignals from any of these pathways then travel to the brainstem activating several structures including the nucleus of the solitary tract the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and central pattern generator these structures go on to signal various downstream effects of nausea and vomiting the bodys motor muscle responses involve halting the muscles of the gastrointestinal tract and in fact causing reversed propulsion of gastric contents towards the mouth while increasing abdominal muscle contraction autonomic effects involve increased salivation and the sensation of feeling faint that often occurs with nausea and vomiting.nntreatmenteditnif dehydration is present due to loss of fluids from severe vomiting rehydration with oral electrolyte solutions is preferred if this is not effective or possible intravenous rehydration may be required medical care is recommended if a person cannot keep any liquids down has symptoms more than 2 days is weak has a fever has stomach pain vomits more than two times in a day or does not urinate for more than 8 hours.nnmedicationseditnmany pharmacologic medications are available for the treatment of nausea there is no medication that is clearly superior to other medications for all cases of nausea the choice of antiemetic medication may be based on the situation during which the person experiences nausea for people with motion sickness and vertigo antihistamines and anticholinergics such as meclizine and scopolamine are particularly effective nausea and vomiting associated with migraine headaches respond best to dopamine antagonists such as metoclopramide prochlorperazine and chlorpromazine in cases of gastroenteritis serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron were found to suppress nausea and vomiting as well as reduce the need for iv fluid resuscitation the combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine is the first line treatment for pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting dimenhydrinate is an inexpensive and effective over the counter medication for preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting other factors to consider when choosing an antiemetic medication include the persons preference side-effect profile and cost.nnalternative medicineeditnin certain people cannabinoids may be effective in reducing chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting several studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids for nausea and vomiting in the advanced stages of illnesses such as cancer and aids.nin hospital settings topical anti-nausea gels are not indicated because of lack of research backing their efficacy topical gels containing lorazepam diphenhydramine and haloperidol are sometimes used for nausea but are not equivalent to more established therapies.nginger has also been shown to be potentially effective in treating several types of nausea.ntentative evidence supports acupuncture at point pc6.nnprognosiseditnthe outlook depends on the cause most people recover within few hours or a day while short-term nausea and vomiting are generally harmless they may sometimes indicate a more serious condition when associated with prolonged vomiting it may lead to dehydration or dangerous electrolyte imbalances or both repeated intentional vomiting characteristic of bulimia can cause stomach acid to wear away at the enamel in teeth.nnepidemiologyeditnnausea and or vomiting is the main complaint in 1.6 of visits to family physicians in australia however only 25 of people with nausea visit their family physician in australia nausea as opposed to vomiting occurs most frequently in persons aged 1524 years and is less common in other age groups.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
