space probe wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn abandoned 1974 probe pioneer h on display in the national air and space museumn diagram of extant solar system missionsna space probe is a robotic spacecraft that does not orbit earth but instead explores further into outer space a space probe may approach the moon travel through interplanetary space flyby orbit or land on other planetary bodies or enter interstellar space.nthe space agencies of the ussr now russia and ukraine the united states the european union japan china and india have collectively launched probes to several planets and moons of the solar system as well as to a number of asteroids and comets approximately 15 missions are currently operational.nnfurther information list of active solar system probesncontentsnnninterplanetary trajectorieseditnonce a probe has left the vicinity of earth its trajectory will likely take it along an orbit around the sun similar to the earths orbit to reach another planet the simplest practical method is a hohmann transfer orbit more complex techniques such as gravitational slingshots can be more fuel-efficient though they may require the probe to spend more time in transit some high delta-v missions such as those with high inclination changes can only be performed within the limits of modern propulsion using gravitational slingshots a technique using very little propulsion but requiring a considerable amount of time is to follow a trajectory on the interplanetary transport network.nnsome notable probeseditnnluna 9editnfirst man-made object

may have also been the first space probe to impact the surface of another planet although it is unclear whether it reached venus surface.nnvenera 7editnthe venera 7 probe was the first spacecraft to successfully soft land on another planet venus and to transmit data from there back to earth.nnmariner 9editnupon its arrival at mars on november 13 1971 mariner 9 became the first space probe to maintain orbit around another planet.nnn the huygens landing site on titannmars 3editnfirst soft landing on mars december 2 1971 the lander began transmitting to the mars 3 orbiter 90 seconds after landing after 20 seconds transmission stopped for unknown reasons.nnsojournereditnfirst successful rover on mars.nnspirit and opportunityeditnthe mars exploration rovers spirit and opportunity landed on mars to explore the martian surface and geology and searched for clues to past water activity on mars they were each launched in 2003 and landed in 2004 communication with spirit stopped on sol 2210 march 22 2010 jpl continued to attempt to regain contact until may 24 2011 when nasa announced that efforts to communicate with the unresponsive rover had ended opportunity arrived at endeavour crater on 9 august 2011 at a landmark called spirit point named after its rover twin after traversing 13 miles 21 km from victoria crater over a three-year period opportunity was declared dead on the fourteenth of february and has lasted for more than fifteen years on mars although the rovers were intended to last only three months.nnhalley armadaeditnthe first dedicated missions to a comet in this case to halleys comet during its 198586 journey through the inner solar system it was also the first massive international coordination of space probes on an interplanetary mission with probes specifically launched by the soviet now russian space agency european space agency and japans isas now integrated with nasda to jaxa.nniceeditnoriginally a solar observatory in the international sun-earth explorer series it was sent into solar orbit to make the first close observations of a comet comet giacobinizinner in 1985 as a prelude to studies of halleys comet.nnvegaeditntwo russian/french spacecraft they dropped landers and balloons first weather balloons deployed on another planet at venus before their rendezvous with halleys comet.nnsakigakeeditnthis japanese probe was the first non-us non-soviet interplanetary probe.nnsuiseieditna second japanese probe it made ultraviolet wavelength observations of the comet.nngiottoeditnthe first space probe to penetrate a comets coma and take close-up images of its nucleus.nngenesiseditnfirst solar wind sample return probe from sun-earth l1.nnstardusteditnfirst sample return probe from a comet tail.nnnear shoemakereditnfirst probe to land on an asteroid.nnhayabusaeditnfirst sample return probe to launch from an asteroid.nnrosettaeditnthe rosetta space probe flew by two asteroids and made a rendezvous and orbited comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko in november 2014.nnpioneer 10editnfirst probe to jupiter.nradio communications were lost with pioneer 10 on january 23 2003 because of the loss of electric power for its radio transmitter with the probe at a distance of 12 billion kilometers 80 au from earth.nnpioneer 11editnfirst probe to fly by saturn communications were later lost due to power constraints and vast distance.nnvoyager 1editn voyager 1s view of solar system artists impression.nvoyager 1 is a 733-kilogram probe launched september 5 1977 it visited jupiter and saturn and was the first probe to provide detailed images of the moons of these planets.nvoyager 1 is the farthest human-made object from earth traveling away from both the earth and the sun at a relatively faster speed than any other probe as of september 12 2013 voyager 1 is about 12 billion miles 19 billion kilometers from the sun.non august 25 2012 voyager 1 became the first human made object to enter interstellar space voyager 1 has not had a functioning plasma sensor since 1980 but a solar flare in 2012 allowed scientists from nasa to measure vibrations of the plasma surrounding the craft the vibrations allowed scientists to measure the plasma to be much denser than measurements taken in the far layers of our heliosphere thus concluding the craft had broken beyond the heliopause.nnvoyager 2editnvoyager 2 was launched by nasa on august 20 1977 the probes primary mission was to visit the ice giants uranus and neptune which it completed on october 2 1989 it is currently the only probe to have visited the ice giants it is the fourth of five spacecraft to have left the solar system it has been operational for 41 years and 2 months as of october 20 2018.nncassinihuygenseditncassinihuygens was a 5,712kg 12,593lb
