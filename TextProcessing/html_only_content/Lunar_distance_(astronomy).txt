navigation.nnlunar distance ld or also called earthmoon distance earthmoon characteristic distance or distance to the moon is a unit of measure in astronomy it is the average distance from the center of earth to the center of the moon more technically it is the mean semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit it may also refer to the time-averaged distance between the centers of the earth and the moon or less commonly the instantaneous earthmoon distance the lunar distance is approximately a quarter of a million miles 7008400000000000000400000 km.nthe mean semi-major axis has a value of 384,402 km 238,856 mi the time-averaged distance between earth and moon centers is 385,000.6 km 239,228.3 mi the actual distance varies over the course of the orbit of the moon from 356,500 km 221,500 mi at the perigee to 406,700 km 252,700 mi at apogee resulting in a differential range of 50,200 km 31,200 mi.nlunar distance is commonly used to express the distance to near-earth object encounters lunar distance is also an important astronomical datum the precision of this measurement to a few parts in a trillion has useful implications for testing gravitational theories such as general relativity and for refining other astronomical values such as earth mass earth radius and earths rotation the measurement is also useful in characterizing the lunar radius the mass of the sun and the distance to the sun.nmillimeter-precision measurements of the lunar distance are made by measuring the time taken for light to travel between lidar stations on the earth and retroreflectors placed on the moon the moon is spiraling away from the earth at an average rate of 3.8 cm 1.5 in per year as detected by the lunar laser ranging experiment by coincidence the diameter of corner cubes in retroreflectors on the moon is also 69983800000000000003.8 cm.nncontentsnnnvalueeditn distance between the earth and moon sizes and distance to scale.nnnvariationeditnthe instantaneous lunar distance is constantly changing in fact the true distance between the moon and earth can change as quickly as 700175000000000000075 meters per second or more than 70061000000000000001000 km in just 6 hours due to its non-circular orbit there are other effects that also influence the lunar distance some factors are described in this section.nnperturbations and eccentricityeditnthe distance to the moon can be measured to an accuracy of 69972000000000000002 mm over a 1-hour sampling period which results in an overall uncertainty of 699820000000000000023 cm for the average distance however due to its elliptical orbit with varying eccentricity the instantaneous distance varies with monthly periodicity furthermore the distance is perturbed by the gravitational effects of various astronomical bodies most significantly the sun and less so jupiter other forces responsible for minute perturbations are gravitational attraction to other planets in the solar system and to asteroids tidal forces and relativistic effects the effect of radiation pressure from the sun contributes an amount of 69973600000000000003.6 mm to the lunar distance.nalthough the instantaneous uncertainty is sub-millimeter the measured lunar distance can change by more than 700721000000000000021000 km from the mean value throughout a typical month these perturbations are well understood and the lunar distance can be accurately modeled over thousands of years.nn the moons distance from the earth and moon phases in 2014.moon phases 0 1 new moon 0.25 first quarter 0.5 full moon 0.75 last quarter.n variation of the distance between the centers of the moon and the earth over 700 days.nntidal dissipationeditnthrough the action of tidal forces angular momentum is slowly being transferred from the earths rotation to the moons orbit the result is that earths rate of spin is imperceptibly decreasing at a rate of 70002299999999999992.3 milliseconds/century and the lunar orbit is gradually expanding the current rate of recession is 70003805000000000003.8050.004 cm per year however it is believed that this rate has recently increased as a rate of 69911204172063258833.8 cm/year would imply that the moon is only 1.5 billion years old whereas scientific consensus assumes an age of about 4 billion years it is also believed that this anomalously high rate of recession may continue to accelerate.nit is predicted that the lunar distance will continue to increase until in theory the earth and moon become tidally locked this would occur when the duration of the lunar orbital period equals the rotational period of earth the two bodies would then be at equilibrium and no further rotational energy would be exchanged however models predict that 50 billion years would be required to achieve this configuration which is significantly longer than the expected lifetime of the solar system.nnorbital historyeditnthe average lunar distance is increasing which implies that the moon was closer in the past there is geological evidence that the average lunar distance was about 52 r i.e 52 x the radius of the earth or 205,000 miles during the precambrian era 2,500 million years bp.nthe giant impact hypothesis a widely accepted theory states that the moon was created as a result of a catastrophic impact between earth and another planet resulting in a re-accumulation of fragments at an initial distance of 3.8 r 15,000 miles in this theory the initial impact is assumed to have occurred 4.5 billion years ago.nnhistory of measurementeditnuntil the late 1950s all measurements of lunar distance were based on optical angular measurements the earliest accurate measurement was by hipparchus in the 2nd century bc the space age marked a turning point when the accuracy of our knowledge of this value was much improved during the 1950s and 1960s there were experiments using radar lasers spacecraft and computer modeling.nthis section is intended to illustrate some of the historically significant or otherwise interesting methods of determining the lunar distance and is not intended to be an exhaustive or all-encompassing list.nnparallaxeditnthe oldest method of determining the lunar distance involved measuring the angle between the moon and a chosen reference point from multiple locations simultaneously the synchronization can be coordinated by making measurements at a pre-determined time or during an event which is observable to all parties before accurate mechanical chronometers the synchronization event was typically a lunar eclipse or the moment when the moon crossed the meridian if the observers shared the same longitude this measurement technique is known as lunar parallax.nfor increased accuracy certain adjustments must be made such as adjusting the measured angle to account for refraction and distortion of light passing through the atmosphere.nnlunar eclipseeditnearly attempts to measure the distance to the moon exploited observations of a lunar eclipse combined with knowledge of earths radius and an understanding that the sun is much further than the moon by observing the geometry of a lunar eclipse the lunar distance can be calculated using trigonometry.nthe earliest accounts of attempts to measure the lunar distance using this technique were by greek astronomer and mathematician aristarchus of samos in the 4th century bc and later by hipparchus whose calculations produced a result of 5967 r 7008374977152000000233000265000 mi this method later found its way into the work of ptolemy who produced a result of 64 r 7008407164032000000253000 mi at its farthest point.nnmeridian crossingeditnan expedition by french astronomer a.c.d crommelin observed lunar transits through the meridian the moment when the moon crosses an imaginary great circle that passes directly overhead and through the celestial poles on the same night from two different locations careful measurements from 1905-1910 measured the angle of elevation at the moment when a specific lunar crater msting a crossed the meridian from stations at greenwich and at cape of good hope which share nearly the same longitude a distance was calculated with an uncertainty of 700430000000000000030 km and this remained the definitive lunar distance value for the next half century.nnoccultationseditnby recording the instant when the moon occults a background star or similarly measuring the angle between the moon and a background star at a predetermined moment the lunar distance can be determined as long as the measurements are taken from multiple locations of known separation.nastronomers okeefe and anderson calculated the lunar distance by observing four occultations from nine locations in 1952 they calculated a mean distance of 7008384407600000000384407.64.7 km however this value was refined in 1962 by irene fischer who incorporated updated geodetic data to produce a value of 7008384403700000000384403.72 km.nnradareditnan experiment was conducted in 1957 at the u.s naval research laboratory that used the echo from radar signals to determine the earth-moon distance radar pulses lasting 69942000000000000002 s were broadcast from a 700115240000000000050 ft diameter radio dish after the radio waves echoed off the surface of the moon the return signal was detected and the delay time measured from that measurement the distance could be calculated in practice however the signal-to-noise ratio was so low that an accurate measurement could not be reliably produced.nthe experiment was repeated in 1958 at the royal radar establishment in england radar pulses lasting 69944999999999999995 s were transmitted with a peak power of 2 megawatts at a repetition rate of 260 pulses per second after the radio waves echoed off the surface of the moon the return signal was detected and the delay time measured multiple signals were added together to obtain a reliable signal by superimposing oscilloscope traces onto photographic film from the measurements the distance was calculated with an uncertainty of 70031250000000000001.25 km.nthese initial experiments were intended to be proof-of-concept experiments and only lasted one day follow-on experiments lasting one month produced a mean value of 70083844020000000003844021.2 km which was the most accurate measurement of the lunar distance at the time.nnlaser rangingeditn lunar laser ranging experiment from the apollo 11 missionnan experiment which measured the round-trip time of flight of laser pulses reflected directly off the surface of the moon was performed in 1962 by a team from massachusetts institute of technology and a soviet team at the crimean astrophysical observatory.nduring the apollo missions in 1969 astronauts placed retroreflectors on the surface of the moon for the purpose of refining the accuracy of this technique the measurements are ongoing and involve multiple laser facilities the instantaneous accuracy of the lunar laser ranging experiments can exceed sub-millimeter resolution and is the most reliable method of determining the lunar distance to date.nnamateur astronomers and citizen scientistseditndue to the modern accessibility of accurate timing devices high resolution digital cameras gps receivers powerful computers and near-instantaneous communication it has become possible for amateur astronomers to make high accuracy measurements of the lunar distance.non may 23 2007 digital photographs of the moon during a near-occultation of regulus were taken from two locations in greece and england by measuring the parallax between the moon and the chosen background star the lunar distance was calculated.na more ambitious project called the aristarchus campaign was conducted during the lunar eclipse of 15 april 2014 during this event participants were invited to record a series of five digital photographs from moonrise until culmination the point of greatest altitude.nthe method took advantage of the fact that the moon is actually closest to an observer when it is at its highest point in the sky compared to when it is on the horizon although it appears that the moon is biggest when it is near the horizon the opposite is true this phenomenon is known as the moon illusion the reason for the difference in distance is that the distance from the center of the moon to the center of the earth is nearly constant throughout the night but an observer on the surface of earth is actually 1 earth radius from the center of earth this offset brings them closest to the moon when it is overhead.nmodern cameras have now reached a resolution level capable of capturing the moon with enough precision to perceive and more importantly to measure this tiny variation in apparent size the results of this experiment were calculated as ld 700160510000000000060.51+3.914.19 r the accepted value for that night was 60.61 which implied a 70003000000000000003 accuracy the benefit of this method is that the only measuring equipment needed is a modern digital camera equipped with an accurate clock and a gps receiver.nother experimental methods of measuring the lunar distance that can be performed by
