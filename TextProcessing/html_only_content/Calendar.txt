typically days weeks months and years a date is the designation of a single specific day within such a system a calendar is also a physical record often paper of such a system a calendar can also mean a list of planned events such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents such as a calendar of wills.nperiods in a calendar such as years and months are usually though not necessarily synchronised with the cycle of the sun or the moon the most common type of pre-modern calendar was the lunisolar calendar a lunar calendar that occasionally adds one intercalary month to remain synchronised with the solar year over the long term.nthe term calendar is taken from calendae the term for the first day of the month in the roman calendar related to the verb calare to call out referring to the calling of the new moon when it was first seen.nlatin calendarium meant account book register as accounts were settled and debts were collected on the calends of each month the latin term was adopted in old french as calendier and from there in middle english as calender by the 13th century the spelling calendar is early modern a calendar can be on paper or electronic

vento at fondachelli fantina sicilynthe course of the sun and the moon are the most salient natural regularly recurring events useful for timekeeping thus in pre-modern societies worldwide lunation and the year were most commonly used as time units nevertheless the roman calendar contained remnants of a very ancient pre-etruscan 10-month solar year the first recorded physical calendars dependent on the development of writing in the ancient near east are the bronze age egyptian and sumerian calendars.na large number of ancient near east calendar systems based on the babylonian calendar date from the iron age among them the calendar system of the persian empire which in turn gave rise to the zoroastrian calendar and the hebrew calendar.na great number of hellenic calendars developed in classical greece and in the hellenistic period gave rise to both the ancient roman calendar and to various hindu calendars.ncalendars in antiquity were lunisolar depending on the introduction of intercalary months to align the solar and the lunar years this was mostly based on observation but there may have been early attempts to model the pattern of intercalation algorithmically as evidenced in the fragmentary 2nd-century coligny calendar.nthe roman calendar was reformed by julius caesar in 45 bc the julian calendar was no longer dependent on the observation of the new moon but simply followed an algorithm of introducing a leap day every four years this created a dissociation of the calendar month from the lunation.nthe islamic calendar is based on the prohibition of intercalation nasi by muhammad in islamic tradition dated to a sermon held on 9 dhu al-hijjah ah 10 julian date 6 march 632 this resulted in an observation-based lunar calendar that shifts relative to the seasons of the solar year.nnmodern reformseditnmain article calendar reformnthe first calendar reform of the early modern era was the gregorian calendar introduced in 1582 based on the observation of a long-term shift between the julian calendar and the solar year.nthere have been a number of modern proposals for reform of the calendar such as the world calendar international fixed calendar holocene calendar and recently the hanke-henry permanent calendar such ideas are mooted from time to time but have failed to gain traction because of the loss of continuity massive upheaval in implementation and religious objections.nncalendar systemseditna full calendar system has a different calendar date for every day thus the week cycle is by itself not a full calendar system neither is a system to name the days within a year without a system for identifying the years.nthe simplest calendar system just counts time periods from a reference date this applies for the julian day or unix time virtually the only possible variation is using a different reference date in particular one less distant in the past to make the numbers smaller computations in these systems are just a matter of addition and subtraction.nother calendars have one or multiple larger units of time.ncalendars that contain one level of cycles:nnncalendars with two levels of cycles:nnncycles can be synchronized with periodic phenomena:nn sun and moon schedels nuremberg chronicle 1493nnvery commonly a calendar includes more than one type of cycle or has both cyclic and non-cyclic elements.nmost calendars incorporate more complex cycles for example the vast majority of them track years months weeks and days the seven-day week is practically universal though its use varies it has run uninterrupted for millennia.nnsolar calendarseditnmain article solar calendarnsolar calendars assign a date to each solar day a day may consist of the period between sunrise and sunset with a following period of night or it may be a period between successive events such as two sunsets the length of the interval between two such successive events may be allowed to vary slightly during the year or it may be averaged into a mean solar day other types of calendar may also use a solar day.nnlunar calendarseditnmain article lunar calendarnnot all calendars use the solar year as a unit a lunar calendar is one in which days are numbered within each lunar phase cycle because the length of the lunar month is not an even fraction of the length of the tropical year a purely lunar calendar quickly drifts against the seasons which do not vary much near the equator it does however stay constant with respect to other phenomena notably tides an example is the islamic calendar.nalexander marshack in a controversial reading believed that marks on a bone baton c 25,000 bc represented a lunar calendar other marked bones may also represent lunar calendars similarly michael rappenglueck believes that marks on a 15,000-year-old cave painting represent a lunar calendar.nnlunisolar calendarseditna lunisolar calendar is a lunar calendar that compensates by adding an extra month as needed to realign the months with the seasons an example is the hebrew calendar which uses a 19-year cycle.nncalendar subdivisionseditnsee also decade century and millenniumnnearly all calendar systems group consecutive days into months and also into years in a solar calendar a year approximates earths tropical year that is the time it takes for a complete cycle of seasons traditionally used to facilitate the planning of agricultural activities in a lunar calendar the month approximates the cycle of the moon phase consecutive days may be grouped into other periods such as the week.nbecause the number of days in the tropical year is not a whole number a solar calendar must have a different number of days in different years this may be handled for example by adding an extra day in leap years the same applies to months in a lunar calendar and also the number of months in a year in a lunisolar calendar this is generally known as intercalation even if a calendar is solar but not lunar the year cannot be divided entirely into months that never vary in length.ncultures may define other units of time such as the week for the purpose of scheduling regular activities that do not easily coincide with months or years many cultures use different baselines for their calendars starting years for example the year in japan is based on the reign of the current emperor 2006 was year 18 of the emperor akihito.nnother calendar typeseditnarithmetic and astronomical calendarseditn calendar of the qahal 5591 1831nan astronomical calendar is based on ongoing observation examples are the religious islamic calendar and the old religious jewish calendar in the time of the second temple such a calendar is also referred to as an observation-based calendar the advantage of such a calendar is that it is perfectly and perpetually accurate the disadvantage is that working out when a particular date would occur is difficult.nan arithmetic calendar is one that is based on a strict set of rules an example is the current jewish calendar such a calendar is also referred to as a rule-based calendar the advantage of such a calendar is the ease of calculating when a particular date occurs the disadvantage is imperfect accuracy furthermore even if the calendar is very accurate its accuracy diminishes slowly over time owing to changes in earths rotation this limits the lifetime of an accurate arithmetic calendar to a few thousand years after then the rules would need to be modified from observations made since the invention of the calendar.nncomplete and incomplete calendarseditnncalendars may be either complete or incomplete complete calendars provide a way of naming each consecutive day while incomplete calendars do not the early roman calendar which had no way of designating the days of the winter months other than to lump them together as winter is an example of an incomplete calendar while the gregorian calendar is an example of a complete calendar.nncalendars in useeditnthe primary practical use of a calendar is to identify days to be informed about or to agree on a future event and to record an event that has happened days may be significant for agricultural civil religious or social reasons for example a calendar provides a way to determine when to start planting or harvesting which days are religious or civil holidays which days mark the beginning and end of business accounting periods and which days have legal significance such as the day taxes are due or a contract expires also a calendar may by identifying a day
