flagship programs highly focused american scientific space missions that are exploring the solar system it was founded in 1992 to implement then-nasa administrator daniel s goldins vision of faster better cheaper planetary missions discovery missions differ from traditional nasa missions where targets and objectives are pre-specified instead these cost-capped missions are proposed and led by a scientist called the principal investigator pi proposing teams may include people from industry small businesses government laboratories and universities proposals are selected through a competitive peer review process all of the completed discovery missions are accomplishing ground-breaking science and adding significantly to the body of knowledge about the solar system.nnasa also accepts proposals for competitively selected discovery program missions of opportunity this provides opportunities to participate in non-nasa missions by providing funding for a science instrument or hardware components of a science instrument or to re-purpose an existing nasa spacecraft these opportunities are currently offered through nasas stand alone mission of opportunity program.non january 4 2017 nasa announced that the next discovery mission selection included the double-selection of lucy to visit several asteroids and trojans and psyche to visit the metal asteroid psyche as the thirteenth and fourteenth discovery missions respectively.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnin 1989 the solar system exploration division ssed at nasa headquarters initiated a series of workshops to define a new strategy for exploration through the year 2000 the panels included a small mission program group smpg that was chartered to devise a rationale for missions that would be low cost and allow focused scientific questions to be addressed in a relatively short time a fast-paced study for a potential mission was requested and funding arrangements were made in 1990 the new program was called discovery and the panel assessed a number of concepts that could be implemented as low-cost programs with near earth asteroid rendezvous near as the first mission to be implemented.non february 17 1996 near became the first mission to launch in the discovery program.nthe mars pathfinder launched on december 4 1996 demonstrated a number of innovative economical and highly effective approaches to spacecraft and planetary mission design such as the inflated airbags that allowed the sojourner rover to endure the landing note that the two mars exploration rovers opportunity and spirit were not a part of the discovery program although they did re-use the overall landing system of mars pathfinder also phoenix and maven were in the mars scout program and not the discovery program.nnmission

perhaps two dozen concepts these sometimes get further matured and re-proposed in another selection or program an example of this is suess-urey mission which was passed over in favor of the successful stardust mission but was eventually flown as genesis while a more extensive mission similar to inside was flown as juno in the new frontiers program some of these concepts went on to become actual missions or similar concepts were eventually realized in another mission class this list is a mix of previous and current proposals.nadditional examples of discovery-class mission proposals

follow the same selection process that started once the program was under-way mars pathfinder was salvaged from the idea for a technology and edl demonstrator from the mars environmental survey program also one of the goals of pathfinder was to support the mars surveyor program later missions would be selected by a more sequential process involving announcements of opportunity.nnear again has a slightly different background when discovery was established in 1990 soon after a working group for the program recommended that the first mission should be to a near-earth asteroid a series of proposals limited to missions to a near-earth asteroid missions was reviewed in 1991 what would be the near spacecraft mission was formally selected in december 1993 after which a 2-year development period would follow prior to launch near was launched on february 15 1996 and arrived to orbit asteroid eros on february 14 2000 mars pathfinder launched on december 4 1996 and would land on the planet mars on july 4 1997 bringing along with it the first nasa mars rover.nndiscovery 3 and 4editn thorium concentrations on the moon as mapped by lunar prospectornin august 1994 nasa made an

selected for launch three other missions were left to undergo a further selection later in 1995 for the fourth discovery mission stardust suess-urey and venus multiprobe stardust a comet sample return

late 2004 and the cost was constrained at about us$300 million each.nin 1998 five finalists had been selected to receive us$375,000 to further mature their design concept the five proposals were selected out of perhaps 30 with the goal of achieving the best science those missions were:nnnaladdin and messenger were also finalists in the 1997 selection.nndiscovery 9 and 10editn scale comparison

january 2001 for a phase-a design study dawn kepler and inside jupiter inside jupiter was similar to a later new frontiers mission called juno dawn was a mission to asteroids vesta and ceres and kepler was a space telescope mission aimed to discover extrasolar planets the three finalists received us$450,000 to further mature the mission proposal.nin december 2001 kepler and dawn were selected for flight by nasa at this time only 80 exoplanets had been detected and that was part of the mission of kepler to look for more exoplanets especially earth-sized both kepler and dawn were initially projected for launch in 2006.nthe discovery program fell on hard-times after this with several mission experiencing cost overruns and the contour mission experiencing an engine failure in orbit although both dawn and kepler would become widely praised success stories they missed their somewhat ambitious 2006 launch target launching in 2007 and 2009 respectively kepler would go on to receive a mission extensions and dawn likewise successfully orbited both vesta and ceres nevertheless the next selection would take longer than previous as the program selection of new missions slowed down as the successes of the new missions enhanced the image of the discovery program the difficulties began to fade from the limelight also the number of active missions in development or active began to increase as the program ramped up.nndiscovery 11editnthe announcement of opportunity for this discovery mission was released in april 2006 there were three finalists for this discovery selection including grail the eventual winner osiris and vesper osiris was very similar to the later osiris-rex mission an asteroid sample return mission to 101955 bennu and vesper a venus orbiter mission a previous proposal of vesper had also been a finalist in the 1998 round of selection the three finalists were announced in october 2006 and awarded us$1.2 million to further develop their proposals for the final round.nin november 2007 nasa selected the grail mission as the next discovery mission with a goal of mapping lunar gravity and a 2011 launch there were 23 other proposals that were also under consideration the mission had budget of us$375 million then-year dollars which included construction and also the launch.nndiscovery 12editn artists impression of proposed time lake lander for
