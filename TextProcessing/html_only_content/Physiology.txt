nature origin and logia meaning study of is the scientific study of the functions and mechanisms which work within a living system.nas a sub-discipline of biology the focus of physiology is on how organisms organ systems organs cells and biomolecules carry out the chemical and physical functions that exist in a living system.ncentral to an understanding of physiological functioning is the investigation of the fundamental biophysical and biochemical phenomena the coordinated homeostatic control mechanisms and the continuous communication between cells.nthe physiologic state is the condition occurring from normal body function while the pathological state is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases including humans.naccording to the type of investigated organisms the field can be divided into animal physiology including that of humans plant physiology cellular physiology and microbial physiology.nthe nobel prize in physiology or medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the royal swedish academy of sciences nncontentsnnnnfoundations of physiologyeditnnanimalseditnmain article zoology physiologynhumanseditnmain article human body physiologynhuman physiology seeks to understand the mechanisms that work to keep the human body alive and functioning through scientific enquiry into the nature of mechanical physical and biochemical functions of humans their organs and the cells of which they are composed the principal level of focus of physiology is at the level of organs and systems within systems the endocrine and nervous systems play major roles in the reception and transmission of signals that integrate function in animals homeostasis is a major aspect with regard to such interactions within plants as well as animals the biological basis of the study of physiology integration refers to the overlap of many functions of the systems of the human body as well as its accompanied form it is achieved through communication that occurs in a variety of ways both electrical and chemical.nchanges in physiology can impact the mental functions of individuals examples of this would be the effects of certain medications or toxic levels of substances change in behavior as a result of these substances is often used to assess the health of individuals.nmuch of the foundation of knowledge in human physiology was provided by animal experimentation due to the frequent connection between form and function physiology and anatomy are intrinsically linked and are studied in tandem as part of a medical curriculum.nnplantseditnmain article plant physiologyplant physiology is a subdiscipline of botany concerned with the functioning of plants closely related fields include plant morphology plant ecology phytochemistry cell biology genetics biophysics and molecular biology fundamental processes of plant physiology include photosynthesis respiration plant nutrition tropisms nastic movements photoperiodism photomorphogenesis circadian rhythms seed germination dormancy and stomata function and transpiration absorption of water by roots production of food in the leaves and growth of shoots towards light are examples of plant physiology.ncellseditnmain article cell physiologyalthough there are differences between animal plant and microbial cells the basic physiological functions of cells can be divided into the processes of cell division cell signaling cell growth and cell metabolism.nmicroorganismseditnmain article microorganismmicroorganisms can be found almost everywhere on earth types of microorganisms include archaea bacteria eukaryotes protists fungi and micro-plants microbes are important in human culture and health in many ways serving to ferment foods treat sewage produce fuel enzymes and other bioactive compounds they are essential tools in biology as model organisms and have been put to use in biological warfare and bioterrorism they are a vital component of fertile soils in the human body microorganisms make up the human microbiota including the essential gut flora they are the pathogens responsible for many infectious diseases and as such are the target of hygiene measures most microorganisms can reproduce rapidly and bacteria are also able to freely exchange genes through conjugation transformation and transduction even between widely divergent species.nviruseseditnmain article virusnhistoryeditnthe classical eraeditnthe study of human physiology as a medical field originates in classical greece at the time of hippocrates late 5th century bc noutside of western tradition early forms of physiology or anatomy can be reconstructed as having been present at around the same time in china india and elsewhere.nhippocrates incorporated his belief system called the theory of humours which consisted of four basic substance earth water air and fire each substance is known for having a corresponding humour black bile phlegm blood and yellow bile respectively hippocrates also noted some emotional connections to the four humours which claudius galenus would later expand on the critical thinking of aristotle and his emphasis on the relationship between structure and function marked the beginning of physiology in ancient greece like hippocrates aristotle took to the humoral theory of disease which also consisted of four primary qualities in life hot cold wet and dry claudius galenus c 130200 ad known as galen of pergamum was the first to use experiments to probe the functions of the body unlike hippocrates galen argued that humoral imbalances can be located in specific organs including the entire body his modification of this theory better equipped doctors to make more precise diagnoses galen also played off of hippocrates idea that emotions were also tied to the humours and added the notion of temperaments sanguine corresponds with blood phlegmatic is tied to phlegm yellow bile is connected to choleric and black bile corresponds with melancholy galen also saw the human body consisting of three connected systems the brain and nerves which are responsible for thoughts and sensations the heart and arteries which give life and the liver and veins which can be attributed to nutrition and growth galen was also the founder of experimental physiology and for the next 1,400 years galenic physiology was a powerful and influential tool in medicine.nnearly modern periodeditnjean fernel 14971558 a french physician introduced the term physiology galen ibn al-nafis michael servetus realdo colombo amato lusitano and william harvey are credited as making important discoveries in the circulation of the blood santorio santorio in 1610s was the first to use a device to measure the pulse rate the pulsilogium and a thermoscope to measure temperature.nin 1791 luigi galvani described the role of electricity in nerves of dissected frogs in 1811 julien jean csar legallois studied respiration in animal dissection and lesions and found the center of respiration in the medulla oblongata in the same year charles bell finished work on what would later become known as the bell-magendie law which compared functional differences between dorsal and ventral roots of the spinal cord in 1824 franois magendie described the sensory roots and produced the first evidence of the cerebellums role in equilibration to complete the bell-magendie law.nin the 1820s the french physiologist henri milne-edwards introduced the notion of physiological division of labor which allowed to compare and study living things as if they were machines created by the industry of man inspired in the work of adam smith milne-edwards wrote that the body of all living beings whether animal or plant resembles a factory where the organs comparable to workers work incessantly to produce the phenomena that constitute the life of the individual in more differentiated organisms the functional labor could be apportioned between different instruments or systems called by him as appareils.nin 1858 joseph lister studied the cause of blood coagulation and inflammation that resulted after previous injuries and surgical wounds he later discovered and implemented antiseptics in the operating room and as a result decreased death rate from surgery by a substantial amount.nthe physiological society was founded in london in 1876 as a dining club the american physiological society aps is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 1887 the society is devoted to fostering education scientific research and dissemination of information in the physiological sciences."nin 1891 ivan pavlov performed research on conditional responses that involved dogs saliva production in response to a bell and visual stimuli.nin the 19th century physiological knowledge began to accumulate at a rapid rate in particular with the 1838 appearance of the cell theory of matthias schleiden and theodor schwann it radically stated that organisms are made up of units called cells claude bernards 18131878 further discoveries ultimately led to his concept of milieu interieur internal environment which would later be taken up and championed as homeostasis by american physiologist walter b cannon in 1929 by homeostasis cannon meant the maintenance of steady states in the body and the physiological processes through which they are regulated in other words the bodys ability to regulate its internal environment william beaumont was the first american to utilize the practical application of physiology.nnineteenth century physiologists such as michael foster max verworn and alfred binet based on haeckels ideas elaborated what came to be called general physiology a unified science of life based on the cell actions later renamed in the 20th century as cell biology.nnlate modern periodeditnin the 20th century biologists became interested in how organisms other than human beings function eventually spawning the fields of comparative physiology and ecophysiology major figures in these fields include knut schmidt-nielsen and george bartholomew most recently evolutionary physiology has become a distinct subdiscipline.nin 1920 august krogh won the nobel prize for discovering how in capillaries blood flow is regulated.nin 1954 andrew huxley and hugh huxley alongside their research team discovered the sliding filaments in skeletal muscle known today as the sliding filament theory.nrecently there have been intense debates about the vitality of physiology as a discipline is it dead or alive if physiology is perhaps less visible nowadays than during the golden age of the 19th century it is in large part because the field has given birth to some of the most active domains of todays biological sciences such as neuroscience endocrinology and immunology furthermore physiology is still often seen as an integrative discipline which can put together into a coherent framework data coming from various different domains.nnnotable physiologistseditnmain article list of physiologistsnwomen in physiologyeditninitially women were largely excluded from official involvement in any physiological society the american physiological society for example was founded in 1887 and included only men in its ranks in 1902 the american physiological society elected ida hyde as the first female member of the society hyde a representative of the american association of university women and a global advocate for gender equality in education attempted to promote gender equality in every aspect of science and medicine.nsoon thereafter in 1913 j.s haldane proposed that women be allowed to formally join the physiological society which had been founded in 1876 on 3 july 1915 six women were officially admitted florence buchanan winifred cullis ruth c skelton sarah c m sowton constance leetham terry and enid m tribe the centenary of the election of women was celebrated in 2015 with
