contrasts with other narratives of the past such as mythological oral or archeological traditions for broader world history recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world around the 4th millennium bc and coincides with the invention of writing for some geographic regions or cultures written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records moreover human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals thus recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept because of this recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.nthe interpretation of recorded history often relies on historical method or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past the question of the nature and even the possibility of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the philosophy of history as a question of epistemology the study of different historical methods is known as historiography which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.nncontentsnnnprehistoryeditnfurther information history of writingnprehistory traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history ending with the invention of

writing however invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the bronze age in the late neolithic of the late 4th millennium bce the sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered the earliest writing systems both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 34003200 bce with earliest coherent texts from about 2600 bce.nnhistorical accountseditnmain article historiography the history of written historyn oracle bone of the shang dynasty ancient chinanthe earliest chronologies date back to

developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries especially in france and germany where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives in the 20th century academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives which often tended to glorify the nation or great men to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces a major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art which traditionally had been the case french historians associated with the annales school introduced quantitative history using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history.nsouth asiaeditnin sri lanka the oldest historical text is the mahavamsa buddhist monks of the anuradhapura maha viharaya maintained chronicles of sri lankan history starting from the third century bce these annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the

commentaries written in sinhala an earlier document known as the dipavamsa4th century ce island chronicles is much simpler and contains less information than the mahavamsa and was probably compiled using the atthakatha on the mahavamsa as well.na companion volume the culavamsa lesser chronicle compiled by sinhala monks covers the period from the 4th century to the british takeover of sri lanka

sociologist ibn khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed in this criticism he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation ibn khaldun often criticized idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data as a result he introduced a scientific method to the study of history and he often referred to it as his new science his historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state communication propaganda and systematic bias in history and he is thus considered to be the father of historiography or the father of the philosophy of history".nnmethods of recording historyeditnwhile recorded history begins with the invention of writing over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology history can now be recorded through photography audio recordings and video recordings more recently internet archives have been saving copies of webpages documenting the history of the internet other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies for example since at least the 20th century attempts have been made to preserve oral history by recording it until the 1990s this was done using analogue recording methods such as cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes with the onset of new technologies there are now digital recordings which may be recorded to cds nevertheless historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records partially because it dominates the extant historical materials and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.nnhistorical methodeditnthe historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history primary sources are first-hand evidence of history usually written but sometimes captured in other mediums made at the time of an event by a present person historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study these types of sources can provide researchers with as dalton and charnigo put it direct un-mediated information about the object of study."nhistorians use other types of sources to understand history as well secondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources these are sources which usually are accounts works or research that analyse assimilate evaluate interpret and/or synthesize primary sources tertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.nnsee
