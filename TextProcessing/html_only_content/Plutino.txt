plutino wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnthis article is about the dynamical group they are not to be confused with plutoids or plutons.nnin astronomy the plutinos are a dynamical group of trans-neptunian objects in the outermost region of the solar system that orbit in 2:3 mean-motion resonance with neptune this means that for every two orbits a plutino makes neptune orbits three times the dwarf planet pluto is the largest member and namesake of this group plutinos are named after mythological creatures associated with the underworld.nplutinos form the inner part of the kuiper belt and represent about a quarter of the known kuiper belt objects they are the largest class of the resonant trans-neptunian objects also see adjunct box with hierarchical listing aside from pluto itself the first plutino 385185 1993 ro was discovered on september 16 1993.nncontentsnnnorbitseditn some of the first known plutinos compared in size albedo and colournorigineditnit is thought that objects that are currently in mean orbital resonances with neptune initially followed independent heliocentric paths as neptune migrated outward early in the solar systems history see origins of the kuiper belt the bodies it approached would have been scattered during this process some of them would have been captured into resonances the 3:2 resonance is a low-order resonance and the strongest and most stable among all resonances this is the main reason it contains the largest number of bodies.nnorbital characteristicseditn the distribution of plutinos and relative sizes drawn 1 million times larger.nwhile the majority of plutinos have low orbital inclinations a substantial number of them follow orbits similar to that of pluto with inclinations in the 1025 range and eccentricities around 0.20.25 resulting in perihelia inside or close to the orbit of neptune and aphelia close to the main kuiper belts outer edge where objects have 1:2 resonance with neptune.nthe orbital periods of plutinos cluster around 247.3 years 1.5 neptunes orbital period varying by at most a few years from this value.nunusual plutinos include:nnnsee also the comparison with the distribution of the cubewanos.nnlong-term stabilityeditnthe gravitational influence of pluto is usually neglected given its small mass however the resonance width the range of semi-axes compatible with the resonance is very narrow and only a few times larger than plutos hill sphere gravitational influence consequently depending on the original eccentricity some plutinos will be driven out of the resonance by interactions with pluto numerical simulations suggest that the orbits of plutinos with an eccentricity 10%30 smaller or larger than that of pluto are not stable over ga timescales.nnorbital diagramseditnnbrightest objectseditnthe plutinos brighter than h6 include:nnnreferenceseditnnnnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
