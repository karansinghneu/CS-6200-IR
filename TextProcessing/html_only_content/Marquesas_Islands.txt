lying about 852 mi 1,370 km northeast of tahiti and about 3,000 mi 4,800 km away from the west coast of mexico the nearest continental land mass they fall naturally into two geographical divisions the

tahuata moho tani motane terihi fatu hiva and motu nao thomasset rock clustered around the main island of hiva oa with a combined land area of 1,049 square kilometres 405 sq mi the marquesas are among the largest island groups of french polynesia originally discovered by spanish galleons fleets en route to manila nuku hiva being the second largest island in the entire territory after tahiti with the exception of motu one all the islands of the marquesas are of volcanic origin.nin contrast to the tendency to associate polynesia with lush tropical vegetation the marquesas are remarkably dry islands though the islands lie within the tropics they are the first major break in the prevailing easterly winds that spawn from the extraordinarily dry from an atmospheric perspective humboldt current because of this the islands are subject to frequent drought conditions and only those that reach highest into the clouds generally above about 750 m 2,500 ft above sea level have reliable precipitation this has led to historical fluctuations in water supply which have played a crucial role in the sustainability of human populations in certain sections of the various islands throughout the archipelago this is especially evident in the low historical population of ua huka maximum elevation 857 m m 2,812 ft and the intermittent inhabitability of eiao maximum elevation 576 m m 1,890 ft the marquesas islands are thought to have formed by a center of upwelling magma called the marquesas hotspot.nnislands of the marquesaseditnnorthern marquesaseditn hakaui waterfall on nuku hiva

comprising two small sand banks awash on a coral reef unlike the majority of french polynesian islands the marquesas are not surrounded by protective fringing reefs except for motu one and in bays and other protected areas the only other coral in the marquesas is found in a rather strange place on the top of the island of fatu huku the south equatorial current lashes the islands mercilessly which has led to sea-caves dotting the islands shores except for where the valleys empty into the small bays the islands are remarkable for their mountain ridges which end abruptly as cliffs where they meet
