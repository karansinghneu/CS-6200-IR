was first described by chemist irving langmuir in the 1920s plasma can be artificially generated by heating or subjecting a neutral gas to a strong electromagnetic field to the point where an ionized gaseous substance becomes increasingly electrically conductive and long-range electromagnetic fields dominate the behaviour of the matter.nplasma and ionized gases have properties and display behaviours unlike those of the other states and the transition between them is mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density partially ionized or fully ionized forms of plasma may be produced neon signs and lightning are examples of partially ionized plasma the earths ionosphere is a plasma and the magnetosphere contains plasma in the earths surrounding space environment the interior of the sun is an example of fully ionized plasma along with the solar corona and stars.npositive charges in ions are achieved by stripping away electrons orbiting the atomic nuclei where the total number of electrons removed is related to either increasing temperature or the local density of other ionized matter this also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behaviour of shared ions in metals the response of plasma to electromagnetic fields is used in many modern technological devices such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.nplasma may be the most abundant form of ordinary matter in the universe although this hypothesis is currently tentative based on the existence and unknown properties of dark matter plasma is mostly associated with stars extending to the rarefied intracluster medium and possibly the intergalactic regions.nncontentsnnnhistorynthe word plasma comes from ancient greek meaning moldable substance or jelly and describes the behaviour of the ionized atomic nuclei and the electrons within the surrounding region of the plasma very simply each of these nuclei are suspended in a movable sea of electrons plasma was first identified in a crookes tube and so described by sir william crookes in 1879 he called it radiant matter the nature of this cathode ray matter was subsequently identified by british physicist sir j.j thomson in 1897.nthe term plasma was coined by irving langmuir in 1928 lewi tonks and harold mott-smith both of whom worked with irving langmuir in the 1920s recall that langmuir first used the word plasma in analogy with blood mott-smith recalls in particular that the transport of electrons from thermionic filaments reminded langmuir of the way blood plasma carries red and white corpuscles and germs."nlangmuir described the plasma he observed as follows:nnnnproperties and parametersn artists rendition of the earths plasma fountain showing oxygen helium and hydrogen ions that gush into space from regions near the earths poles the faint yellow area shown above the north pole represents gas lost from earth into space the green area is the aurora borealis where plasma energy pours back into the atmosphere.ndefinitionnplasma is a state of matter in which an ionized gaseous substance becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behaviour of the matter the plasma state can be contrasted with the other states solid liquid and gas.nplasma is an electrically neutral medium of unbound positive and negative particles i.e the overall charge of a plasma is roughly zero although these particles are unbound they are not free in the sense of not experiencing forces moving charged particles generate an electric current within a magnetic field and any movement of a charged plasma particle affects and is affected by the fields created by the other charges in turn this governs collective behaviour with many degrees of variation three factors define a plasma:nnntemperaturenplasma temperature is commonly measured in kelvin or electronvolts and is informally a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle high temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionisation which is a defining feature of a plasma the degree of plasma ionisation is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy and more weakly by the density in a relationship called the saha equation at low temperatures ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound statesatomsand the plasma will eventually become a gas.nin most cases the electrons are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined this is true even when there is a significant deviation from a maxwellian energy distribution function for example due to uv radiation energetic particles or strong electric fields because of the large difference in mass the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms for this reason the ion temperature may be very different from usually lower than the electron temperature this is especially common in weakly ionized technological plasmas where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.nnfully vs partially weakly ionized gasesnmain article degree of ionizationnsee also spitzer resistivitynfor plasma to exist ionisation is necessary the term plasma density by itself usually refers to the electron density that is the number of free electrons per unit volume the degree of ionisation of a plasma is the proportion of atoms that have lost or gained electrons and is controlled by the electron and ion temperatures and electron-ion vs electron-neutral collision frequencies the degree of ionisation is defined as where is the number density of ions and is the number density of neutral atoms the electron density is related to this by the average charge state of the ions through where is the number density of electrons.nin a plasma the electron-ion collision frequency is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency therefore with a weak degree of ionization the electron-ion collision frequency can equal the electron-neutral collision frequency is the limit separating a plasma from being partially or fully ionized.nnnmost of technological engineered plasmas are weakly ionized gases.nnthermal vs nonthermal cold plasmasnmain article nonthermal plasmansee also anisothermal plasmanbased on the relative temperatures of the electrons ions and neutrals plasmas are classified as thermal or non-thermal also referred to as cold plasmas".nnna particular and unusual case of inverse nonthermal plasma is the very high temperature plasma produced by the z machine where ions are much hotter than electrons.nnplasma potentialn lightning as an example of plasma present at earths surface typically lightning discharges 30 kiloamperes at up to 100 megavolts and emits radio waves light x and even gamma rays plasma temperatures can approach 30000 k and electron densities may exceed 10 m.nsince plasmas are very good electrical conductors electric potentials play an important role the average potential in the space between charged particles independent of how it can be measured is called the plasma potential or the space potential if an electrode is inserted into a plasma its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a debye sheath the good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small this results in the important concept of quasineutrality which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma but on the scale of the debye length there can be charge imbalance in the special case that double layers are formed the charge separation can extend some tens of debye lengths.nthe magnitude of the potentials and electric fields must be determined by means other than simply finding the net charge density a common example is to assume that the electrons satisfy the boltzmann relation:nnndifferentiating this relation provides a means to calculate the electric field from the density:nnnit is possible to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral an electron beam for example has only negative charges the density of a non-neutral plasma must generally be very low or it must be very small otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive electrostatic force.nin astrophysical plasmas debye screening prevents electric fields from directly affecting the plasma over large distances i.e greater than the debye length however the existence of charged particles causes the plasma to generate and be affected by magnetic fields this can and does cause extremely complex behaviour such as the generation of plasma double layers an object that separates charge over a few tens of debye lengths the dynamics of plasmas interacting with external and self-generated magnetic fields are studied in the academic discipline of magnetohydrodynamics.nnmagnetizationnplasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized a common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision i.e where is the electron gyrofrequency and is the electron collision rate it is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not magnetized plasmas are anisotropic meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it while electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by where is the electric field is the velocity and is the magnetic field and is not affected by debye shielding.nncomparison of plasma and gas phasesnplasma is often called the fourth state of matter after solid liquids and gases despite plasma typically being an ionized gas it is distinct from these and other lower-energy states of matter although it is closely related to the gas phase in that it also has no definite form or volume it differs in a number of ways including the following:nnnplasmas in space science and astronomynfurther information astrophysical plasma interstellar medium and intergalactic spacensee also magnetohydrodynamicsnplasmas are by far the most common phase of ordinary matter in the universe both by mass and by volume.nabove the earths surface the ionosphere is a plasma and the magnetosphere contains plasma within our solar system interplanetary space is filled with the plasma expelled via the solar wind extending from the suns surface out to the heliopause furthermore all the distant stars and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma albeit at very low densities astrophysical plasmas are also observed in accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs neutron stars or black holes in close binary star systems plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like m87s jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.nncommon plasmasnplasmas can appear in nature in various forms and locations which can be usefully broadly summarised in the following table:nnnncomplex plasma phenomenanalthough the underlying equations governing plasmas are relatively simple plasma behaviour is extraordinarily varied and subtle the emergence of unexpected behaviour from a simple model is a typical feature of a complex system such systems lie in some sense on the boundary between ordered and disordered behaviour and cannot typically be described either by simple smooth mathematical functions or by pure randomness the spontaneous formation of interesting spatial features on a wide range of length scales is one manifestation of plasma complexity the features are interesting for example because they are very sharp spatially intermittent the distance between features is much larger than the features themselves or have a fractal form many of these features were first studied in the laboratory and have subsequently been recognized throughout the universe examples of complexity and complex structures in plasmas include:nnfilamentationnstriations or string-like structures also known as birkeland currents are seen in many plasmas like the plasma ball the aurora lightning electric arcs solar flares and supernova remnants they are sometimes associated with larger current densities and the interaction with the magnetic field can form a magnetic rope structure high power microwave breakdown at atmospheric pressure also leads to the formation of filamentary structures see also plasma pinchnfilamentation also refers to the self-focusing of a high power laser pulse at high powers the nonlinear part of the index of refraction becomes important and causes a higher index of refraction in the center of the laser beam where the laser is brighter than at the edges causing a feedback that focuses the laser even more the tighter focused laser has a higher peak brightness irradiance that forms a plasma the plasma has an index of refraction lower than one and causes a defocusing of the laser beam the interplay of the focusing index of refraction and the defocusing plasma makes the formation of a long filament of plasma that can be micrometers to kilometers in length one interesting aspect of the filamentation generated plasma is the relatively low ion density due to defocusing effects of the ionized electrons see also filament propagationnnnon-neutral plasmanthe strength and range of the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities of positive and negative charges in any sizeable region are equal quasineutrality a plasma with a significant excess of charge density or in the extreme case is composed of a single species is called a non-neutral plasma in such a plasma electric fields play a dominant role examples are charged particle beams an electron cloud in a penning trap and positron plasmas.nndusty plasma/grain plasmana dusty plasma contains tiny charged particles of dust typically found in space the dust particles acquire high charges and interact with each other a plasma that contains larger particles is called grain plasma under laboratory conditions dusty plasmas are also called complex plasmas.nnimpermeable plasmanimpermeable plasma is a type of thermal plasma which acts like an impermeable solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by hannes alfvn in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls however later it was found that the external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.nin 2013 a group of materials scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable impermeable plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas while spectroscopic data on the characteristics of plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement they also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating known as viscous heating leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.nnmathematical descriptionsn the complex self-constricting magnetic field lines and current paths in a field-aligned birkeland current that can develop in a plasma.nmain article plasma modelingnto completely describe the state of a plasma all of thenparticle locations and velocities that describe the electromagnetic field in the plasma region would need to be written down.nhowever it is generally not practical or necessary to keep track of all the particles in a plasma.ntherefore plasma physicists commonly use less detailed descriptions of whichnthere are two main types:nnfluid modelnfluid models describe plasmas in terms of smoothed quantities like density and averaged velocity around each position see plasma parameters one simple fluid model magnetohydrodynamics treats the plasma as a single fluid governed by a combination of maxwells equations and the navierstokes equations a more general description is the two-fluid plasma picture where the ions and electrons are described separately fluid models are often accurate when collisionality is sufficiently high to keep the plasma velocity distribution close to a maxwellboltzmann distribution because fluid models usually describe the plasma in terms of a single flow at a certain temperature at each spatial location they can neither capture velocity space structures like beams or double layers nor resolve wave-particle effects.nnkinetic modelnkinetic models describe the particle velocity distribution function at each point in the plasma and therefore do not need to assume a maxwellboltzmann distribution a kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas there are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma one is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position the other known as the particle-in-cell pic technique includes kinetic information by following the trajectories of a large number of individual particles kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models the vlasov equation may be used to describe the dynamics of a system of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.nin magnetized plasmas a gyrokinetic approach can substantially reduce the computational expense of a fully kinetic simulation.nnartificial plasmasnmost artificial plasmas are generated by the application of electric and/or magnetic fields through a gas plasma generated in a laboratory setting and for industrial use can be generally categorized by:nnngeneration of artificial plasman n artificial plasma produced in air by a jacobs laddernjust like the many uses of plasma there are several means for its generation however one principle is common to all of them there must be energy input to produce and sustain it for this case plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid an electrically non-conducting material as can be seen in the adjacent image which shows a discharge tube as a simple example dc used for simplicity.nthe potential difference and subsequent electric field pull the bound electrons negative toward the anode positive electrode while the cathode negative electrode pulls the nucleus as the voltage increases the current stresses the material by electric polarization beyond its dielectric limit termed strength into a stage of electrical breakdown marked by an electric spark where the material transforms from being an insulator into a conductor as it becomes increasingly ionized the underlying process is the townsend avalanche where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons as can be seen in the figure on the right the first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons therefore the number of charged particles increases rapidly in the millions only after about 20 successive sets of collisions mainly due to a small mean free path average distance travelled between collisions.nnelectric arcn cascade process of ionisation electrons are e neutral atoms o and cations n avalanche effect between two electrodes the original ionisation event liberates one electron and each subsequent collision liberates a further electron so two electrons emerge from each collision the ionising electron and the liberated electron.nwith ample current density and ionisation this forms a luminous electric arc a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning between the electrodes electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat which dissociates more gas molecules and ionises the resulting atoms where degree of ionisation is determined by temperature and as per the sequence solid-liquid-gas-plasma the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma a thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium which is to say that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles i.e atoms molecules and ions and electrons this is so because when thermal plasmas are generated electrical energy is given to electrons which due to their great mobility and large numbers are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision without energy loss to the heavy particles.nnexamples of industrial/commercial plasmanbecause of their sizable temperature and density ranges plasmas find applications in many fields of research technology and industry for example in industrial and extractive metallurgy surface treatments such as plasma spraying coating etching in microelectronics metal cutting and welding as well as in everyday vehicle exhaust cleanup and fluorescent/luminescent lamps fuel ignition while even playing a part in supersonic combustion engines for aerospace engineering.nnlow-pressure dischargesnnatmospheric pressurennmhd convertersnmain articles magnetohydrodynamic converter magnetohydrodynamic generator and magnetohydrodynamic drivensee also electrothermal instabilityna world effort was triggered in the 1960s to study magnetohydrodynamic converters in order to bring mhd power conversion to market with commercial power plants of a new kind converting the kinetic energy of a high velocity plasma into electricity with no moving parts at a high efficiency research was also conducted in the field of supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics to study plasma interaction with magnetic fields to eventually achieve passive and even active flow control around vehicles or projectiles in order to soften and mitigate shock waves lower thermal transfer and reduce drag.nsuch ionized gases used in plasma technology technological or engineered plasmas are usually weakly ionized gases in the sense that only a tiny fraction of the gas molecules are ionized these kinds of weakly ionized gases are also nonthermal cold plasmas in the presence of magnetics fields the study of such magnetized nonthermal weakly ionized gases involves resistive magnetohydrodynamics with low magnetic reynolds number a challenging field of plasma physics where calculations require dyadic tensors in a 7-dimensional phase space when used in combination with a high hall parameter a critical value triggers the problematic electrothermal instability which limited these technological developments.nnresearchnplasmas are the object of study of the academic field of plasma science or plasma physics including sub-disciplines
