vostok 1 wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnnnvostok 1 russian east or orient 1 was the first spaceflight of the vostok programme and the first manned spaceflight in history the vostok 3ka space capsule was launched from baikonur cosmodrome on april 12 1961 with soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin aboard making him the first human to cross into outer space.nthe orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at 169 kilometers 91 nautical miles at its lowest point the flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at 7 km 23,000 ft altitude.nncontentsnnnbackgroundeditnmain article vostok programmenthe space race between the soviet union and the united states the two cold war superpowers began just before the soviet union launched the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 in 1957 both countries wanted to develop spaceflight technology quickly particularly by launching the first successful human spaceflight the soviet union secretly pursued the vostok programme in competition with the united states project mercury vostok launched several precursor unmanned missions between may 1960 and march 1961 to test and develop the vostok rocket family and space capsule these missions had varied degrees of success but the final twokorabl-sputnik 4 and korabl-sputnik 5were complete successes allowing the first manned flight.nncreweditnnthe vostok 1 capsule was designed to carry a single cosmonaut yuri gagarin 27 was chosen as the prime pilot of vostok 1 with gherman titov and grigori nelyubov as backups these assignments were formally made on april 8 four days before the mission but gagarin had been a favourite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months.nthe final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of the head of cosmonaut training nikolai kamanin in an april 5 diary entry kamanin wrote that he was still undecided between gagarin and titov the only thing that keeps me from picking titov is the need to have the stronger person for the one day flight kamanin was referring to the second mission vostok 2 compared to the relatively short single-orbit mission of vostok 1 when gagarin and titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on april 9 gagarin was very happy and titov was disappointed on april 10 this meeting was reenacted in front of television cameras so there would be official footage of the event this included an acceptance speech by gagarin as an indication of the level of secrecy involved one of the other cosmonaut candidates alexei leonov later recalled that he did not know who was chosen for the mission until after the spaceflight had begun.nnmedical exameditngagarin was examined by a team of doctors prior to his flight one doctor gave her recollection of the events in an interview with russia today in april 2011 gagarin looked more pale than usual he was unsociable and quiet which was not like him at all he would answer by nodding or a short yes to all questions sometimes he would start humming some tunes this was a different gagarin we geared him up and hugged and i said yuri everything will be fine and he nodded back."nnpreparationseditn model of the vostok spacecraft with its upper stage on display in frankfurt airports russia in space exhibitionnunlike later vostok missions there were no dedicated tracking ships available to receive signals from the spacecraft instead they relied on the network of ground stations also called command points to communicate with the spacecraft all of these command points were located within the soviet union.nbecause of weight constraints there was no backup retrorocket engine the spacecraft carried 10 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural orbital decay in the event the retrorockets failed.nthe letters cccp were hand-painted onto gagarins helmet by engineer gherman lebedev during transfer to the launch site as it had been less than a year since u2 pilot gary powers was shot down lebedev reasoned that without some country identification there was a small chance the cosmonaut might be mistaken for a spy on landing.nnautomatic controleditn part of the vostok 1 instrument panel prominently displaying the globus navigation instrumentnthe entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by ground control this was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness and therefore it was decided to lock the pilots manual controls in an unusual move a code to unlock the controls was placed in an onboard envelope for gagarins use in case of emergency prior to the flight kamanin and others told gagarin the code anyway.nnapril 11 1961editn electrocardiogram of gagarin recorded april 11 1961 at 19 hours and 35 minutes exhibited at the memorial museum of cosmonautics in moscow.nat baikonur cosmodrome on the morning of april 11 1961 the vostok-k rocket together with the attached vostok 3ka space capsule were transported several kilometers to the launch pad in a horizontal position once they arrived at the launch pad a quick examination of the booster was conducted by technicians to make sure everything was in order when no visible problems were found the booster was erected on lc-1 at 10:00 moscow time gagarin and titov were given a final review of the flight plan they were informed that launch was scheduled to occur the following day at 09:07 moscow time this time was chosen so that when the capsule started to fly over africa which was when the retrorockets would need to fire for reentry the solar illumination would be ideal for the orientation systems sensors.nat 18:00 once various physiological readings had been taken the doctors instructed the cosmonauts not to discuss the upcoming missions that evening gagarin and titov relaxed by listening to music playing pool and chatting about their childhoods at 21:50 both men were offered sleeping pills to ensure a good nights sleep but they both declined physicians had attached sensors to the cosmonauts to monitor their condition throughout the night and they believed that both had slept well gagarins biographers doran and bizony say that neither gagarin nor titov slept that night chief designer sergei korolev didnt sleep that night due to anxiety caused by the imminent spaceflight.nnmissioneditnat 05:30 moscow time on the morning of april 12 1961 both gagarin and his backup titov were woken they were given breakfast assisted into their spacesuits and then were transported to the launch pad gagarin entered the vostok 1 spacecraft and at 07:10 local time 04:10 utc the radio communication system was turned on once gagarin was in the spacecraft his picture appeared on television screens in the launch control room from an onboard camera launch would not occur for another two hours and during the time gagarin chatted with the missions main capcom as well as chief designer sergei korolev nikolai kamanin and a few others following a series of tests and checks about forty minutes after gagarin entered the spacecraft its hatch was closed gagarin however reported that the hatch was not sealed properly and technicians spent nearly an hour removing all the screws and sealing the hatch again according to a 2014 obituary vostoks chief designer oleg ivanovsky personally helped rebolt the hatch there is some disagreement over whether the hatch was in fact not sealed correctly as a more recent account stated the indication was false.nduring this time gagarin requested some music to be played over the radio korolev was reportedly suffering from chest pains and worried as up to this point the soviet space launch rate was 50 12 out of 24 launches had failed two vostoks had failed to reach orbit due to launch vehicle malfunctions and another two malfunctioned in orbit korolev was given a pill to calm him down gagarin on the other hand was described as calm about half an hour before launch his pulse was recorded at 64 beats per minute.nnlauncheditn launch of vostok 1nnntime in orbiteditn ground trace of gagarins complete orbit the landing point is west of the takeoff point because of the earths eastward rotation.nnthe

orientation for the retrorocket firing and shortly afterwards the liquid-fueled engine fired for about 42 seconds over the west coast of africa near angola about 8,000 kilometers 4,300 nautical miles uprange of the landing point the orbits perigee and apogee had been selected to cause reentry due to orbital decay within 10 days the limit of the life support system function in the event of retrorocket malfunction however the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days.nten seconds after retrofire commands were sent to separate the vostok service module from the reentry module code name little ball russian translit sharik but the equipment module unexpectedly remained attached to the reentry module by a bundle of wires at around 07:35 ut the two parts of the spacecraft began reentry and went through strong gyrations as vostok 1 neared egypt at this point the wires broke the two modules separated and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude gagarin telegraphed everything is ok despite continuing gyrations he later reported that he did not want to make noise as he had correctly reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module as gagarin continued his descent he remained conscious as he experienced about 8 g during reentry gagarins own report states over 10 g".nat 07:55 ut when vostok 1 was still 7 km from the ground the hatch of the spacecraft was released and two seconds later gagarin was ejected at 2.5 km 8,200 ft altitude the main parachute was deployed from the vostok spacecraft two schoolgirls witnessed the vostok landing and described the scene it was a huge ball about two or three meters high it fell then it bounced and then it fell again there was a huge hole where it hit the first time."ngagarins parachute opened almost right away and about ten minutes later at 08:05 ut gagarin landed both he and the

in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as i walked they started to back away in fear i told them dont be afraid i am a soviet citizen like you who has descended from space and i must find a telephone to call moscow!"nnreactions and legacyeditnsoviet reactioneditngagarins flight was announced while gagarin was still in orbit by yuri levitan the leading soviet radio personality since the 30s although normally news of soviet rocket launches would only be aired after the fact sergei korolev wrote a note to the party central committee to convince them that the announcement should be made as early as possible:nnnwe consider it advisable to publish the first tass report immediately after the satellite-spacecraft enters orbit for the following reasons:na if a rescue becomes necessary it will facilitate rapid organization of a rescue;nb it precludes any foreign government declaring that the cosmonaut is a military scout.nnnthe flight was celebrated as a great triumph of soviet science and technology demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism moscow and other cities in the ussr held mass demonstrations the scale of which was comparable to world war ii victory parades gagarin was awarded the title of hero of the soviet union the nations highest honour he also became an international celebrity receiving numerous honours and awards.napril 12 was declared cosmonautics day in the ussr and is celebrated today in russia as one of the official commemorative dates of russia in 2011 it was declared the international day of human space flight by the united nations.ngagarins informal reply poyekhali lets roll became a historical phrase used to refer to the arrival of the space age in human history later it was included in the refrain of a soviet patriotic song written by alexandra pakhmutova and nikolai dobronravov he said lets roll he waved his hand.nthe soviet press later reported that minutes before boarding the spacecraft gagarin made a speech dear friends you who are close to me and you whom i do not know fellow russians and people of all countries and all continents in a few minutes a powerful space vehicle will carry me into the distant realm of space what can i tell you in these last minutes before the launch my whole life appears to me as one beautiful moment all that i previously lived through and did was lived through and done for the sake of this moment according to historian asif siddiqi gagarin actually was essentially forced to utter a stream of banalities prepared by anonymous speechwriters taped much earlier in moscow.nnamerican reactioneditnofficially the u.s congratulated the soviet union on its accomplishments writing for the new york times shortly after the flight however journalist arthur krock described mixed feelings in the united states due to fears of the spaceflights potential military implications for the cold war and the detroit free press wrote that the people of washington london paris and all points between might have been dancing in the streets if it were not for doubts and suspicions about soviet intentions other us writers reported worries that the spaceflight had won a propaganda victory on behalf of communism president john f kennedy was quoted as saying that it would be some time before the us could match the soviet launch vehicle technology and that the news will be worse before its better kennedy also sent congratulations to the soviet union for their outstanding technical achievement opinion pages of many us newspapers urged renewed efforts to overtake the soviet scientific accomplishments.nadlai stevenson then the us ambassador to the united nations was quoted as saying now that the soviet scientists have put a man into space and brought him back alive i hope they will also help to bring the united nations back alive and on a more serious note urged international agreements covering the use of space which did not occur until the outer space treaty of 1967.nnother world reactionseditnprime minister jawaharlal nehru of india praised the soviet union for a great victory of man over the forces of nature and urged that it be considered as a victory for peace the economist voiced worries that orbital platforms might be used for surprise nuclear attacks the svenska dagbladet in sweden chided free countries for splitting up and frittering away their resources while west germanys die welt argued that america had the resources to have sent a man into space first but was beaten by soviet purposefulness japans yomiuri shimbun urged that both the united states and the soviet union should use their new knowledge and techniques for the good of mankind and egypts akhbar el yom likewise expressed hopes that the cold war would turn into a peaceful race in infinite space and turn away from armed conflicts such as the laotian civil war.nnworld recordeditnthe fai rules in 1961 required that a pilot must land with the spacecraft to be considered an official spaceflight for the fai record books although some contemporary soviet sources stated that gagarin had parachuted separately to the ground the soviet union officially insisted that he had landed with the vostok the government forced the cosmonaut to lie in press conferences and the fai certified the flight the soviet union did not admit until 1971 that gagarin had ejected and landed separately from the vostok descent module.nwhen soviet officials filled out the fai papers to register the flight of vostok 1 they stated that the launch site was baykonur at 472200n 652900e 47.36667n 65.48333e 47.36667 65.48333 in reality the launch site was near tyuratam at 455512.72n 632032.32e 45.9202000n 63.3423111e 45.9202000 63.3423111 250 km 160 mi to

vostok-1 landing site near engels russianfour decades after the flight historian asif azam siddiqi wrote that vostok 1nnwill undoubtedly remain one of the major milestones in not only the history of space exploration but also the history of the human race itself the fact that this accomplishment was successfully carried out by the soviet union a country completely devastated by war just sixteen years prior makes the achievement even more impressive unlike the united states the ussr had to begin from a position of tremendous disadvantage its industrial infrastructure had been ruined and its technological capabilities were outdated at best a good portion of its land had been devastated by war and it had lost about 25 million citizens but it was the totalitarian state that overwhelmingly took the lead in the space race.nnthe landing site is now a monument park the central feature in the park is a 25 meter tall monument that consists of a silver metallic rocketship rising on a curved metallic column of flame from a wedge shaped white stone base in front of this is a 3 meter tall white stone statue of yuri gagarin wearing a spacesuit with one arm raised in greeting and the other holding a space helmet.nas of september 2018 the vostok 1 re-entry capsule belongs to the s p korolev rsc energia museum in korolev city however during the summer of 2018 it is on a temporary loan to the space pavilion at the vdnkh in moscow.nin 2011 documentary film maker christopher riley partnered with european space agency astronaut paolo nespoli to record a new film of what gagarin would have seen of the earth from his spaceship by matching historical audio recordings to video from the international space station following the ground path taken by vostok 1 the resulting film first orbit was released online to celebrate the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight.nnsee alsoeditnnnnnoteseditnnnreferenceseditnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
