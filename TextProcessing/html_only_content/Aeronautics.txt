aircraft.naeronautics is the science or art involved with the study design and manufacturing of air flight capable machines and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere the british royal aeronautical society identifies the aspects of aeronautical art science and engineering and the profession of aeronautics which expression includes astronautics nwhile the term originally referred solely to operating the aircraft it has since been expanded to include technology business and other aspects related to aircraft nthe term aviation is sometimes used interchangeably with aeronautics although aeronautics includes lighter-than-air craft such as airships and includes ballistic vehicles while aviation technically does not.na significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of dynamics called aerodynamics which deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion such as an aircraft.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnearly ideaseditn designs for flying machines by leonardo da vinci circa 1490nattempts to fly without any real aeronautical understanding have been made from the earliest times typically by constructing wings and jumping from a tower with crippling or lethal results.nwiser investigators sought to gain some rational understanding through the study of bird flight an early example appears in ancient egyptian texts later medieval islamic scientists also made such studies the founders of modern aeronautics leonardo da vinci in the renaissance and cayley in 1799 both began their investigations with studies of bird flight.nman-carrying kites are believed to have been used extensively in ancient china in 1282 the european explorer marco polo described the chinese techniques then current the chinese also constructed small hot air balloons or lanterns and rotary-wing toys.nan early european to provide any scientific discussion of flight was roger bacon who described principles of operation for the lighter-than-air balloon and the flapping-wing ornithopter which he envisaged would be constructed in the future the lifting medium for his balloon would be an aether whose composition he did not know.nin the late fifteenth century leonardo da vinci followed up his study of birds with designs for some of the earliest flying machines including the flapping-wing ornithopter and the rotating-wing helicopter although his designs were rational they were not based on particularly good science many of his designs such as a four-person screw-type helicopter have severe flaws he did at least understand that an object offers as much resistance to the air as the air does to the object newton would not publish the third law of motion until 1687 his analysis led to the realisation that manpower alone was not sufficient for sustained flight and his later designs included a mechanical power source such as a spring da vincis work was lost after his death and did not reappear until it had been overtaken by the work of george cayley.nnballoon flighteditnmain article history of ballooningn francesco lana de terzis flying boat concept c.1670nthe modern era of lighter-than-air flight began early in the 17th century with galileos experiments in which he showed that air has weight around 1650 cyrano de bergerac wrote some fantasy novels in which he described the principle of ascent using a substance dew he supposed to be lighter than air and descending by releasing a controlled amount of the substance francesco lana de terzi measured the pressure of air at sea level and in 1670 proposed the first scientifically credible lifting medium in the form of hollow metal spheres from which all the air had been pumped out these would be lighter than the displaced air and able to lift an airship his proposed methods of controlling height are still in use today by carrying ballast which may be dropped overboard to gain height and by venting the lifting containers to lose height in practice de terzis spheres would have collapsed under air pressure and further developments had to wait for more practicable lifting gases.nn montgolfier brothers flight 1784nfrom the mid-18th century the montgolfier brothers in france began experimenting with balloons their balloons were made of paper and early experiments using steam as the lifting gas were short-lived due to its effect on the paper as it condensed mistaking smoke for a kind of steam they began filling their balloons with hot smoky air which they called electric smoke and despite not fully understanding the principles at work made some successful launches and in 1783 were invited to give a demonstration to the french acadmie des sciences.nmeanwhile the discovery of hydrogen led joseph black in c 1780 to propose its use as a lifting gas though practical demonstration awaited a gas tight balloon material on hearing of the montgolfier brothers invitation the french academy member jacques charles offered a similar demonstration of a hydrogen balloon charles and two craftsmen the robert brothers developed a gas tight material of rubberised silk for the envelope the hydrogen gas was to be generated by chemical reaction during the filling process.nthe montgolfier designs had several shortcomings not least the need for dry weather and a tendency for sparks from the fire to set light to the paper balloon the manned design had a gallery around the base of the balloon rather than the hanging basket of the first unmanned design which brought the paper closer to the fire on their free flight de rozier and darlandes took buckets of water and sponges to douse these fires as they arose on the other hand the manned design of charles was essentially modern as a result of these exploits the hot-air balloon became known as the montgolfire type and the hydrogen balloon the charlire.ncharles and the robert brothers next balloon la caroline was a charlire that followed jean baptiste meusniers proposals for an elongated dirigible balloon and was notable for having an outer envelope with the gas contained in a second inner ballonet on 19 september 1784 it completed the first flight of over 100 km between paris and beuvry despite the man-powered propulsive devices proving useless.nin an attempt the next year to provide both endurance and controllability de rozier developed a balloon having both hot air and hydrogen gas bags a design which was soon named after him as the rozire the principle was to use the hydrogen section for constant lift and to navigate vertically by heating and allowing to cool the hot air section in order to catch the most favourable wind at whatever altitude it was blowing the balloon envelope was made of goldbeaters skin the first flight ended in disaster and the approach has seldom been used since.nncayley and the foundation of modern aeronauticseditnsir george cayley 1773-1857 is widely acknowledged as the founder of modern aeronautics he was first called the father of the aeroplane in 1846 and henson called him the father of aerial navigation he was the first true scientific aerial investigator to publish his work which included for the first time the underlying principles and forces of flight.nin 1809 he began the publication of a landmark three-part treatise titled on aerial navigation 18091810 in it he wrote the first scientific statement of the problem the whole problem is confined within these limits viz to make a surface support a given weight by the application of power to the resistance of air he identified the four vector forces that influence an aircraft thrust lift drag and weight and distinguished stability and control in his designs.nhe developed the modern conventional form of the fixed-wing aeroplane having a stabilising tail with both horizontal and vertical surfaces flying gliders both unmanned and manned.nhe introduced the use of the whirling arm test rig to investigate the aerodynamics of flight using it to discover the benefits of the curved or cambered aerofoil over the flat wing he had used for his first glider he also identified and described the importance of dihedral diagonal bracing and drag reduction and contributed to the understanding and design of ornithopters and parachutes.nanother significant invention was the tension-spoked wheel which he devised in order to create a light strong wheel for aircraft undercarriage.nnthe 19th centuryeditnduring the 19th century cayleys ideas were refined proved and expanded on important investigators included otto lilienthal and horatio phillips.nnthe 20th centuryeditnpedro paulet scientist born in the city of arequipa peru in the year of 1874 was one of the first to experiment with propulsion rockets being considered the father of modern rocket and by others as the father of aeronautics modern he developed plans for a torpedo plane which is why he is considered ahead of his time when the internal explosion engines were invented small enough to be able to propel a flying device with them a race started between two flight possibilities the lighter than the air dirigibles and the heavier than the

science and aeronautical engineering.nnaviationeditnmain article aviationnaviation is the art or practice of aeronautics historically aviation meant only heavier-than-air flight but nowadays it includes flying in balloons and airships.nnaeronautical scienceeditnaeronautical science covers the practical theory of aeronautics and aviation including operations navigation air safety and human factors.na candidate pilot is likely to study for a qualification in aeronautical science.nnaeronautical engineeringeditnmain article aerospace engineeringnaeronautical engineering covers the design and construction of aircraft including how they are powered how they are used and how they are controlled for safe operation.na major part of aeronautical engineering is aerodynamics the science of passing through the air.nwith the increasing activity in space flight nowadays aeronautics and astronautics are often combined as aerospace engineering.nnaerodynamicseditnmain article aerodynamicsnthe science of aerodynamics deals with the motion of air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion such as an aircraft.nthe study of aerodynamics falls broadly into three areas:nincompressible flow occurs where the air simply moves to avoid objects typically at subsonic speeds below that of sound mach 1.ncompressible flow occurs where shock waves appear at points where the air becomes compressed typically at speeds above mach 1.ntransonic flow occurs in the intermediate speed range around mach 1 where the airflow over an object may be locally subsonic at one point and locally supersonic at another.nnrocketryeditnsee also rocketnplay media launch of apollo 15 saturn v rocket t 30 s through t 40 s.na rocket or rocket vehicle is a missile spacecraft aircraft or other vehicle which obtains thrust from a rocket engine in all rockets the exhaust is formed entirely from propellants carried within the rocket before use rocket engines work by action and reaction rocket engines push rockets forwards simply by throwing their exhaust backwards extremely fast.nrockets for military and recreational uses date back to at least 13th-century china significant scientific interplanetary and industrial use did not occur until the 20th century when rocketry was the enabling technology of the space age including setting foot on the moon.nrockets are used for fireworks weaponry ejection seats launch vehicles for artificial satellites human spaceflight and exploration of other planets while comparatively inefficient for low speed use they are very lightweight and powerful capable of generating large accelerations and of attaining extremely high speeds with reasonable efficiency.nchemical rockets are the most common type of rocket and they typically create their exhaust by the combustion of rocket propellant chemical rockets store a large amount of energy in an easily released form and can be very dangerous however careful design testing construction and use minimizes risks.nnsee alsoeditnnnreferenceseditncitationseditnnnsourceseditnnnnexternal linkseditn media related to aeronautics at wikimedia commonsnnnnncourseseditnnresearcheditnnnnn
