micro-g environment wikipedia n redirected from microgravityn jump to navigationnjump to searchn the international space station in orbit around earth february 2010 the iss is in a micro-g environment.nthe term micro-g environment also g often referred to by the term microgravity is more or less a synonym for weightlessness and zero-g but indicates that g-forces are not quite zerojust very small the symbol for microgravity g was used on the insignias of space shuttle flights sts-87 and sts-107 because these flights were devoted to microgravity research in low earth orbit.nncontentsnnnabsence of gravityeditna stationary micro-g environment would require travelling far enough into deep space so as to reduce the effect of gravity by attenuation to almost zero this is the simplest in conception but requires traveling an enormous distance rendering it most impractical for example to reduce the gravity of the earth by a factor of one million one needs to be at a distance of 6 million kilometers from the earth but to reduce the gravity of the sun to this amount one has to be at a distance of 3.7 billion kilometers on earth the gravity due to the rest of the milky way is already attenuated by a factor greater than one million so we do not need to move away further from its center thus it is not impossible but it has only been achieved so far by four interstellar probes voyager 1 and 2 of the voyager program and pioneer 10 and 11 of the pioneer program and they did not return to earth to reduce the gravity to one thousandth of that on earths surface one needs to be at a distance of 200,000 km.nnnat a distance relatively close to earth less than 3000 km gravity is only slightly reduced as an object orbits a body such as the earth gravity is still attracting objects towards the earth and the object is accelerated downward at almost 1g because the objects are typically moving laterally with respect to the surface at such immense speeds the object will not lose altitude because of the curvature of the earth when viewed from an orbiting observer other close objects in space appear to be floating because everything is being pulled towards earth at the same speed but also moving forward as the earths surface falls away below all these objects are in free fall not zero gravity.ncompare the gravitational potential at some of these locations.nnfree falleditnwhat remains is a micro-g environment moving in free fall i.e there are no forces other than gravity acting on the people or objects in this environment to prevent air drag making the free fall less perfect objects and people can free-fall in a capsule that itself while not necessarily in free fall is accelerated as in free fall this can be done by applying a force to compensate for air drag alternatively free fall can be carried out in space or in a vacuum tower or shaft.ntwo cases can be distinguished temporary micro-g where after some time the earths surface is or would be reached and indefinite micro-g.na temporary micro-g environment exists in a drop tube in a tower or shaft a sub-orbital spaceflight e.g with a sounding rocket and in an airplane such as used by nasas reduced gravity research program aka the vomit comet and by the zero gravity corporation a temporary micro-g environment is applied for training of astronauts for some experiments for filming movies and for recreational purposes.na micro-g environment for an indefinite time while also possible in a spaceship going to infinity in a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit is most practical in an earth orbit this is the environment commonly experienced in the international space station space shuttle etc while this scenario is the most suitable for scientific experimentation and commercial exploitation it is still quite expensive to operate in mostly due to launch costs.nntidal and inertial accelerationeditnobjects in orbit are not perfectly weightless due to several effects:nnncommercial applicationseditnmetal sphereseditnin a shot tower now obsolete molten metal such as lead or steel was dripped through a sieve into free fall with sufficient height several hundred feet the metal would be solid enough to resist impact usually in a water bath at the bottom of the tower while the shot may have been slightly deformed by its passage through the air and by impact at the bottom this method produced metal spheres of sufficient roundness to be used directly in shotgun shells or to be refined by further processing for applications requiring higher accuracy.nnhigh-quality crystalseditnwhile not yet a commercial application there has been interest in growing crystals in micro-g as in a space station or automated artificial satellite in an attempt to reduce crystal lattice defects such defect-free crystals may prove useful for certain microelectronic applications and also to produce crystals for subsequent x-ray crystallography.nnnhealth effects of the micro-g environmenteditnspace motion sicknesseditn six astronauts who had been in training at the johnson space center for almost a year are getting a sample of a micro-g environmentnspace motion sickness sms is thought to be a subtype of motion sickness that plagues nearly half of all astronauts who venture into space sms along with facial stuffiness from headward shifts of fluids headaches and back pain is part of a broader complex of symptoms that comprise space adaptation syndrome sas sms was first described in 1961 during the second orbit of the fourth manned spaceflight when the cosmonaut gherman titov aboard the vostok 2 described feeling disoriented with physical complaints mostly consistent with motion sickness it is one of the most studied physiological problems of spaceflight but continues to pose a significant difficulty for many astronauts in some instances it can be so debilitating that astronauts must sit out from their scheduled occupational duties in space including missing out on a spacewalk they have spent months training to perform in most cases however astronauts will work through the symptoms even with degradation in their performance.ndespite their experiences in some of the most rigorous and demanding physical maneuvers on earth even the most seasoned astronauts may be affected by sms resulting in symptoms of severe nausea projectile vomiting fatigue malaise feeling sick and headache these symptoms may occur so abruptly and without any warning that space travelers may vomit suddenly without time to contain the emesis resulting in strong odors and liquid within the cabin which may affect other astronauts symptoms typically last anywhere from one to three days upon entering weightlessness but may recur upon reentry to earths gravity or even shortly after landing sms differs from terrestrial motion sickness in that sweating and pallor are typically minimal or absent and gastrointestinal findings usually demonstrate absent bowel sounds indicating reduced gastrointestinal motility.neven when the nausea and vomiting resolve some central nervous system symptoms may persist which may degrade the astronauts performance graybiel and knepton proposed the term sopite syndrome to describe symptoms of lethargy and drowsiness associated with motion sickness in 1976 since then their definition has been revised to include a symptom complex that develops as a result of exposure to real or apparent motion and is characterized by excessive drowsiness lassitude lethargy mild depression and reduced ability to focus on an assigned task together these symptoms may pose a substantial threat albeit temporary to the astronaut who must remain attentive to life and death issues at all times.nsms is most commonly thought to be a disorder of the vestibular system that occurs when sensory information from the visual system sight and the proprioceptive system posture position of the body conflicts with misperceived information from the semicircular canals and the otoliths within the inner ear this is known as the neural mismatch theory and was first suggested in 1975 by reason and brand alternatively the fluid shift hypothesis suggests that weightlessness reduces the hydrostatic pressure on the lower body causing fluids to shift toward the head from the rest of the body these fluid shifts are thought to increase cerebrospinal fluid pressure causing back aches intracranial pressure causing headaches and inner ear fluid pressure causing vestibular dysfunction.ndespite a multitude of studies searching for a solution to the problem of sms it remains an ongoing problem for space travel most non-pharmacological countermeasures such as training and other physical maneuvers have offered minimal benefit thornton and bonato noted pre and inflight adaptive efforts some of them mandatory and most of them onerous have been for the most part operational failures to date the most common intervention is promethazine an injectable antihistamine with antiemetic properties but sedation can be a problematic side effect other common pharmacological options include metaclopromide as well as oral and transdermal application of scopolamine but drowsiness and sedation are common side effects for these medications as well.nnmusculoskeletal effectseditnin the space or microgravity environment the effects of unloading varies significantly among individuals with sex differences compounding the variability differences in mission duration and the small sample size of astronauts participating in the same mission also adds to the variability to the musculoskeletal disorders that are seen in space in addition to muscle loss microgravity leads to increased bone resorption decreased bone mineral density and increased fracture risks bone resorption leads to increased urinary levels of calcium which can subsequently lead to an increased risk of nephrolithiasis.nin the first two weeks that the muscles are unloaded from carrying the weight of the human frame during space flight whole muscle atrophy begins postural muscles contain more slow fibers and are more prone to atrophy than non-postural muscle groups the loss of muscle mass occurs because of imbalances in protein synthesis and breakdown the loss of muscle mass is also accompanied by a loss of muscle strength which was observed after only 25 days of spaceflight during the soyuz-3 and soyuz-8 missions decreases in the generation of contractile forces and whole muscle power have also been found in response to microgravity.nto counter the effects of microgravity on the musculoskeletal system aerobic exercise is recommended this often takes the form of in-flight cycling a more effective regimen includes resistive exercises or the use of a penguin suit contains sewn-in elastic bands to maintain a stretch load on antigravity muscles centrifugation and vibration centrifugation recreates earths gravitational force on the space station in order to prevent muscle atrophy centrifugation can be performed with centrifuges or by cycling along the inner wall of the space station whole body vibration has been found to reduce bone resorption through mechanisms that are unclear vibration can be delivered using exercise devices that use vertical displacements juxtaposed to a fulcrum or by using a plate that oscillates on a vertical axis the use of beta-2 adrenergic agonists to increase muscle mass and the use of essential amino acids in conjunction with resistive exercises have been proposed as pharmacologic means of combating muscle atrophy in space.nmicrogravity can also lead to height increases in 2018 a japanese astronout reported growing 2 centimetres in just three weeks of micro-gravity on board the international space station.nncardiovascular effectseditnplay media astronaut tracy dyson talks about studies into cardiovascular health aboard the international space station.nnext to the skeletal and muscular system the cardiovascular system is less strained in weightlessness than on earth and is de-conditioned during longer periods spent in space in a regular environment gravity exerts a downward force setting up a vertical hydrostatic gradient when standing some excess fluid resides in vessels and tissues of the legs in a micro-g environment with the loss of a hydrostatic gradient some fluid quickly redistributes toward the chest and upper body sensed as overload of circulating blood volume in the micro-g environment the newly sensed excess blood volume is adjusted by expelling excess fluid into tissues and cells 12-15 volume reduction and red blood cells are adjusted downward to maintain a normal concentration relative anemia in the absence of gravity venous blood will rush to the right atrium because the force of gravity is no longer pulling the blood down into the vessels of the legs and abdomen resulting in increased stroke volume these fluid shifts become more dangerous upon returning to a regular gravity environment as the body will attempt to adapt to the reintroduction of gravity the reintroduction of gravity again will pull the fluid downward but now there would be a deficit in both circulating fluid and red blood cells the decrease in cardiac filling pressure and stroke volume during the orthostatic stress due to a decreased blood volume is what causes orthostatic intolerance orthostatic intolerance can result in temporary loss of consciousness and posture due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume more chronic orthostatic intolerance can result in additional symptoms such as nausea sleep problems and other vasomotor symptoms as well.nmany studies on the physiological effects of weightlessness on the cardiovascular system are done in parabolic flights it is one of the only feasible options to combine with human experiments making parabolic flights the only way to investigate the true effects of the micro-g environment on a body without traveling into space parabolic flight studies have provided a broad range of results regarding changes in the cardiovascular system in a micro-g environment parabolic flight studies have increased the understanding of orthostatic intolerance and decreased peripheral blood flow suffered by astronauts returning to earth due to the loss of blood to pump the heart can atrophy in a micro-g environment a weakened heart can result in low blood volume low blood pressure and affect the bodys ability to send oxygen to the brain without the individual becoming dizzy heart rhythm disturbances have also been seen among astronauts but it is not clear whether this was due to pre-existing conditions of effects of a micro-g environment one current countermeasure includes drinking a salt solution which increases the viscosity of blood and would subsequently increase blood pressure which would mitigate post micro-g environment orthostatic intolerance another countermeasure includes administration of midodrine which is a selective alpha-1 adrenergic agonist midodrine produces arterial and venous constriction resulting in an increase in blood pressure by baroreceptor reflexes.nnimpacts to worker safetyeditnspace motion sickness can lead to degraded astronaut performance sms threatens operational requirements reduces situational awareness and threatens the safety of those exposed to micro-g environments lost muscle mass leads to difficulty with movement especially when astronauts return to earth this can pose a safety issue if the need for emergency egress were to arise loss of muscle power makes it extremely difficult if not impossible for astronauts to climb through emergency egress hatches or create unconventional exit spaces in the case of a crash upon landing additionally bone resorption and inadequate hydration in space can lead to the formation of kidney stones and subsequent sudden incapacitation due to pain if this were to occur during critical phases of flight a capsule crash leading to worker injury and/or death could result short-term and long-term health effects have been seen in the cardiovascular system from exposure to the micro-g environment that would limit those exposed after they return to earth or a regular gravity environment steps need to be taken to ensure proper precautions are taken into consideration when dealing a micro-g environment for worker safety orthostatic intolerance can lead to temporary loss of consciousness due to the lack of pressure and stroke volume this loss of consciousness inhibits and endangers those affected and can lead to deadly consequences.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
