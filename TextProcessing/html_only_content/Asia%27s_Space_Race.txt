comparison of asian national space programs wikipedia n redirected from asias space racen jump to navigationnjump to searchnseveral asian countries have space programs and are actively competing to achieve scientific and technological advancements in space a situation sometimes referred to as the asian space race in the popular media as a reference to the earlier space race between the united states and the soviet union like the previous space race issues involved in the current push to space include national security which has spurred many countries to send artificial satellites as well as humans into earth orbit and beyond a number of asian countries are seen as contenders in the ongoing race to be the pre-eminent power in space.nncontentsnnnasian space powerseditnsee also timeline of first orbital launches by countrynof the ten countries that have independently successfully launched a satellite into orbit six are asian china india iran israel japan and north korea.nchinas first manned spacecraft entered orbit in october 2003 making china the first asian nation to send a human into space india expects to send astronauts to space in the gaganyaan capsule by 2022.nwhile the achievements of space programs run by the main asian space players china india and japan pale in comparison to the milestones set by the former soviet union and the united states some experts believe asia may soon lead the world in space exploration china has been the leader of asias space race since the beginning of the 21st century the first chinese manned spaceflight in 2003 marked the beginning of a space race in the region at the same time the existence of a space race in asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the united states and the soviet union japan for example was the first power on earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid there was however some concurrence between china and india to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the earths moon back in the late 2000s decade china for example denies that there is an asian space race.nin january 2007 china became the first asian military-space power to send an anti-satellite missile into orbit to destroy an aging chinese feng yun 1c weather satellite in polar orbit the resulting explosion sent a wave of debris hurtling through space at more than 6 miles per second a month later japans space agency launched an experimental communications satellite designed to enable super high-speed data transmission in remote areas.nafter successful achievement of geostationary technology indias isro launched its first moon mission chandrayaan-1 in october 2008 which discovered ice water on the moon india then launched on 5 november 2013 its maiden interplanetary mission the mars orbiter mission the primary objective is to determine mars atmospheric composition and attempt to detect methane the spacecraft completed its journey on 24 september 2014 when it entered its intended orbit around mars making india the first asian country to successfully place a mars orbiter and the only country in history to do so in the first attempt isro became the fourth space agency in the world to send a spacecraft to mars only behind nasa roscosmos and esa.nin addition to increasing national pride countries are commercially motivated to operate in space commercial satellites are launched for communications weather forecasting and atmospheric research according to a report by the space frontier foundation released in 2006 the space economy is estimated to be worth about 180 billion with more than 60 of space-related economic activity coming from commercial goods and services china and india propose the initiation of a commercial launch service.nnchinaeditnmain article chinese space programnchina has a space program with an independent human spaceflight capability it has developed a sizable family of successful long march rockets it has launched two lunar orbiters change 1 and change 2 on 2 december 2013 china launched a modified long march 3b rocket with change 3 moon lander and its rover yutu on-board toward the moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations becoming the third country to do so it also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017 in 2011 china embarked on a program to establish a manned space station starting with the launch of tiangong 1 and followed by tiangong 2 in 2016 china attempted to send a mars orbiter yinghuo-1 in 2011 on a joint mission with russia which failed to leave earth orbit nevertheless the 2020 chinese mars mission with an orbiter a lander and a rover has been approved by the government and is aiming a launch date in the year 2020 china has collaborative projects with russia esa and brazil and has launched commercial satellites for other countries some analysts suggest that the chinese space program is linked to the nations efforts at developing advanced military technology.nchinas advanced technology is the result of the integration of various related technological experiences early chinese satellites such as the fsw series have undergone many atmospheric reentry tests in the 1990s china had commercial launches resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s china has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like solar system exploration chinas shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an eva in september 2008 chinas shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in june 2012 furthermore chinas change 2 explorer became the first object to reach sun-earth lagrangian point in august 2011 and also the first probe to explore both moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid 4179 toutatis china has launched dampe the most capable dark matter explorer to date in 2015 and worlds first quantum communication satellite quess in 2016.nnindiaeditnmain article indian space research organisationnindias interest in space travel began in the early 1960s when scientists launched a nike-apache rocket from terls kerala under vikram sarabhai the program focused on the practical uses of space in increasing the standard of living remote sensing and communications satellites were placed into orbit.nthe first indian to travel in space was rakesh sharma who flew aboard soyuz t-11 launched april 2 1984 from erstwhile ussr.njust a few days after china said that it would send a human into orbit in the second half of 2003 indian prime minister atal bihari vajpayee publicly urged his countrys scientists to work towards sending a man to the moon it successfully sent its probe to the moon in october 2008 and is planning its second moon mission chandrayaan-2 for 2019.nisro launched its mars orbiter mission on november 5 2013 informally called mangalyaan which successfully entered into the orbit around mars on 24 september 2014 india is the first in asia and fourth in the world to perform a successful mars mission it is also the only one to do so on the first attempt and at a record low cost of 74 million.nisro has demonstrated its re-entry technology and till date has launched as many as 175 foreign satellites belonging to global customers from 20 countries including us germany france japan canada u.k all of these have been launched successfully by pslvs so far gaining significant expertise in space technologies in june 2016 india set a record by launching 20 satellites simultaneously the pslvs are also one of worlds most reliable launch vehicles which clocked its 35th successful mission 39 total in a row as of february 2017 thus having success rate of nearly 90%.nindia broke the world record by successfully placing 104 satellites almost tripling the russian record of 37 in earth orbit on 15 february 2017 on a single rocket launch pslv-c37.nrecent reports indicate that human spaceflight is planned with a spacecraft called gaganyaan for december 2021 on a home-grown gslv-iii rocket isro is also planning to send orbiters to venus mars and jupiter or comets and asteroids in the near future.nnjapaneditnmain article jaxan the h-iia f11 launch vehicle lifts off from tanegashima space center in japannjapan has been cooperating with the united states on missile defence since 1999

in 1998 the north korean government claimed the missile was merely launching a satellite to space and accused japan of causing an arms race the japanese constitution adopted after world war ii limits military activities to defensive operations on may 2007 prime minister shinzo abe called for a bold review of the japanese constitution to allow the country to take a larger role in global security and foster a revival of national pride japan has not yet developed its own manned spacecraft and does not have a program in place to develop one the japanese space shuttle hope-x to be launched by the conventional space launcher h-ii was developed but the program was postponed and eventually cancelled then the simpler manned capsule fuji was proposed but not adopted pioneer projects of single-stage to orbit reusable launch vehicle horizontal takeoff and landing assts and vertical takeoff and landing kankoh-maru were developed but have not been adopted a more conservative new jaxa manned spacecraft project is proposed to launch by 2025 as part of the japanese plan to send manned missions to the moon shinya matsuura is doubtful about the japanese manned moon project and suspects the project is a euphemism for participation in the american constellation program jaxa planned to send a humanoid robot such as asimo to the moon.nnother minor playerseditniraneditnmain article iranian

article moon landingnthe first confirmed moon landing from asia was hitens mission in 1993 an intentional hard landing at the end of the mission some pictures of the lunar surface were taken before impact hiten was not designed as a moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration the next japanese moon landing program was the lunar-a developed from 1992 although the lunar-a orbiter was cancelled its penetrators are integrated into the russian luna-glob program which was scheduled to launch in 2011 the penetrators are relatively hard landers but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.nthe first asian probe that was part of a lunar landing program was the indian moon impact probe mip released from chandrayaan-1 in 2008 mip was a hard lander and was designed to move the ground under for research purposes mip was designed to be destroyed at impact its instruments performed lunar observations to within 25 minutes before impact the landing test will be applied to future soft landings such as chandrayaan-2 planned for 2019.nthe chinese change-1 spacecraft also achieved a systematic hard landing at the end of its mission in 2009 when china became the
