cirrostratus cloud wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnncirrostratus srostrts is a high-level very thin generally uniform stratiform genus-type of cloud composed of ice-crystals it is difficult to detect and is capable of forming halos when the cloud takes the form of thin cirrostratus nebulosus the cloud has a fibrous texture with no halos if it is thicker cirrostratus fibratus on the approach of a frontal system the cirrostratus often begins as nebulosus and turns to fibratus if the cirrostratus begins as fragmented fibratus it often means the front is weak cirrostratus is usually located above 5.5 km 18,000 ft its presence indicates a large amount of moisture in the upper atmosphere.nn cirrostratus at night causing a moon haloncirrostratus clouds sometimes signal the approach of a warm front if they form after cirrus and spread from one area across the sky and thus may be signs that precipitation might follow in the next 12 to 24 hours or as soon as 68 hours if the front is fast moving if the cirrostratus is broken fibratus it can mean that the front is weak and that stratus rather than nimbostratus will be the precipitating cloud meaning drizzle or snow grains instead of moderate rain or snow cumulus humilis or stratocumulus clouds are often found below cirrostratus formations due to the stable air associated with cirrostratus creating an inversion and restricting convection causing cumuliform clouds to become flattened contrails also tend to spread out and can be visible for up to an hour in cirrostratus.nthe phrase milky sunshine is often as well as referring to haze or light mist used to refer to the milky look of the sky when cirrostratus is present.nn high cloud weather map symbols.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
