river by discharge volume of water in the world and by some definitions it is the longest.nthe headwaters of the apurmac river on nevado mismi had been considered for nearly a century as the amazons most distant source until a 2014 study found it to be the cordillera rumi cruz at the headwaters of the mantaro river in peru the mantaro and apurmac join and with other tributaries form the ucayali river which in turn meets the maran river upstream of iquitos peru to form what countries other than brazil consider to be the main stem of the amazon brazilians call this section the solimes river

into the atlantic ocean yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river.nncontentsnnnorigin of the nameeditnthe river was initially known by europeans as the maran and the peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today it later became known as the rio amazonas in spanish and portuguese or the amazon in english.nthe name rio amazonas was given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by francisco de orellana the warriors were led by women reminding de orellana of the amazon warriors a tribe of women warriors related to iranian scythians and sarmatians mentioned in greek mythology.nthe word amazon itself may be derived from the iranian compound ha-maz-an one fighting together or ethnonym ha-mazan warriors a word attested indirectly through a derivation a denominal verb in hesychius of alexandrias gloss hamazakaran to make war in persian where it appears together with the indo-iranian root kar make from which sanskrit karma is also derived.nnhistoryeditnmain article timeline of amazon historynpre-columbian eraeditn pwanchir pitu achuar shamannduring what many archaeologists call the formative stage amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of south americas highland agrarian systems the trade with andean civilisations in the terrains of the headwaters in the andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of the higher altitude civilisations of among others the muisca and incas early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.nshell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation they represent piles of human refuse and are mainly dated between 7500 and 4000 years bp they are associated with ceramic age cultures no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds they are best represented by the marajoara culture figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation.nthere is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the amazon river were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies mainly chiefdoms who developed large towns and cities archaeologists estimate that by the time the spanish conquistador de orellana traveled across the amazon in 1541 more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the amazon these pre-columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations for instance pre-columbian indigenous people on the island of maraj may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people in order to achieve this level of development the indigenous inhabitants of the amazon rainforest altered the forests ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repetitiously the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients this created dark soil areas known as terra preta de ndio indian dark earth because of the terra preta indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the amazon basin.nmany indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare james stuart olson wrote the munduruku expansion dislocated and displaced the kawahb breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups munduruku first came to the attention of europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on brazilian settlements along the amazon river."nnarrival of europeanseditn amazon tributaries near manausnin march 1500 spanish conquistador vicente yez pinzn was the first documented european to sail up the amazon river pinzn called the stream ro santa mara del mar dulce later shortened to mar dulce literally sweet sea because of its fresh water pushing out into the ocean another spanish explorer francisco de orellana was the first european to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins situated in the andes to the mouth of the river in this journey orellana baptised some of the affluents of the amazonas like rio negro napo and jurua the name amazonas is taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition mostly women that reminded de orellana of the mythical female amazon warriors from the ancient hellenic culture in greece.nnexplorationeditn samuel fritzs 1707 map showing the amazon and the orinocon native mundurukpainting by hercules florencengonzalo pizarro set off in 1541 to explore east of quito into the south american interior in search of el dorado the city of gold and la canela the valley of cinnamon he was accompanied by his second-in-command francisco de orellana after 170 kilometres 110 mi the coca river joined the napo river at a point now known as puerto francisco de orellana the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence they continued downriver through an uninhabited area where they could not find food orellana offered and was ordered to follow the napo river then known as ro de la canela cinnamon river and return with food for the party based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named delicola they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.nde orellana took about 57 men the boat and some canoes and left pizarros troops on 26 december 1541 however de orellana apparently missed the confluence probably with the aguarico where he was searching supplies for his men by the time he and his men reached another village many of them were sick from hunger and eating noxious plants and near death seven men died at that village his men threatened to mutiny if he followed his orders and the expedition turned back to join pizarros larger party he accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of spain and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream after a journey of 600 km down the napo river they reached a further major confluence at a point near modern iquitos and then followed the upper amazon now known as the solimes for a further 1,200 kilometres 750 mi to its confluence with the rio negro near modern manaus which they reached on 3 june 1542 on the nhamunda river a tributary of the amazon downstream from manaus orellanas party had a fierce battle with warriors who they reported were led by fierce female warriors who beat the men to death with clubs if they tried to retreat orellanas men began referring to the women as amazons a reference to the tribe of women warriors from greek mythology.nregarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees but that they could not be profitably harvested in fact true cinnamon cinnamomum verum is not native to south america other related cinnamon-containing plants of the family lauraceae are fairly common in that part of the amazon and pizarro probably saw some of these the expedition reached the mouth of the amazon on 24 august 1542 demonstrating the practical navigability of the great river.nin 1560 another spanish conquistador lope de aguirre may have made the second descent of the amazon historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the amazon or the orinoco river which runs more or less parallel to the amazon further north.nportuguese explorer pedro teixeira was the first european to travel up the entire river he arrived in quito in 1637 and returned via the same route.nfrom 1648 to 1652 portuguese brazilian bandeirante antnio raposo tavares led an expedition from so paulo overland to the mouth of the amazon investigating many of its tributaries including the rio negro and covering a distance of more than 10,000 km 6,214 mi.nin what is currently brazil ecuador bolivia colombia peru and venezuela a number of colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for the purpose of trade slaving and evangelisation among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest such as the urarina in the late 1600s czech jesuit father samuel fritz apostle of the omaguas established some forty mission villages fritz proposed that the maran river must be the source of the amazon noting on his 1707 map that the maran has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called lauricocha near hunuco fritz reasoned that the maran is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the amazon for most of the 18th19th centuries and into the 20th century the maran was generally considered the source of the amazon.nnscientific explorationeditn henry walter bates was most famous for his expedition to the amazon 18481859.nearly scientific zoological and botanical exploration of the amazon river and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.nnnpost-colonial exploitation and settlementeditn amazonas staten amazon theatre opera house in manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boomnnthe cabanagem revolt 18351840 was directed against the white ruling class it is estimated that from 30 to 40 of the population of gro-par estimated at 100,000 people died.nthe total population of the brazilian portion of the amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000 of whom about two-thirds were europeans and slaves the slaves amounting to about 25,000 the brazilian amazons principal commercial city par now belm had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants including slaves the town of manos now manaus at the mouth of the rio negro had a population between 1,000 and 1,500 all the remaining villages as far up as tabatinga on the brazilian frontier of peru were relatively small.non 6 september 1850 emperor pedro ii of brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the amazon and gave the viscount of mau irineu evangelista de sousa the task of putting it into effect he organised the companhia de navegao e comrcio do amazonas in rio de janeiro in 1852 in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers the monarca monarch the camet the maraj and the rio negro.nat first navigation was principally confined to the main river and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between par and manaus with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity a second line to make six round voyages a year between manaus and tabatinga and a third two trips a month between par and camet this was the first step in opening up the vast interior.nthe success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the amazon and a second company soon opened commerce on the madeira purs and negro a third established a line between par and manaus and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams in that same period the amazonas company was increasing its fleet meanwhile private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.non 31 july 1867 the government of brazil constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper amazon basin especially peru decreed the opening of the amazon to all countries but they limited this to certain defined points tabatinga on the amazon camet on the tocantins santarm on the tapajs borba on the madeira and manaus on the rio negro the brazilian decree took effect on 7 september 1867.nthanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber the peruvian city of iquitos became a thriving cosmopolitan centre of commerce foreign companies settled in iquitos from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber in 1851 iquitos had a population of 200 and by 1900 its population reached 20,000 in the 1860s approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons representing 9.3 of perus exports during the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants such as typhus and malaria killed 40,000 native amazonians.nthe first direct foreign trade with manaus commenced around 1874 local trade along the river was carried on by the english successors to the amazonas companythe amazon steam navigation companyas well as numerous small steamboats belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade navigating the negro madeira purs and many other tributaries such as the maran to ports as distant as nauta peru.nby the turn of the 20th century the exports of the amazon basin were india-rubber cacao beans brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance such as pelts and exotic forest produce resins barks woven hammocks prized bird feathers live animals and extracted goods such as lumber and gold.nn20th-century developmenteditn manaus the largest city in amazonas as seen from a nasa satellite image surrounded by the dark rio negro and the muddy amazon rivern floating houses in leticia colombiansince colonial times the portuguese portion of the amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of european diseases.nfour centuries after the european discovery of the amazon river the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than 65 square kilometres 25 sq mi excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters this situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.nwary of foreign exploitation of the nations resources brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land the original architect of this expansion was president getlio vargas with the demand for rubber from the allied forces in world war ii providing funding for the drive.nin the 1960s economic exploitation of the amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the economic miracle occurring at the time this resulted in the development of operation amazon an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to amazonia this was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.nhowever in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the national integration programme a large-scale colonization programme saw families from northeastern brazil relocated to the land without people in the amazon basin this was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the trans-amazonian highway transamaznica.nthe trans-amazonian highways three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise large portions of the trans-amazonian and its accessory roads such as br-319 manaus-porto velho are derelict and impassable in the rainy season small towns and villages are scattered across the forest and because its vegetation is so dense some remote areas are still unexplored.nmany settlements grew along the road from braslia to belm with the highway and national integration programme however the programme failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem this although the government believed it could sustain millions instead could sustain very few.nwith a population of 1.9 million people in 2014 manaus is the largest city on the amazon manaus alone makes up approximately 50 of the population of the largest brazilian state of amazonas the racial makeup of the city is 64 pardo mulatto and mestizo and 32 white.nalthough the amazon river remains largely undammed around 412 dams are in operation in the amazons tributary rivers from these 412 dams 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the amazon since only four percent of the amazons hydropower potential has been developed in countries like brazil more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned after witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation sedimentation navigation and flood control caused by the three gorges dam in the yangtze river scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by blocking-fish spawning runs reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests damming the amazon river could potentially bring about the end of free flowing rivers and contribute to an ecosystem collapse that will cause major social problems.nncourseeditnoriginseditnmain article source of the amazon rivern the amazon was thought to originate from the apacheta cliff in arequipa at the nevado mismi marked only by a wooden cross.n source of the amazonn maran river in perunthe most distant source of the amazon was thought to be in the apurmac river drainage for nearly a century such studies continued to be published even recently such as in 1996 2001 2007 and 2008 where various authors identified the snowcapped 5,597 m 18,363 ft nevado mismi peak located roughly 160 km 99 mi west of lake titicaca and 700 km 430 mi southeast of lima as the most distant source of the river from that point quebrada carhuasanta emerges from nevado mismi joins quebrada apacheta and soon forms ro lloqueta which becomes ro hornillos and eventually joins the ro apurmac.na 2014 study by americans james contos and nicolas tripcevich in area a peer-reviewed journal of the royal geographical society however identifies the most distant source of the amazon as actually being in the ro mantaro drainage a variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the mantaro river vs the apurmac river from their most distant source points to their confluence showing the longer length of the mantaro then distances from lago junn to several potential source points in the uppermost mantaro river were measured which enabled them to determine that the cordillera rumi cruz was the most distant source of water in the mantaro basin and therefore in the entire amazon basin the most accurate measurement method was direct gps measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence performed by contos obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class ivv nature of each of these rivers especially in their lower abyss sections ultimately they determined that the most distant point in the mantaro drainage is nearly 80 km farther upstream compared to mt mismi in the apurmac drainage and thus the maximal length of the amazon river is about 80 km longer than previously thought contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the amazon river from its newly identified source finishing november 2012 a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.nafter about 700 km 430 mi the apurmac then joins ro mantaro to form the ene which joins the perene to form the tambo which joins the urubamba river to form the ucayali after the confluence of apurmac and ucayali the river leaves andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain from this point to the confluence of the ucayali and the maran some 1,600 km 990 mi the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage the low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills and the river enters the enormous amazon rainforest.nnthe upper amazon or solimeseditn amazon river near iquitos perunalthough the ucayalimaran confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the amazon river proper in brazil the river is known at this point as the solimes das guas the river systems and flood plains in brazil peru ecuador colombia and venezuela whose waters drain into the solimes and its tributaries are called the upper amazon".nthe amazon proper runs mostly through brazil and peru and is part of the border between colombia and per it has a series of major tributaries in colombia ecuador and peru some of which flow into the maran and ucayali and others directly into the amazon proper these include rivers putumayo caquet vaups guaina morona pastaza nucuray urituyacu chambira tigre nanay napo and huallaga.nat some points the river divides into anabranches or multiple channels often very long with inland and lateral channels all connected by a complicated system of natural canals cutting the low flat igap lands which are never more than 5 metres 16 ft above low river into many islands.nfrom the town of canaria at the great bend of the amazon to the negro vast areas of land are submerged at high water above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests

of the rio negro meet the sandy coloured rio solimes and for over 6 km 4 mi these waters run side by side without mixing at bidos a bluff 17 m 56 ft above the river is backed by low hills the lower amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the atlantic ocean the waters of which washed the cliffs near bidos.nonly about ten percent of the amazons water enters downstream of bidos very little of

kilometres 390,000 sq mi around 20 exclusive of the 1,400,000 square kilometres 540,000 sq mi of the tocantins basin the tocantins river enters the southern portion of the amazon delta.nin the lower reaches of the river the north bank consists of a series of steep table-topped hills extending for about 240 kilometres 150 mi from opposite the mouth of the xingu as far as monte alegre these hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.non the south bank above the xingu a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to santarm in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest and abutting upon the lower tapajs merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the tapajs river valley.nnmoutheditn satellite image of the mouth of the amazon river from the north looking southnbelm is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the atlantic ocean the definition of where exactly the mouth of the amazon is located and how wide it is is a matter of dispute because of the areas peculiar geography the par and the amazon are connected by a series of river channels called furos near the town of breves between them lies maraj the worlds largest combined river/sea island.nif the par river and the maraj island ocean frontage are included the amazon estuary is some 325 kilometres 202 mi wide in this case the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from cabo norte the cape located straight east of pracuba in the brazilian state of amap to ponta da tijoca near the town of curu in the state of par.na more conservative measurement excluding the par river estuary from the mouth of the araguari river to ponta do navio on the northern coast of maraj would still give the mouth of the amazon a width of over 180 kilometres 110 mi if only the rivers main channel is considered between the islands of curu state of amap and jurupari state of par the width falls to about 15 kilometres 9.3 mi.nthe plume generated by the rivers discharge covers up to 1.3 million square kilometres and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north atlantic in terms of salinity ph light penetration and sedimentation.nnbridgeseditnthere are no bridges across the entire width of the river this is not because the river would be too wide to bridge for most of its length engineers could build a bridge across the river easily for most of its course the river flows through the amazon rainforest where there are very few roads and cities most of the time the crossing can be done by a ferry so there is no need to build a bridge the manaus iranduba bridge linking the cities of manaus and iranduba spans the rio negro a tributary of the amazon.nndispute regarding lengtheditn river taxi in perunsee also coastline paradoxnwhile debate as to whether the amazon or the nile is the worlds longest river has gone on for many years the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the amazon as the second longest river in the world with the nile being the longest however the amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275 and 7,025 kilometres 3,899 and 4,365 mi long it is often said to be at least 6,400 kilometres 4,000 mi long the nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088 kilometres 3,417 to 4,404 mi often it is said to be about 6,650 kilometres 4,130 mi long there are many factors that can affect these measurements such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth the scale of measurement and the length measuring techniques for details see also list of rivers by length.na study by brazilian scientists concluded that the amazon is actually longer than the nile using nevado mismi which in 2001 was labelled by the national geographic society as the amazons source these scientists made new calculations of the amazons length they calculated the amazons length as 6,992 kilometres 4,345 mi using the same techniques they calculated the length of the nile as 6,853 kilometres 4,258 mi which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the amazon they made it possible by measuring the amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of canal do sul and then after a sharp turn back following tidal canals surrounding the isle of maraj and finally including the marine waters of the ro par bay in its entire length guido gelli director of science at the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge told the brazilian tv network globo in june 2007 that it could be considered as a fact that the amazon was the longest river in the world however other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001 and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these brazilian scientists a peer-reviewed article published in 2009 concluded that the nile is longer than the amazon by stating a length of 7,088 km 4,404 mi for the nile and 6,575 km 4,086 mi for the amazon measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.ntherefore as of 2018 the length of both amazon and nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate.nnwatershededitnmain article amazon basinnthe amazon basin the largest in the world covers about 40 of south america an area of approximately 7,050,000 square kilometres 2,722,020 sq mi it drains from west to east from iquitos in peru across brazil to the atlantic it gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude its most remote sources are found on the inter-andean plateau just a short distance from the pacific ocean.nthe amazon river and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season every year the river rises more than 9 metres 30 ft flooding the surrounding forests known as vrzea flooded forests the amazons flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world in an average dry season 110,000 square kilometres 42,000 sq mi of land are water-covered while in the wet season the flooded area of the amazon basin rises

with an average of 209,000 cubic metres per second 7,400,000 cu ft/s from 1973 to 1990 the amazon is responsible for about 20 of the earths fresh water entering the ocean the river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean the plume is about 400 kilometres 250 mi long and between 100 and 200 kilometres 62 and 124 mi wide the fresh water being lighter flows on top of the seawater diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to 2,500,000 km 970,000 sq mi in extent for centuries ships have reported fresh water near the amazons mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.nthe atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the amazons sediments out to sea thus the amazon does not form a true delta the great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water while the amazon empties directly into the turbulent atlantic.nthere is a natural water union between the amazon and the orinoco basins the so-called casiquiare canal the casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper orinoco which flows southward into the rio negro which in turn flows into the amazon the

called the pororoca with a leading wave that can be up to 25 feet 7.6 m high and travel up to 500 miles 800 km inland.nngeologyeditnthe amazon river originated as a transcontinental river in the miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the early pleistocene.nthe proto-amazon during the cretaceous flowed west as part of a proto-amazon-congo river system from the interior of present-day africa when the continents were connected forming western gondwana fifteen million years ago the main tectonic uplift phase of the andean chain started this tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the nazca plate underneath the south american plate the rise of the andes and the linkage of the brazilian and guyana bedrock shields blocked the river and caused the amazon basin to become a vast inland sea gradually this inland sea became a massive swampy freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater for example over 20 species of stingray most closely related to those found in the pacific ocean can be found today in the freshwaters of the amazon.neleven to ten million years ago waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the amazon began to flow eastward leading to the emergence of the amazon rainforest during glacial periods sea levels dropped and the great amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river which would eventually become the worlds largest draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.nparalleling the amazon river is a large aquifer
