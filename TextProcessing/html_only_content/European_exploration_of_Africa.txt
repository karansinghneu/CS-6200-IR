reasonably well known among europeans since classical antiquity in greco-roman geography northwest africa the maghreb was known as either libya or africa while egypt was considered part of asia.neuropean exploration of sub-saharan africa begins with the age of discovery in the 15th century pioneered by portugal under henry the navigator the cape of good hope was first reached by bartolomeu dias on 12 march 1488 opening the important sea route to india and the far east but european exploration of africa itself remained very limited during the 16th and 17th centuries the european powers were content to establish trading posts along the coast while they were actively exploring and colonizing the new world exploration of the interior of africa was thus mostly left to the arab slave traders who in tandem with the muslim conquest of the sudan established far-reaching networks and supported the economy of a number of sahelian kingdoms during the 15th to 18th centuries.nat the beginning of the 19th century european knowledge of geography of the interior of sub-saharan africa was still rather limited expeditions exploring southern africa were made during the 1830s and 1840s so that around the midpoint of the 19th century and the beginning of the colonial scramble for africa the unexplored parts were now limited to what would turn out to be the congo basin and the african great lakes this heart of africa remained one of the last remaining blank spots on world maps of the later 19th century alongside the arctic antarctic and the interior of the amazon basin it was left for 19th-century european explorers including those searching for the famed sources of the nile notably john hanning speke sir richard burton david livingstone and henry morton stanley to complete the exploration of africa by the 1870s after this the general geography of africa was known but it was left to further expeditions during the 1880s onward notably those led by oskar lenz to flesh more detail such as the continents geological makeup.nncontentsnnnantiquityeditnmain article romans in sub-saharan africanfurther information north africa during the classical periodn reconstruction of hecataeus map of the worldnthe phoenicians explored north africa establishing a number of colonies the most prominent of which was carthage carthage itself conducted exploration of west africa the first circumnavigation of the african continent was probably made by phoenician sailors in an expedition commissioned by egyptian pharaoh necho ii in c 600 bc and took three years a report of this expedition is provided by herodotus 4.37 they sailed south rounded the cape heading west made their way north to the mediterranean and then returned home he states that they paused each year to sow and harvest grain herodotus himself is sceptical of the historicity of this feat which would have taken place close about 120 years before his birth however the reason he gives for disbelieving the story is the sailors reported claim that when they sailed along the southern coast of africa they found the sun stood to their right in the north herodotus who was unaware of the spherical shape of the earth found this impossible to believe some commentators took this circumstance as proof that the voyage is historical but other scholars still dismiss the report as unlikely.nnthe west african coast may have been explored by hanno the navigator in an expedition in c 500 bc the report of this voyage survives in a short periplus in greek which was first cited by greek authors in the 3rd century bc there is some uncertainty as to how far precisely hanno reached he clearly sailed as far as sierra leone and may have continued as far as guinea or even gabon however robin law notes that some commentators have argued that hanno exploration have taken him no further than southern morocco.nafrica is named for the afri people who settled in the area of current-day tunisia the roman province of africa spanned the mediterranean coast of what is now libya tunisia and algeria the parts of north africa north of the sahara were well known in antiquity prior to the 2nd century bc however greek geographers were unaware that the land mass then known as libya expanded south of the sahara assuming that the desert bounded on the outer ocean indeed alexander the great according to plutarchus lives considered sailing from the mouths of the indus back to macedonia passing south of africa as a shortcut compared to the land route even eratosthenes around 200 bc still assumed an extent of the landmass no further south than the horn of africa.nby the roman imperial period the horn of africa was well-known to mediterranean geographers the trading post of rhapta described as the last marketplace of azania may correspond to the coast of tanzania the periplus of the erythraean sea dated to the 1st century ad appears to extend geographical knowledge further south to southeast africa ptolemys world map of the 2nd century is well aware that the african continent extents significantly further south than the horn of africa but has no geographic detail south of the equator it is unclear whether it is aware of the gulf of guineannarab slave tradeeditnmain articles arab slave trade islamization of the sudan region and sahelian kingdomsnin the medieval period the exploration of the interior of the sahara and the sahel as well as along the swahili coast as far as mozambique was the project of muslim conquests and slave trade it was at mozambique that the arab clockwise and the portuguese counter-clockwise routes of exploration would meet at the end of the 15th century.nfollowing its 8th-century conquest of north africa arab muslims ventured into sub-saharan africa first along the nile valley towards nubia and later also across the sahara towards west africa they were interested in the trans-saharan trade especially in slaves.nthis expansion of arab and islamic culture was a gradual process lasting throughout most of the middle ages the christian kingdoms of nubia came under pressure from the 7th century but they resisted for several centuries the kingdom of makuria and old dongola collapsed by the beginning of the 14th century a significant role in the spread of islam in africa was taken by sufi orders during the 9th to 14th centuries who spread south along trade routes between north africa and the sub-saharan kingdoms of ghana and mali on the west african coast they set up zawiyas on the shores of the river niger the mali empire became islamic following the pilgrimage of musa i of mali in 1324 timbuktu became an important center of islamic culture south of the sahara alodia the last remnant of christian nubia was destroyed by the funj in 1504.nnnearly portuguese expeditionseditnfurther information history of portugal 14151578 portuguese discoveries and portuguese explorersn henry the

were caught by a storm naming it cape of storms they followed the coast for a while realizing that it kept going eastward with even some tendency to the north lacking supplies they turned around with the conviction that the far end of africa had finally been reached upon their return to portugal the promising cape was renamed cape of good hope.nsome years later christopher columbus landed in

directly to calicut on august 28 1498 king manuel of portugal informed the pope of the good news that portugal had reached india.negypt and venice reacted to this news with hostility from the red sea they jointly attacked the portuguese ships that traded with india the portuguese defeated these ships near diu in 1509 the ottoman empires indifferent reaction to portuguese exploration left portugal in almost exclusive control of trade through the indian ocean they established many bases along the eastern coast of africa except for somalia see ajuran-portuguese wars the portuguese also captured aden in 1513.none of the ships under command of diogo dias arrived at a coast that was not in east africa two years later a chart already showed an elongated island east of africa that bore the name madagascar but only a century later between 1613 and 1619 did the portuguese explore the island in detail they signed treaties with local chieftains and sent the first missionaries who found it

nevertheless a diminished kongo kingdom would still exist until 1885 when the last manicongo pedro v ceded his almost non-existent domain to portugal.nthe portuguese dealt with the other major state of southern africa the monomotapa in modern zimbabwe in a similar manner portugal intervened in a local war hoping to get abundant mineral riches imposing a protectorate but with the authority of the monomotapa diminished by the foreign presence anarchy took over the local miners migrated and even buried the mines to prevent them from falling into portuguese hands when in 1693 the neighbouring cangamires invaded the country the portuguese accepted their failure and retreated to the coast.nndutcheditnbeginning in the 17th century the netherlands began exploring and colonizing africa while the dutch were waging a long war of independence against spain portugal had temporarily united with spain starting in 1580 and ending in 1640 as a result the growing colonial ambitions of the netherlands were mostly directed against portugal.nfor this purpose two dutch companies were founded the west indies company with power over all the atlantic ocean and the east indies company with power over the indian ocean.nthe west india company conquered elmina in 1637 and luanda in 1640 in 1648 they were expelled from luanda by the portuguese overall the dutch built 16 forts in different places including gore in senegal partly overtaking portugal as the main slave-trading power the dutch gold coast and dutch slave coast were successful.nbut in the colony of dutch loango-angola the portuguese managed to expel the dutch.nin dutch mauritius the colonization started in 1638 and ended in 1710 with a brief interruption between 1658 and 1666 numerous governors were appointed but

resulting in the death of most of the colonists the english forts on the west african coast were eventually taken by the dutch.nin 1626 the french compagnie de loccident was created this company expelled the dutch from senegambia senegal making it the first french domain in africa,they also conquered the island of arguin nfrance also set her eyes on madagascar the island that had been used since 1527 as a stop in travels to india in 1642 the french east india company founded a settlement in southern madagascar called fort dauphin the commercial results of this settlement were scarce and again most of the settlers died one of the survivors etienne de flacourt published a history of the great island of madagascar and relations which was for a long time the main european source of information about the island further settlement attempts had no more success but in 1667 franois martin led the first expedition to the malgasy heartland reaching lake alaotra in 1665 france officially claimed madagascar under the name of le dauphine however little colonial activity would take place in madagascar until the 19th century.nin 1651 the duchy of courland and semigallia a vassal of the polish-lithuanian commonwealth gained a colony in africa on st andrews island at the gambia river and established the jacob fort there the duchy also took other local land including st

foundations were laid of the fort carlsborg.in 1658 fort carlsborg was seized and made part of the danish gold coast colony,then to the dutch gold coast later on the local population started a successful uprising against their new masters and in december 1660 the king of the akan people subgroup-efutu again offered sweden control over the area but in 1663 were seized by the danish after a long defense of fort christiansborg.nthe dano-norwegian colonized the danish gold coast from 1674 to 1755 the settlements were administered by the danish west india-guinea company from december 1680 to 29 august 1682 the portuguese occupied fort christiansborg in 1750 it was made a danish crown colony from 1782 to 1785 it was under british occupation.from 1814 it was made part of the territory of denmark.nin 1677 king frederick william i of prussia sent an expedition to the western coast of africa the commander of the expedition captain blonk signed agreements with the chieftains of the gold coast there the prussians built a fort named gross friederichsburg and restored the abandoned portuguese fort of arguin but in 1720 the king decided to sell these bases to the netherlands for 7,000 ducats and 12 slaves six of them chained with pure gold chains.nin 1777,the spanish empire and portuguese empire signed the treaty of san ildefonso in which portugal give the islands of annobn and fernando poo in waters of the gulf of guinea as well as the guinean coast between the niger river and the ogoou river to spain.nthe british expressed their interest by the formation in 1788 of the association for promoting the discovery of the interior parts of africa the individuals who formed this club were inspired in part by the scotsman james bruce who had ventured to ethiopia in 1769 and reached the source of the blue nile.noverall european exploration of africa in the 17th and 18th centuries was very limited instead they were focused on the slave trade which only required coastal bases and items to trade the real exploration of the african interior would start well into the 19th century.nnthe 19th centuryeditnsee also colonisation of africa scramble for africa and timeline of

the ottoman empire to regain direct control over that country in 1811 mehemet ali established an almost independent state and from 1820 onward established egyptian rule over the eastern sudan in south africa the struggle with napoleon caused the united kingdom to take possession of the dutch settlements at the cape in 1814 cape colony which had been continuously occupied by british troops since 1806 was formally ceded to the british crown.nmeanwhile considerable changes had been made in other parts of the continent the occupation of algiers by france in 1830 put an end to the piracy of the barbary states egyptian authority continued to expand southward with the consequent additions to knowledge of the nile the city of zanzibar on the island of that name rapidly attained importance accounts of a vast inland sea and the discovery of the snow-clad mountains of kilimanjaro in 18401848 stimulated the desire for further knowledge about africa in europe.nin the mid-19th century protestant missions were carrying on active missionary work on the guinea coast in south africa and in the zanzibar dominions missionaries visited little-known regions and peoples and in many instances became explorers and pioneers of trade and empire david livingstone a scottish missionary had been engaged since 1840 in work north of the orange river in 1849 livingstone crossed the kalahari desert from south to north and reached lake ngami between 1851 and 1856 he traversed the continent from west to east discovering the great waterways of the upper zambezi river in november 1855 livingstone became the first european to see the famous victoria falls named after the queen of the united kingdom from 1858 to 1864 the lower zambezi the shire river and lake nyasa were explored by livingstone nyasa had been first reached by the confidential slave of antnio da silva porto a portuguese trader established at bi in angola who crossed africa during 18531856 from benguella to the mouth of the rovuma a prime goal for explorers was to locate the source of the river nile expeditions by burton and speke 18571858 and speke and grant 1863 located lake tanganyika and lake victoria it was eventually proved to be the latter from which the nile flowed.nhenry morton stanley who had in 1871 succeeded in finding and succouring livingstone originating the famous line dr livingstone i presume started again for zanzibar in 1874 in one of the most memorable of all exploring expeditions in africa stanley circumnavigated victoria nyanza lake victoria and lake tanganyika striking farther inland to the lualaba he followed that river down to the atlantic oceanwhich he reached in august 1877and proved it to be the congo.nn comparison of africa in the years 1880 and 1913nin 1895 the british south africa company hired the american scout frederick russell burnham to look for minerals and ways to improve river navigation in the central and southern africa region burnham oversaw and led the northern territories british south africa exploration company expedition that first established that major copper deposits existed north of the zambezi in north-eastern rhodesia along the kafue river burnham saw many similarities to copper deposits he had worked in the united states and he encountered native peoples wearing copper bracelets copper rapidly became the primary export of central africa and it remains essential to the economy even today.nexplorers were also active in other parts of the continent southern morocco the sahara and the sudan were traversed in many directions between 1860 and 1875 by georg schweinfurth and gustav nachtigal these travellers not only added considerably to geographical knowledge but obtained invaluable information concerning the people languages and natural history of the countries in which they sojourned among the discoveries of schweinfurth was one that confirmed greek legends of the existence beyond egypt of a pygmy race but the first western discoverer of the pygmies of central africa was paul du chaillu who found them in the ogowe district of the west coast in 1865 five years before schweinfurths first meeting with them du chaillu had previously through journeys in the gabon region between 1855 and 1859 made popular in europe the knowledge of the existence of the gorilla whose existence was thought to be as legendary as that of the pygmies of aristotle.nnlist of africa explorerseditnn15th centuryeditn portuguese map of western africa 1571nn15th/16th centuryeditnn16th centuryeditnn18th centuryeditnn19th
