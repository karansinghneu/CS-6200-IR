lightare brought toward or gravitate toward one another on earth gravity gives weight to physical objects and the moons gravity causes the ocean tides the gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the universe caused it to begin coalescing forming stars and for the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large-scale structures in the universe gravity has an infinite range although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.ngravity is most accurately described by the general theory of relativity proposed by albert einstein in 1915 which describes gravity not as a force but as a consequence of the curvature of spacetime caused by the uneven distribution of mass the most extreme example of this curvature of spacetime is a black hole from which nothingnot even lightcan escape once past the black holes event horizon however for most applications gravity is well approximated by newtons law of universal gravitation which describes gravity as a force which causes any two bodies to be attracted to each other with the force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.ngravity is the weakest of the four fundamental forces of physics approximately 10 times weaker than the strong force 10 times weaker than the electromagnetic force and 10 times weaker than the weak force as a consequence it has no significant influence at the level of subatomic particles in contrast it is the dominant force at the macroscopic scale and is the cause of the formation shape and trajectory orbit of astronomical bodies for example gravity causes the earth and the other planets to orbit the sun it also causes the moon to orbit the earth and causes the formation of tides the formation and evolution of the solar system stars and galaxies.nthe earliest instance of gravity in the universe possibly in the form of quantum gravity supergravity or a gravitational singularity along with ordinary space and time developed during the planck epoch up to 10 seconds after the birth of the universe possibly from a primeval state such as a false vacuum quantum vacuum or virtual particle in a currently unknown manner attempts to develop a theory of gravity consistent with quantum mechanics a quantum gravity theory which would allow gravity to be united in a common mathematical framework a theory of everything with the other three forces of physics are a current area of research.nncontentsnnnhistory of gravitational theorynmain article

theory began with the work of galileo galilei in the late 16th and early 17th centuries in his famous though possibly apocryphal experiment dropping balls from the tower of pisa and later with careful measurements of balls rolling down inclines galileo showed that gravitational acceleration is the same for all objects this was a major departure from aristotles belief that heavier objects have a higher gravitational acceleration galileo postulated air resistance as the reason that objects with less mass fall more slowly in an atmosphere galileos work set the stage for the formulation of newtons theory of gravity.nnnewtons theory of gravitationnmain article newtons law of universal gravitationn english physicist and mathematician sir isaac newton 1642-1727nin 1687 english mathematician sir isaac newton published principia which hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation in his own words i deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth and found them answer pretty nearly the equation is the following:nnwhere f is the force m and m are the masses of the objects interacting r is the distance between the centers of the masses and g is the gravitational constant.nnewtons theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of neptune based on motions of uranus that could not be accounted for by the actions of the other planets calculations by both john couch adams and urbain le verrier predicted the general position of the planet and le verriers calculations are what led johann gottfried galle to the discovery of neptune.na discrepancy in mercurys orbit pointed out flaws in newtons theory by the end of the 19th century it was known that its orbit showed slight perturbations that could not be accounted for entirely under newtons theory but all searches for another perturbing body such as a planet orbiting the sun even closer than mercury had been fruitless the issue was resolved in 1915 by albert einsteins new theory of general relativity which accounted for the small discrepancy in mercurys orbit this discrepancy was the advance in the perihelion of mercury of 42.98 arcseconds per century.nalthough newtons theory has been superseded by einsteins general relativity most modern non-relativistic gravitational calculations are still made using newtons theory because it is simpler to work with and it gives sufficiently accurate results for most applications involving sufficiently small masses speeds and energies.nnequivalence principlenthe equivalence principle explored by a succession of researchers including galileo lornd etvs and einstein expresses the idea that all objects fall in the same way and that the effects of gravity are indistinguishable from certain aspects of acceleration and deceleration the simplest way to test the weak equivalence principle is to drop two objects of different masses or compositions in a vacuum and see whether they hit the ground at the same time such experiments demonstrate that all objects fall at the same rate when other forces such as air resistance and electromagnetic effects are negligible more sophisticated tests use a torsion balance of a type invented by etvs satellite experiments for example step are planned for more accurate experiments in space.nformulations of the equivalence principle include:nnngeneral relativitynsee also introduction to general relativityn two-dimensional analogy of spacetime distortion generated by the mass of an object matter changes the geometry of spacetime this curved geometry being interpreted as gravity white lines do not represent the curvature of space but instead represent the coordinate system imposed on the curved spacetime which would be rectilinear in a flat spacetime.nnin general relativity the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of a force the starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle which equates free fall with inertial motion and describes free-falling inertial objects as being accelerated relative to non-inertial observers on the ground in newtonian physics however no such acceleration can occur unless at least one of the objects is being operated on by a force.neinstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter and that free-falling objects are moving along locally straight paths in curved spacetime these straight paths are called geodesics like newtons first law of motion einsteins theory states that if a force is applied on an object it would deviate from a geodesic for instance we are no longer following geodesics while standing because the mechanical resistance of the earth exerts an upward force on us and we are non-inertial on the ground as a result this explains why moving along the geodesics in spacetime is considered inertial.neinstein discovered the field equations of general relativity which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime and are named after him the einstein field equations are a set of 10 simultaneous non-linear differential equations the solutions of the field equations are the components of the metric tensor of spacetime a metric tensor describes a geometry of spacetime the geodesic paths for a spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.nnsolutionsnnotable solutions of the einstein field equations include:nnntestsnthe tests of general relativity included the following:nnngravity and quantum mechanicsnmain articles graviton and quantum gravitynin the decades after the publication of the theory of general relativity it was realized that general relativity is incompatible with quantum mechanics it is possible to describe gravity in the framework of quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces such that the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons this reproduces general relativity in the classical limit however this approach fails at short distances of the order of the planck length where a more complete theory of quantum gravity or a new approach to quantum mechanics is required.nnspecificsnearths gravityn an initially-stationary object that is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance that is proportional to the square of the elapsed time this image spans half a second and was captured at 20 flashes per second.nmain article earths gravitynevery planetary body including the earth is surrounded by its own gravitational field which can be conceptualized with newtonian physics as exerting an attractive force on all objects assuming a spherically symmetrical planet the strength of this field at any given point above the surface is proportional to the planetary bodys mass and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center of the body.nn if an object with comparable mass to that of the earth were to fall towards it then the corresponding acceleration of the earth would be observable.nthe strength of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence the rate of acceleration of falling objects near the earths surface varies very slightly depending on latitude surface features such as mountains and ridges and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities for purposes of weights and measures a standard gravity value is defined by the international bureau of weights and measures under the international system of units si.nthat value denoted g is g 9.80665 m/s 32.1740 ft/s.nthe standard value of 9.80665 m/s is the one originally adopted by the international committee on weights and measures in 1901 for 45 latitude even though it has been shown to be too high by about five parts in ten thousand this value has persisted in meteorology and in some standard atmospheres as the value for 45 latitude even though it applies more precisely to latitude of 453233".nassuming the standardized value for g and ignoring air resistance this means that an object falling freely near the earths surface increases its velocity by 9.80665 m/s 32.1740 ft/s or 22 mph for each second of its descent thus an object starting from rest will attain a velocity of 9.80665 m/s 32.1740 ft/s after one second approximately 19.62 m/s 64.4 ft/s after two seconds and so on adding 9.80665 m/s 32.1740 ft/s to each resulting velocity also again ignoring air resistance any and all objects when dropped from the same height will hit the ground at the same time.naccording to newtons 3rd law the earth itself experiences a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that which it exerts on a falling object this means that the earth also accelerates towards the object until they collide because the mass of the earth is huge however the acceleration imparted to the earth by this opposite force is negligible in comparison to the objects if the object does not bounce after it has collided with the earth each of them then exerts a repulsive contact force on the other which effectively balances the attractive force of gravity and prevents further acceleration.nthe force of gravity on earth is the resultant vector sum of two forces a the gravitational attraction in accordance with newtons universal law of gravitation and b the centrifugal force which results from the choice of an earthbound rotating frame of reference the force of gravity is the weakest at the equator because of the centrifugal force caused by the earths rotation and because points on the equator are furthest from the center of the earth the force of gravity varies with latitude and increases from about 9.780 m/s at the equator to about 9.832 m/s at the poles.nnequations for a falling body near the surface of the earthnmain article equations for a falling bodynunder an assumption of constant gravitational attraction newtons law of universal gravitation simplifies to f mg where m is the mass of the body and g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81 m/s on earth this resulting force is the objects weight the acceleration due to gravity is equal to this g an initially stationary object which is allowed to fall freely under gravity drops a distance which is proportional to the square of the elapsed time the image on the right spanning half a second was captured with a stroboscopic flash at 20 flashes per second during the first of a second the ball drops one unit of distance here a unit is about 12 mm by it has dropped at total of 4 units by 9 units and so on.nunder the same constant gravity assumptions the potential energy e of a body at height h is given by e mgh or e wh with w meaning weight this expression is valid only over small distances h from the surface of the earth similarly the expression for the maximum height reached by a vertically projected body with initial velocity v is useful for small heights and small initial velocities only.nnngravity and astronomyn gravity acts on stars that form the milky way.nthe application of newtons law of gravity has enabled the acquisition of much of the detailed information we have about the planets in the solar system the mass of the sun and details of quasars even the existence of dark matter is inferred using newtons law of gravity although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the sun we know their masses these masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit in space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it planets orbit stars stars orbit galactic centers galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters and clusters orbit in superclusters the force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.nthe earliest gravity possibly in the form of quantum gravity supergravity or a gravitational singularity along with ordinary space and time developed during the planck epoch up to 10 seconds

observatory located in washington us where gravitational waves were first observed in september 2015.nmain article gravitational wavenaccording to general relativity gravitational radiation is generated in situations where the curvature of spacetime is oscillating such as is the case with co-orbiting objects the gravitational radiation emitted by the solar system is far too small to measure however gravitational radiation has been indirectly observed as an energy loss over time in binary pulsar systems such as psr b1913+16 it is believed that neutron star mergers and black hole formation may create detectable amounts of gravitational radiation gravitational radiation observatories such as the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ligo have been created to study the problem in february 2016 the advanced ligo team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole collision on 14 september 2015 ligo registered gravitational waves for the first time as a result of the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion light-years from earth this observation confirms the theoretical predictions of einstein and others that such waves exist the event confirms that binary black holes exist it also opens the way for practical observation and understanding of the nature of gravity and events in the universe including the big bang and what happened after it.nnspeed of gravitynmain article speed of gravitynin december 2012 a research team in china announced that it had produced measurements of the phase lag of earth tides during full and new moons which seem to prove that the speed of gravity is equal to the speed of light this means that if the sun suddenly disappeared the earth would keep orbiting it normally for 8 minutes which is the time light takes to travel that distance the teams findings were released in the chinese science bulletin in february 2013.nin october 2017 the ligo and virgo detectors received gravitational wave signals within 2 seconds of gamma ray satellites and optical telescopes seeing signals from the same direction this confirmed that the speed of gravitational waves was the same as the speed of light.nnanomalies and discrepanciesnthere are some observations that are not adequately accounted for which may point to the need for better theories of gravity or perhaps be explained in other
