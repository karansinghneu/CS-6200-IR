north america are a series of interconnected freshwater lakes primarily in the upper mid-east region of north america on the canadaunited states border which connect to the atlantic ocean through the saint lawrence river they consist of lakes superior michigan huron erie and ontario although hydrologically there are four lakes superior erie ontario and michigan-huron the connected lakes form the great lakes waterway.nthe great lakes are the largest group of freshwater lakes on earth by total area and second-largest by total volume containing 21 of the worlds surface fresh water by volume the total surface is 94,250 square miles 244,106 km and the total volume measured at the low water datum is 5,439 cubic miles 22,671 km slightly less than the volume of lake baikal 5,666 cu mi or 23,615 km 2223 of the worlds surface fresh water due to their sea-like characteristics rolling waves sustained winds strong currents great depths and distant horizons the five great lakes have also long been referred to as inland seas lake superior is the second largest lake in the world by area and the largest freshwater lake by area lake michigan is the largest lake that is entirely within one country.nthe great lakes began to form at the end of the last glacial period around 14,000 years ago as retreating ice sheets exposed the basins they had carved into the land which then filled with meltwater the lakes have been a major source for transportation migration trade and fishing serving as a habitat to a large number of aquatic species in a region with much biodiversity.nthe surrounding region is called the great lakes region which includes the great lakes megalopolis.nncontentsnnngeographyeditn a map of the great lakes basin showing the five sub-basins within left to right they are superior including nipigons basin magenta michigan cyan huron pale green erie yellow ontario light coral.nthough the five lakes lie in separate basins they form a single naturally interconnected body of fresh water within the great lakes basin they form a chain connecting the east-central interior of north america to the atlantic ocean from the interior to the outlet at the saint lawrence river water flows from superior to huron and michigan southward to erie and finally northward to lake ontario the lakes drain a large watershed via many rivers and are studded with approximately 35,000 islands there are also several thousand smaller lakes often called inland lakes within the basin the surface area of the five primary lakes combined is roughly equal to the size of the united kingdom while the surface area of the entire basin the lakes and the land they drain is about the size of the uk and france combined lake michigan is the only one of the great lakes that is entirely within the united states the others form a water boundary between the united states and canada the lakes are divided among the jurisdictions of the canadian province of ontario and the u.s states of michigan wisconsin minnesota illinois indiana ohio pennsylvania and new york both ontario and michigan include in their boundaries portions of four of the lakes ontario does not border lake michigan and michigan does not border lake ontario new york and wisconsins jurisdictions extend into two lakes and each of the remaining states into one of the lakes.nnbathymetryeditnnn system profile of the great lakes.n great lakes bathymetry nas the surfaces of lakes superior huron michigan and erie are all approximately the same elevation above sea level while lake ontario is significantly lower and because the niagara escarpment precludes all natural navigation the four upper lakes are commonly called the upper great lakes this designation however is not universal those living on the shore of lake superior often refer to all the other lakes as the lower lakes because they are farther south sailors of bulk freighters transferring cargoes from lake superior and northern lake michigan and lake huron to ports on lake erie or ontario commonly refer to the latter as the lower lakes and lakes michigan huron and superior as the upper lakes this corresponds to thinking of lakes erie and ontario as down south and the others as up north vessels sailing north on lake michigan are considered upbound even though they are sailing toward its effluent current.nnprimary connecting

niagara peninsula population centers on the peninsulas include grand rapids michigan detroit michigan london ontario hamilton ontario and toronto ontario.nnshipping connection to the oceaneditnthe saint lawrence seaway and great lakes waterway make the great lakes accessible to ocean-going vessels however shifts in shipping to wider ocean-going container shipswhich do not fit through the locks on these routeshave limited container shipping on the lakes most great lakes trade is of bulk material and bulk freighters of seawaymax-size or less can move throughout the entire lakes and out to the atlantic larger ships are confined to working in the lakes themselves only barges can access the illinois waterway system providing access to the gulf of mexico via the mississippi river despite their vast size large sections of the great lakes freeze over in winter interrupting most shipping from january to march some icebreakers ply the lakes keeping the shipping lanes open through other periods of ice on the lakes.nthe great lakes are also connected by the chicago sanitary and ship canal to the gulf of mexico by way of the illinois river from the chicago river and the mississippi river an alternate track is via the illinois river from chicago to the mississippi up the ohio and then through the tennesseetombigbee waterway a combination of a series of rivers and lakes and canals to mobile bay and the gulf of mexico commercial tug-and-barge traffic on these waterways is heavy.npleasure boats can also enter or exit the great lakes by way of the erie canal and hudson river in new york the erie canal connects to the great lakes at the east end of lake erie at buffalo new york and at the south side of lake ontario at oswego new york.nnwater levelseditnin 2009 the lakes contained 84 of the surface freshwater of north america if the water were evenly distributed over the entire continents land area it would reach a depth of 1.5 meters 5 feet the source of water levels in the lakes is tied to what was left by melting glaciers when the lakes took their present form annually only about 1 is new water originating from rivers precipitation and groundwater springs that drain into the lakes historically evaporation has been balanced by drainage making the level of the lakes constant while the lake levels have been preserved intensive human population growth only began in the region in the 20th century and continues today at least two human water use activities have been identified as having the potential to affect the lakes levels diversion the transfer of water to other watersheds and consumption substantially done today by the use of lake water to power and cool electric generation plants resulting in evaporation.nthe water level of lake michiganhuron had remained fairly constant over the 20th century but has nevertheless dropped more than 6 feet from the record high in 1986 to the low of 2013 one newspaper reported that the long-term average level has gone down about 20 inches because of dredging and subsequent erosion in the st clair river lake michiganhuron hit all-time record low levels in 2013 according to the us army corps of engineers the previous record low had been set in 1964 by april 2015 the water level had recovered to 7 inches 17.5 cm more than the long term monthly average".nnname originseditn the great lakes during early springnnstatisticseditnthe great lakes contain 21 of the worlds surface fresh water 5,472 cubic miles 22,810 km or 6.010 u.s gallons that is 6 quadrillion u.s gallons 2.310 liters this is enough water to cover the 48 contiguous u.s states to a uniform depth of 9.5 feet 2.9 m although the lakes contain a large percentage of the worlds fresh water the great lakes supply only a small portion of u.s drinking water on a national basis.nthe total surface area of the lakes is approximately 94,250 square miles 244,100 kmnearly the same size as the united kingdom and larger than the u.s states of new york new jersey connecticut rhode island massachusetts vermont and new hampshire combined.nthe great lakes coast measures approximately 10,500 miles 16,900 km however the length of a coastline is impossible to measure exactly and is not a well-defined measure see coastline paradox of the total 10,500 miles 16,900 km of shoreline canada borders approximately 5,200 miles 8,400 km while the remaining 5,300 miles 8,500 km are bordered by the united states michigan has the longest shoreline of the united states bordering roughly 3,288 miles 5,292 km of shoreline followed by wisconsin 820 miles 1,320 km new york 473 miles 761 km and ohio 312 miles 502 km traversing the shoreline of all the lakes would cover a distance roughly equivalent to travelling half-way around the world at the equator.nngeologyeditn a diagram of the formation of the great lakesn map of glacial lake algonquin and its correlatives usgs 1915nit has been estimated that the foundational geology that created the conditions shaping the present day upper great lakes was laid from 1.1 to 1.2 billion years ago when two previously fused tectonic plates split apart and created the midcontinent rift which crossed the great lakes tectonic zone a valley was formed providing a basin that eventually became modern day lake superior when a second fault line the saint lawrence rift formed approximately 570 million years ago the basis for lakes ontario and erie were created along with what would become the saint lawrence river.nthe great lakes are estimated to have been formed at the end of the last glacial period the wisconsin glaciation ended 10,000 to 12,000 years ago when the laurentide ice sheet receded the retreat of the ice sheet left behind a large amount of meltwater see lake algonquin lake chicago glacial lake iroquois and champlain sea that filled up the basins that the glaciers had carved thus creating the great lakes as we know them today because of the uneven nature of glacier erosion some higher hills became great lakes islands the niagara escarpment follows the contour of the great lakes between new york and wisconsin land below the glaciers rebounded as it was uncovered since the glaciers covered some areas longer than others this glacial rebound occurred at different rates.na notable modern phenomenon is the formation of ice volcanoes over the lakes during wintertime storm-generated waves carve the lakes ice sheet and create conical mounds through the eruption of water and slush the process is only well-documented in the great lakes and has been credited with sparing the southern shorelines from worse rocky erosion.nnclimateeditnthe great lakes have a humid continental climate,nkppen climate classification dfa in southern areas and dfb in northern parts with varying influences from air masses from other regions including dry cold arctic systems mild pacific air masses from the west and warm wet tropical systems from the south and the gulf of mexico the lakes themselves also have a moderating effect on the climate they can also increase precipitation totals and produce lake effect snowfall.nnlake effecteditnmain article lake-effect snown the location of common lake effect bands on the great lakesnthe most well-known winter effect of the great lakes on regional weather is the lake effect in snowfall which is sometimes very localized even late in winter the lakes often have no icepack in the middle the prevailing winds from the west pick up the air and moisture from the lake surface which is slightly warmer in relation to the cold surface winds above as the slightly warmer moist air passes over the colder land surface the moisture often produces concentrated heavy snowfall that sets up in bands or streamers this is similar to the effect of warmer air dropping snow as it passes over mountain ranges during freezing weather with high winds the snow belts receive regular snow fall from this localized weather pattern especially along the eastern shores of the lakes snow belts are found in wisconsin michigan ohio pennsylvania and new york united states and ontario canada.nthe lakes also moderate seasonal temperatures to some degree but not with as large an influence as do large oceans they absorb heat and cool the air in summer then slowly radiate that heat in autumn they protect against frost during transitional weather and keep the summertime temperatures cooler than further inland this effect can be very localized and overridden by offshore wind patterns this temperature buffering produces areas known as fruit belts where fruit can be produced that is typically grown much farther south for instance western michigan has apple and cherry orchards and vineyards cultivated adjacent to the lake shore as far north as the grand traverse bay and nottawasaga bay in central ontario the eastern shore of lake michigan and the southern shore of lake erie have many successful wineries because of the moderating effect as does the niagara peninsula between lake erie and lake ontario a similar phenomenon allows wineries to flourish in the finger lakes region of new york as well as in prince edward county ontario on lake ontarios northeast shore related to the lake effect is the regular occurrence of fog over medium-sized areas particularly along the shorelines of the lakes this is most noticeable along lake superiors shores.nthe great lakes have been observed to help intensify storms such as hurricane hazel in 1954 and the 2011 goderich ontario tornado which moved onshore as a tornadic waterspout in 1996 a rare tropical or subtropical storm was observed forming in lake huron dubbed the 1996 lake huron cyclone rather large severe thunderstorms covering wide areas are well known in the great lakes during mid-summer these mesoscale convective complexes or mccs can cause damage to wide swaths of forest and shatter glass in city buildings these storms mainly occur during the night and the systems sometimes have small embedded tornadoes but more often straight-line winds accompanied by intense lightning.nnecologyeditn generalized schematic of great lakes waterline ecosystemnhistorically the great lakes in addition to their lake ecology were surrounded by various forest ecoregions except in a relatively small area of southeast lake michigan where savanna or prairie occasionally intruded logging urbanization and agriculture uses have changed that relationship in the early 21st century lake superiors shores are 91 forested lake huron 68 lake ontario 49 lake michigan 41 and lake erie where logging and urbanization has been most extensive 21 some of these forests are second or third growth i.e they have been logged before changing their composition at least 13 wildlife species are documented as becoming extinct since the arrival of europeans and many more are threatened or endangered meanwhile exotic and invasive species have also been introduced.nnfaunaeditnsee also category:fauna of the great lakes region north america category:fish of the great lakes and asian carp in north american lake sturgeon the largest native fish in the great lakes and the subject of extensive commercial fishing in the 19th and 20th centuries is listed as a threatened speciesnthe organisms living on the bottom of shallow waters are similar to those found in smaller lakes the deep waters however contain organisms found only in deep cold lakes of the northern latitudes these include the delicate opossum shrimp order mysida the deepwater scud a crustacean of the order amphipoda two types of copepods and the deepwater sculpin a spiny large-headed fish.nthe great lakes are an important source of fishing early european settlers were astounded by both the variety and quantity of fish there were 150 different species in the great lakes throughout history fish populations were the early indicator of the condition of the lakes and have remained one of the key indicators even in the current era of sophisticated analyses and measuring instruments according to the bi-national u.s and canadian resource book the great lakes an environmental atlas and resource book the largest great lakes fish harvests were recorded in 1889 and 1899 at some 67,000 tonnes 66,000 long tons 74,000 short tons 147 million pounds."nby 1801 the new york legislature found it necessary to pass regulations curtailing obstructions to the natural migrations of atlantic salmon from lake erie into their spawning channels in the early 19th century the government of upper canada found it necessary to introduce similar legislation prohibiting the use of weirs and nets at the mouths of lake ontarios tributaries other protective legislation was passed as well but enforcement remained difficult.non both sides of the canadaunited states border the proliferation of dams and impoundments have multiplied necessitating more regulatory efforts concerns by the mid-19th century included obstructions in the rivers which prevented salmon and lake sturgeon from reaching their spawning grounds the wisconsin fisheries commission noted a reduction of roughly 25 in general fish harvests by 1875 the states have removed dams from rivers where necessary.noverfishing has been cited as a possible reason for a decrease in population of various whitefish important because of their culinary desirability and hence economic consequence moreover between 1879 and 1899 reported whitefish harvests declined from some 24.3 million pounds 11 million kg to just over 9 million pounds 4 million kg by 1900 commercial fishermen on lake michigan were hauling in an average of 41 million pounds of fish annually by 1938 wisconsins commercial fishing operations were motorized and mechanized generating jobs for more than 2,000 workers and hauling 14 million pounds per year the population of giant freshwater mussels was eliminated as the mussels were harvested for use as buttons by early great lakes entrepreneurs since 2000 the invasive quagga mussel has smothered the bottom of lake michigan almost from shore to shore and their numbers are estimated at 900 trillion.nthe influx of parasitic lamprey populations after the development of the erie canal and the much later welland canal led to the two federal governments of the us and canada working on joint proposals to control it by the mid-1950s the lake trout populations of lakes michigan and huron were reduced with the lamprey deemed largely to blame this led to the launch of the bi-national great lakes fishery commission.nn cliffs at palisade head on lake superior in minnesota near silver bay.nthe great lakes an environmental atlas and resource book 1972 noted only pockets remain of the once large commercial fishery but water quality improvements realized during the 1970s and 1980s combined with successful salmonid stocking programs have enabled the growth of a large recreational fishery the last commercial fisherman left milwaukee in 2011 because of overfishing and anthropogenic changes to the biosphere.nsince the 19th century an estimated 160 new species have found their way into the great lakes ecosystem many have become invasive the overseas ship ballast and ship hull parasitism are causing severe economic and ecological impacts according to the inland seas education association on average a new species enters the great lakes every eight months.nn a zebra mussel-encrusted vector-averaging current meter from lake michigan.nintroductions into the great lakes include the zebra mussel which was first discovered in 1988 and quagga mussel in 1989 the mollusks are efficient filter feeders competing with native mussels and reducing available food and spawning grounds for fish in addition the mussels may be a nuisance to industries by clogging pipes the u.s fish and wildlife service estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel could be about 5 billion over the next decade.nthe alewife first entered the system west of lake ontario via 19th-century canals by the 1960s the small silver fish had become a familiar nuisance to beach goers across lakes michigan huron and erie periodic mass dieoffs result in vast numbers of the fish washing up on shore estimates by various governments have placed the percentage of lake michigans biomass which was made up of alewives in the early 1960s as high as 90 in the late 1960s the various state and federal governments began stocking several species of salmonids including the native lake trout as well as non-native chinook and coho salmon by the 1980s alewife populations had dropped drastically the ruffe a small percid fish from eurasia became the most abundant fish species in lake superiors saint louis river within five years of its detection in 1986 its range which has expanded to lake huron poses a significant threat to the lower lake fishery five years after first being observed in the st clair river the round goby can now be found in all of the great lakes the goby is considered undesirable for several reasons it preys upon bottom-feeding fish overruns optimal habitat spawns multiple times a season and can survive poor water quality conditions.nseveral species of exotic water fleas have accidentally been introduced into the great lakes such as the spiny waterflea bythotrephes longimanus and the fishhook waterflea cercopagis pengoi potentially having an effect on the zooplankton population several species of crayfish have also been introduced that may contend with native crayfish populations more recently an electric fence has been set up across the chicago sanitary and ship canal in order to keep several species of invasive asian carp out of the area these fast-growing planktivorous fish have heavily colonized the mississippi and illinois river systems the sea lamprey which has been particularly damaging to the native lake trout population is another example of a marine invasive species in the great lakes invasive species particularly zebra and quagga mussels may be at least partially responsible for the collapse of the deepwater demersal fish community in lake huron as well as drastic unprecedented changes in the zooplankton community of the lake.nnfloraeditnnnative habitats and ecoregions in the great lakes region include:nnnplant lists include:nnnloggingnlogging of the extensive forests in the great lakes region removed riparian and adjacent tree cover over rivers and streams which provide shade moderating water temperatures in fish spawning grounds removal of trees also destabilized the soil with greater volumes washed into stream beds causing siltation of gravel beds and more frequent flooding.nrunning cut logs down the tributary rivers into the great lakes also dislocated sediments in 1884 the new york fish commission determined that the dumping of sawmill waste chips and sawdust had impacted fish populations.nnpollutioneditnthe first u.s clean water act passed by a congressional override after being vetoed by us president richard nixon in 1972 was a key piece of legislation along with the bi-national great lakes water quality agreement signed by canada and the u.s a variety of steps taken to process industrial and municipal pollution discharges into the system greatly improved water quality by the 1980s and lake erie in particular is significantly cleaner discharge of toxic substances has been sharply reduced federal and state regulations control substances like pcbs the first of 43 great lakes areas of concern to be formally de-listed due to successful cleanup was ontarios collingwood harbour in 1994 ontarios severn sound followed in 2003 presque isle bay in pennsylvania is formally listed as in recovery as is ontarios spanish harbour dozens of other areas of concern have received partial cleanups such as the rouge river michigan and waukegan harbor illinois.nphosphate detergents were historically a major source of nutrient to the great lakes algae blooms in particular in the warmer and shallower portions of the system such as lake erie saginaw bay green bay and the southernmost portion of lake michigan by the mid-1980s most jurisdictions bordering the great lakes had controlled phosphate detergents resulting in sharp reductions in the frequency and extent of the blooms.nin 2013 news of a garbage patch of plastic pollution in the lakes was reported.nnmercuryeditnuntil 1970 mercury was not listed as a harmful chemical according to the united states federal water quality administration within the past ten years mercury has become more apparent in water tests mercury compounds have been used in paper mills to prevent slime from forming during their production and chemical companies have used mercury to separate chlorine from brine solutions studies conducted by the environmental protection agency have shown that when the mercury comes in contact with many of the bacteria and compounds in the fresh water it forms the compound methyl mercury which has a much greater impact on human health than elemental mercury due to a higher propensity for absorption this form of mercury is not detrimental to a majority of fish types but is very detrimental to people and other wildlife animals who consume the fish mercury has been known for health related problems such as birth defects in humans and animals and the near extinction of eagles in the great lakes region.nnsewageeditnthe amount of raw sewage dumped into the waters was the primary focus of both the first great lakes water quality agreement and federal laws passed in both countries during the 1970s implementation of secondary treatment of municipal sewage by major cities greatly reduced the routine discharge of untreated sewage during the 1970s and 1980s the international joint commission in 2009 summarized the change since the early 1970s the level of treatment to reduce pollution from waste water discharges to the great lakes has improved considerably this is a result of significant expenditures to date on both infrastructure and technology and robust regulatory systems that have proven to be on the whole quite effective the commission reported that all urban sewage treatment systems on the u.s side of the lakes had implemented secondary treatment as had all on the canadian side except for five small systems.nhowever contrary to federal laws in both countries those treatment system upgrades have not yet eliminated combined sewer overflow events this describes when older sewerage systems which combine storm water with sewage into single sewers heading to the treatment plant are temporarily overwhelmed by heavy rainstorms local sewage treatment authorities then must release untreated effluent a mix of rainwater and sewage into local water bodies while enormous public investments such as the deep tunnel projects in chicago and milwaukee have greatly reduced the frequency and volume of these events they have not been eliminated the number of such overflow events in ontario for example is flat according to the international joint commission reports about this issue on the u.s side highlight five large municipal systems those of detroit cleveland buffalo milwaukee and gary as being the largest current periodic sources of untreated discharges into the great lakes.nn different diatom shapes diatoms seen through the microscope these minuscule phytoplankton are encased within a silicate cell wall.nimpacts of climate change on algaeeditnalgae such as diatoms along with other phytoplankton are photosynthetic primary producers supporting the food web of the great lakes the changes in the size or in the function of the primary producers may have a direct or an indirect impact on the food web photosynthesis carried out by diatoms comprises about one fifth of the total photosynthesis by taking co2 out of the water to photosynthesize diatoms help to stabilize the ph of the water as otherwise co2 would react with water making it more acidic diatoms acquire inorganic carbon thought passive diffusion of co2 and hco3 as well they use carbonic anhydrase mediated active transport to speed up this process 1 large diatoms require more carbon uptake than smaller diatoms 8 there is a positive correlation between the surface area and the chlorophyll concentration of diatom cells 2.nnhistoryeditn a woodcut of le griffonnseveral native american tribes inhabited the region since at least 10,000 bc after the end of

a complete disarmament of naval vessels in the great lakes nonetheless both nations maintain coast guard vessels in the great lakes.nduring settlement the great lakes and its rivers were the only practical means of moving people and freight barges from middle north america were able to reach the atlantic ocean from the great lakes when the welland canal opened in 1824 and the later erie canal opened in 1825 by 1848 with the opening of the illinois and michigan canal at chicago direct access to the mississippi river was possible from the lakes with these two canals an all-inland water route was provided between new york city and new orleans.nthe main business of many of the passenger lines in the 19th century was transporting immigrants many of the larger cities owe their existence to their position on the lakes as a freight destination as well as for being a magnet for immigrants after railroads and surface roads developed the freight and passenger businesses dwindled and except for ferries and a few foreign cruise ships has now vanished.nthe immigration routes still have an effect today immigrants often formed their own communities and some areas have a pronounced ethnicity such as dutch german polish finnish and many others since many immigrants settled for a time in new england before moving westward many areas on the u.s side of the great lakes also have a new england feel especially in home styles and accent.nn the eastland leaving chicago c 1909nsince general freight these days is transported by railroads and trucks domestic ships mostly move bulk cargoes such as iron ore coal and limestone for the steel industry the domestic bulk freight developed because of the nearby mines it was more economical to transport the ingredients for steel to centralized plants rather than try to make steel on the spot grain exports are also a major cargo on the lakes.nin the 19th century and early 20th centuries iron and other ores such as copper were shipped south on downbound ships and supplies food and coal were shipped north upbound because of the location of the coal fields in pennsylvania and west virginia and the general northeast track of the appalachian mountains railroads naturally developed shipping routes that went due north to ports such as erie pennsylvania and ashtabula ohio.nbecause the lake maritime community largely developed independently it has some distinctive vocabulary ships no matter the size are called boats when the sailing ships gave way to steamships they were called steamboatsthe same term used on the mississippi the ships

side today the great lakes fleet is much smaller in numbers than it once was because of the increased use of overland freight and a few larger ships replacing many small ones.nduring world war ii the risk of submarine attacks against coastal training facilities motivated the united states navy to operate two aircraft carriers on the great lakes uss sable ix-81 and uss wolverine ix-64 both served as training ships to qualify naval aviators in carrier landing and takeoff lake champlain briefly became the sixth great lake of the united states on march 6 1998 when president clinton signed senate bill 927 this bill which reauthorized the national sea grant program contained a line declaring lake champlain to be a great lake not coincidentally this status allows neighboring states to apply for additional federal research and education funds allocated to these national resources following a small uproar the senate voted to revoke the designation on march 24 although new york and vermont
