program was a series of unmanned space missions by the united states in the 1960s whose objective was to obtain the first close-up images of the surface of the moon the ranger spacecraft were designed to take images of the lunar surface transmitting those images to earth until the spacecraft were destroyed upon impact a series of mishaps however led to the failure of the first six flights at one point the program was called shoot and hope congress launched an investigation into problems of management at nasa headquarters and jet propulsion laboratory after two reorganizations of the agencies ranger 7 successfully returned images in july 1964 followed by two more successful missions.nranger was originally designed beginning in 1959 in three distinct phases called blocks each block had different mission objectives and progressively more advanced system design the jpl mission designers planned multiple launches in each block to maximize the engineering experience and scientific value of the mission and to assure at least one successful flight total research development launch and support costs for the ranger series of spacecraft rangers 1 through 9 was approximately 170 million equivalent to 1.01 billion in 2016.nncontentsnnnranger spacecrafteditn program ranger organization chartneach of the block iii ranger spacecraft had six cameras on board the cameras were fundamentally the same with differences in exposure times fields of view lenses and scan rates the camera system was divided into two channels p partial and f full each channel was self-contained with separate power supplies timers and transmitters the f-channel had two cameras the wide-angle a-camera and the narrow angle b-camera the p-channel had four cameras p1 and p2 narrow angle and p3 and p4 wide angle the final f-channel image was taken between 2.5 and 5 seconds before impact altitude about 5 km and the last p-channel image 0.2 to 0.4 seconds before impact altitude about 600 m the images provided better resolution than was available from earth-based views by a factor of 1000 the design and construction of the cameras was led by leonard r malling.nnnnthe ranger program manager for the first six spacecraft was james d burke.nnmission listeditnblock 1 missionseditn ranger block i spacecraft diagram nasannblock 1 consisting of two spacecraft launched into earth orbit in 1961 was intended to test the atlas-agena launch vehicle and spacecraft equipment without attempting to reach the moon.nproblems with the early version of the launch vehicle left ranger 1 and ranger 2 in short-lived low-earth orbits in which the spacecraft could not stabilize themselves collect solar power or survive for long in 1962 jpl utilized the ranger 1 and ranger 2 design for the failed mariner 1 and successful mariner 2 deep-space probes to venus.nnblock 2 missionseditn ranger block ii spacecraft diagram nasannblock 2 of the ranger project launched three spacecraft to the moon in 1962 carrying a tv camera a radiation detector and a seismometer in a separate capsule slowed by a rocket motor and packaged to survive its low-speed impact on the moons surface the three missions together demonstrated good performance of the atlas/agena b launch vehicle and the adequacy of the spacecraft design but unfortunately not both on the same attempt ranger 3 had problems with both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft missed the moon by about 36,800 km and has orbited the sun ever since ranger 4 had a perfect launch but the spacecraft was completely disabled the project team tracked the seismometer capsule to impact just out of sight on the lunar far side validating the communications and navigation system ranger 5 missed the moon and was disabled no significant science information was gleaned from these missions the craft weighed 331 kg.naround the end of block 2 it was discovered that a type of diode used in previous missions produced problematic gold-plate flaking in the conditions of space this may have been responsible for some of the failures.nnblock 3 missionseditn ranger block iii spacecraft diagram nasannrangers block 3 embodied four launches in 1964-65 these spacecraft boasted a television instrument designed to observe the lunar surface during the approach as the spacecraft neared the moon they would reveal detail smaller than the best earth telescopes could show and finally details down to dishpan size the first of the new series ranger 6 had a flawless flight except that the television system was disabled by an in-flight accident and could take no pictures.nthe next three rangers with a redesigned television were completely successful ranger 7 photographed its way down to target in a lunar plain soon named mare cognitum south of the crater copernicus it sent more than 4,300 pictures from six cameras to waiting scientists and engineers the new images revealed that craters caused by impact were the dominant features of the moons surface even in the seemingly smooth and empty plains great craters were marked by small ones and the small with tiny impact pockmarks as far down in size as could be discernedabout 50 centimeters 20 inches the light-colored streaks radiating from copernicus and a few other large craters turned out to be chains and nets of small craters and debris blasted out in the primary impacts.nin february 1965 ranger 8 swept an oblique course over the south of oceanus procellarum and mare nubium to crash in mare tranquillitatis about 70 kilometers 43 mi distant from where apollo 11 would land 4 years later it garnered more than 7,000 images covering a wider area and reinforcing the conclusions from ranger 7 about a month later ranger 9 came down in the 90 kilometers 56 miles diameter crater alphonsus its 5,800 images nested concentrically and taking advantage of very low-level sunlight provided strong confirmation of the crater-on-crater gently rolling contours of the lunar surface.nnsee
