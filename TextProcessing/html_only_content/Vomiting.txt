stomach contents typically via the mouthnnnvomiting is the involuntary forceful expulsion of the contents of ones stomach through the mouth and sometimes the nose.nvomiting can be caused by a wide variety of conditions it may present as a specific response to ailments like gastritis or poisoning or as a non-specific sequela of disorders ranging from brain tumors and elevated intracranial pressure to overexposure to ionizing radiation the feeling that one is about to vomit is called nausea which often precedes but does not always lead to vomiting antiemetics are sometimes necessary to suppress nausea and vomiting in severe cases where dehydration develops intravenous fluid may be required self-induced vomiting can be a component of an eating disorder such as bulimia nervosa and is itself now an eating disorder on its own purging disorder.nvomiting is different from regurgitation although the two terms are often used interchangeably regurgitation is the return of undigested food back up the esophagus to the mouth without the force and displeasure associated with vomiting the causes of vomiting and regurgitation are generally different.nncontentsnnncomplicationsnaspirationnvomiting can be dangerous if the gastric content enters the respiratory tract under normal circumstances the gag reflex and coughing prevent this from occurring however these protective reflexes are compromised in persons under the influences of certain substances such as alcohol or anesthesia the individual may choke and asphyxiate or suffer an aspiration pneumonia.nndehydration and electrolyte imbalancenprolonged and excessive vomiting depletes the body of water dehydration and may alter the electrolyte status gastric vomiting leads to the loss of acid protons and chloride directly combined with the resulting alkaline tide this leads to hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis low chloride levels together with high hco and co and increased blood ph and often hypokalemia potassium depletion the hypokalemia is an indirect result of the kidney compensating for the loss of acid with the loss of intake of food the individual may eventually become cachectic a less frequent occurrence results from a vomiting of intestinal contents including bile acids and hco which can cause metabolic acidosis.nnmalloryweiss tearnsee also malloryweiss

coordinated contractions together with the diaphragm and the muscles used in respiratory inspiration for this reason an individual may confuse this phase with an episode of violent hiccups in this retching phase nothing has yet been expelled in the next phase also termed the expulsive phase intense pressure is formed in the stomach brought about by enormous shifts in both the diaphragm and the abdomen these shifts are in essence vigorous contractions of these muscles that last for extended periods of time much longer than a normal period of muscular contraction the pressure is then suddenly released when the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes resulting in the expulsion of gastric contents individuals who do not regularly exercise their abdominal muscles may experience pain in those muscles for a few days the relief of pressure and the release of endorphins into the bloodstream after the expulsion causes the vomiter to feel better.nncontentsngastric secretions and likewise vomit
