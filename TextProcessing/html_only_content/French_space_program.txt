french space program wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnthe french space program includes both civil and military spaceflight activities it is the 3rd oldest institutional space program in history along with the ussr and the us and the largest space program in europe.nncontentsnnnbackgroundeditn space rocket imagined on a gobelins tapestry ordered by colbert and drawn by le brun 1664.nspace travel has long been a significant ambition in french culture from the gobelins 1664 tapestry representing a space rocket to jules vernes 1865 novel de la terre la lune and george mlis 1902 movie voyage dans la lune space and rocketry were present in french society long before the technological means appeared to allow the development of a space exploration program.nduring the late 18th century jean-franois piltre de rozier jacques charles and the montgolfier brothers are seen as worldwide precursors and explorers of aeronautics with the world record altitude then reached by a human at 7,016 metres 23,018 ft performed by joseph-louis gay-lussac in 1804 those names their numerous students and their works will mark the early expertise of frances space program in all types of air balloons since.nn french postal stamp honouring robert esnault-pelterie 1967.nin the beginning of the twentieth century the origins of the french space program are tied to french technological developments in aerospace and astronautics notably the nascent airplane and rocket industries.nn ea-eole rockets as tested in 19401941 and 1951nrobert esnault-pelterie appears as one of the early pioneers in space exploration design and rocket science from 1908 he studied propulsion and space flight without knowing the work of russian mathematician konstantin tsiolkovsky at that time he derived the mathematical equations for interplanetary flight flight durations and engine propulsion and was later nominated president of the chambre syndicale des industries aronautiques trade association of aircraft industries in 1912 from 1935 to 1939 he designed a high-altitude sounding rocket but world war ii interrupted his plans german experts believed that the rocket could have reached its design goal of 60 miles 97 km esnault-pelterie convinced physicist jean-jacques barr a pioneer in rocket propulsion to collaborate on the design of a self-propelled cryogenic rocket.nbetween 1927 and 1933 barr did extensive research and developed a rocket that could reach the upper atmosphere and space the ea-41 eole see picture.nnhistoryeditnthe beginning of the institutional french space program dates back to 1946 when right after world war ii the laboratoire de recherches balistiques et arodynamiques fr lrba was created in vernon to develop the next generation of rockets partly taking advantage of the german development of the v2 rocket.nbefore this and during the war as free france continued to function the ea-41 was tested and improved by military personnel from october 1942 through to 1945.n22 may 1952 vronique n1 is successfully launched from the saharan desert.nin 1958 president charles de gaulle directed the creation of several space research committees in 1959 the comit dtudes spatiales was born under the supervision of pierre auger.nin 1961 de gaulle signed the creation of the centre national d etudes spatiales cnes to coordinate french space activities development of western europes first carrier rocket the diamant began in 1962 first launched in algeria.nnovember 26 1965 at 15h 47mn and 21s asterix the first french satellite in space is successfully launched by a diamant rocket from the algerian desert it is active for 2 consecutive days before ceasing to transmit.nin 1965 frances space launch pads and cnes settled in kourou.nin 1973 france impulsed the creation of the european space agency and became its first contributor.nthe french space budget although stagnant since the early 2000s in constant euros remains in absolute terms the largest of the member countries of the european space agency esa and the second largest national budget after the united states of america at 2,33 billion in 2004 this budget stood at 1.698 billion euros with 685 million being transferred to the paris-based esa for the programs conducted under its supervision.nn ariane rocket at bourget airport museum parisnthe ariane rocket family is frances own launcher family which use has been extended to the whole of esas member countries.nits spaceport near kourou was selected in 1964 to host all of frances launches later it was selected as esas launch site before being in french guiana frances space launches were made from algeria in colomb-bchar and hammaguir.nthe french space program thus benefits from the best ground position for launch sites on earth as its position 5.3 north of the equator allows rockets to gain propulsion from the spinning of the earth when launched eastward 460 m/s and save on propellant no other governmental launch sites allow this level of physical parameters it is also able to launch satellites into polar orbits from this spaceport.nnlaunch statisticseditnas of 2017 kourou counts amongst the spaceports with the highest percentage of successful launches both successive and overall here is a chronology of all orbital launches from the kourou spaceport since 1970
