historian the capital city was moved six times the final and most important move was to yin in 1350 bc which led to the dynastys golden age the term yin dynasty has been synonymous with the shang dynasty in history although it has lately been used to refer specifically to the latter half of the shang dynasty.nchinese historians in later periods were accustomed to the notion of one dynasty succeeding another but the political situation in early china was much more complicated hence as some scholars of china suggest the xia and the shang can refer to political entities that existed concurrently just as the early zhou existed at the same time as the shang.nalthough written records found at anyang confirm the existence of the shang dynasty western scholars are often hesitant to associate settlements that are contemporaneous with the anyang settlement with the shang dynasty for example archaeological findings at sanxingdui suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike anyang the evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the shang realm extended from anyang the leading hypothesis is that anyang ruled by the same shang in the official history coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as china proper.nnzhou dynasty 1046256 bcnmain articles zhou dynasty and iron age chinanzhou

valley overrunning the territory of the shang the zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a semi-feudal system the zhou lived west of the shang and the zhou leader was appointed western protector by the shang the ruler of the zhou king wu with the assistance of his brother the duke of zhou as regent managed to defeat the shang at the battle of muye.nthe king of zhou at this time invoked the concept of the mandate of heaven to legitimize his rule a concept that was influential for almost every succeeding dynasty like shangdi heaven tian ruled over all the other gods and it decided who would rule china it was believed that a ruler lost the mandate of heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number and when more realistically the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people in response the royal house would be overthrown and a new house would rule having been granted the mandate of heaven.nthe zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern xian

period is marked by a falling apart of the central zhou power in each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the zhou kings in name only some local leaders even started using royal titles for themselves china now consisted of hundreds of states some of them only as large as a village with a fort.nas the

principalities dominated china some southern states such as chu and wu claimed independence from the zhou who undertook wars against some of them wu and yue many new cities were established in this period and chinese culture was slowly shaped.nonce all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominions the bloodshed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the warring states period which began when the three remaining lite families in the jin state zhao wei and han partitioned the state many famous individuals such as laozi confucius and sun tzu

including areas of modern sichuan and liaoning were annexed they were governed under the new local administrative system of commandery and prefecture this system had been in use since the spring and

legalism that guided the qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor this philosophy while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion proved unworkable for governing it in peacetime the qin emperor presided over the brutal silencing of political opposition including the event known as the burning of books and burying of scholars this would

land tax the central imperial government relied heavily on salt monopoly externally former submissive states raided the empire and the vast border territories were irreversibly lost for subsequent centuries nevertheless civil society recovered and thrived amidst the weakened imperial bureaucracy.nin late tang period the empire was worn out by recurring revolts of regional warlords while internally as scholar-officials engaged in fierce factional strife corrupted eunuchs amassed immense power catastrophically the huang chao rebellion from 874 to 884 devastated the entire empire for a decade the sack of the southern port guangzhou in 879 was followed by the massacre of most of its inhabitants along with the large foreign merchant enclaves by 881 both capitals luoyang and changan fell successively the reliance on ethnic han and turkic warlords in suppressing the rebellion increased their power and influence consequently the fall of the dynasty following zhu wens usurpation led

in the early song period which all ended in failure then in 1004 the liao cavalry swept over the exposed north china plain and reached the outskirts of kaifeng forcing the songs submission and then agreement to the chanyuan treaty which imposed heavy annual tributes from the song treasury the treaty was a significant reversal of chinese dominance of the traditional tributary system yet the annual outflow of songs silver to the liao was paid back through the purchase of chinese goods and products which expanded the song economy and replenished its treasury this dampened the incentive for the song to further campaign against the liao meanwhile this cross-border trade and contact induced further sinicization within the liao empire at the expense of its military might which was derived from its primitive nomadic lifestyle similar treaties and social-economical consequences occurred in songs relations with the jin dynasty.nnliaodi pagoda song dynastythe pagoda of tianing temple liao

classical chinese civilization the song economy facilitated by technology advancement had reached a level of sophistication probably unseen in world history before its time the population soared to over 100 million and the living standards of common people improved tremendously due to improvements in rice cultivation and the wide availability of coal for production the capital cities of kaifeng and subsequently hangzhou were both the most populous cities in the world for their time and encouraged vibrant civil societies unmatched by previous chinese dynasties although land trading routes to the far west were blocked by nomadic empires there were extensive maritime trade with neighbouring states which facilitated the use of song coinage as the de facto currency of exchange giant wooden vessels equipped with compasses travelled throughout the china seas and northern indian ocean the concept of insurance was practised by merchants to hedge the risks of such long-haul maritime shipments with prosperous economic activities the historically first use of paper currency emerged in the western city of chengdu as a supplement to the existing copper coins.nthe song dynasty was

movable-type printing further facilitated the spread of knowledge culture and the arts flourished with grandiose artworks such as along the river during the qingming festival and eighteen songs of a nomad flute along with great buddhist painters such as the prolific lin tinggui.nthe song dynasty was also a period of major innovation in the history of warfare gunpowder while invented in the tang dynasty was first put into use in battlefields by the song army inspiring a succession of new firearms and siege engines designs during the southern song dynasty as its survival hinged decisively on

first conquest dynasty in chinese history to rule the entire china proper and its population as an ethnic minority the dynasty also directly controlled the mongolian heartland and other regions inheriting the largest share of territory of the divided mongol empire which roughly coincided with the modern area of china and nearby regions in east asia further expansion of the empire was halted after defeats in the invasions of japan and vietnam following the previous jin dynasty the capital of yuan dynasty was established at khanbaliq also known as dadu modern-day beijing the grand canal

drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than an actual decrease others such as timothy brook argue that the mongols created a system of enserfment among a huge portion of the chinese populace causing many to disappear from the census altogether other historians including william mcneill and david morgan consider that plague was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period in the 14th century china suffered additional depredations from epidemics of plague estimated to have killed 25 million people 30 of the population of china.nthroughout the yuan dynasty there was some general sentiment among the populace against the mongol dominance yet rather than the nationalist cause it was mainly strings of natural disasters and incompetent

neo-feudal landholdings of the song and mongol periods were expropriated by the ming rulers land estates were confiscated by the government fragmented and rented out private slavery was forbidden consequently after the death of the yongle emperor independent peasant landholders predominated in chinese agriculture these laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes towards later era of the ming dynasty with declining government control commerce trade and private industries revived.nthe dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire the emperors role became more autocratic although hongwu emperor necessarily continued to use what he called the grand secretariat to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy including memorials petitions and recommendations to the throne imperial edicts in reply reports of various kinds and tax records it was this same bureaucracy that later
