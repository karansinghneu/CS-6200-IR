airglow wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnn airglow over the vlt platformnairglow also called nightglow is a faint emission of light by a planetary atmosphere in the case of earths atmosphere this optical phenomenon causes the night sky to never be completely dark even after the effects of starlight and diffused sunlight from the far side are removed.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditn airglow in allier france on the night of 13 august 2015nthe airglow phenomenon was first identified in 1868 by swedish physicist anders ngstrm since then it has been studied in the laboratory and various chemical reactions have been observed to emit electromagnetic energy as part of the process scientists have identified some of those processes that would be present in earths atmosphere and astronomers have verified that such emissions are present.nndescriptioneditn comet lovejoy passing behind earths airglow on december 22 2011 captured from the issnairglow is caused by various processes in the upper atmosphere of earth such as the recombination of atoms which were photoionized by the sun during the day luminescence caused by cosmic rays striking the upper atmosphere and chemiluminescence caused mainly by oxygen and nitrogen reacting with hydroxyl free radicals at heights of a few hundred kilometres it is not noticeable during the daytime due to the glare and scattering of sunlight.neven at the best ground-based observatories airglow limits the photosensitivity of optical telescopes partly for this reason space telescopes like hubble can observe much fainter objects than current ground-based telescopes at visible wavelengths.nairglow at night may be bright enough for a ground observer to notice and appears generally bluish although airglow emission is fairly uniform across the atmosphere it appears brightest at about 10 above the observers horizon since the lower one looks the greater the depth of atmosphere one is looking through very low down however atmospheric extinction reduces the apparent brightness of the airglow.none airglow mechanism is when an atom of nitrogen combines with an atom of oxygen to form a molecule of nitric oxide no in the process a photon is emitted this photon may have any of several different wavelengths characteristic of nitric oxide molecules the free atoms are available for this process because molecules of nitrogen n and oxygen o are dissociated by solar energy in the upper reaches of the atmosphere and may encounter each other to form no other species that can create air glow in the atmosphere are hydroxyl oh atomic oxygen o sodium na and lithium li.nnfurther information sodium layernthe sky brightness is typically measured in units of apparent magnitude per square arcsecond of sky.nncalculation of the effects of airgloweditn the airglow above the horizon captured from the iss.nplay media airglow.n two images of the sky over the haarp gakona facility using the nrl-cooled ccd imager at 557.7 nm the field of view is approximately 38 the left-hand image shows the background star field with the hf transmitter off the right-hand image was taken 63 seconds later with the hf transmitter on structure is evident in the emission region.nsee also apparent magnitudenin order to calculate the relative intensity of airglow we need to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes of photons this clearly depends on the spectrum of the source but we will ignore that initially at visible wavelengths we need the parameter sv the power per square centimetre of aperture and per micrometre of wavelength produced by a zeroth-magnitude star to convert apparent magnitudes into fluxes sv 69884000000000000004.010 w cm m if we take the example of a v28 star observed through a normal v band filter b 69932000000000000000.2 m bandpass frequency 7014600000000000000610 hz the number of photons we receive per square centimeter of telescope aperture per second from the source is n:nnnwhere h is plancks constant h is the energy of a single photon of frequency nat v band the emission from airglow is v 22 per square arc-second at a high-altitude observatory on a moonless night in excellent seeing conditions the image of a star will be about 0.7 arc-second across with an area of 0.4 square arc-second and so the emission from airglow over the area of the image corresponds to about v 23 this gives the number of photons from airglow n:nnnthe signal-to-noise for an ideal ground-based observation with a telescope of area a ignoring losses and detector noise arising from poisson statistics is only:nnnif we assume a 10 m diameter ideal ground-based telescope and an unresolved star every second over a patch the size of the seeing-enlarged image of the star 35 photons arrive from the star and 3500 from air-glow so over an hour roughly 70071300000000000001.310 arrive from the air-glow and approximately 70051300000000000001.310 arrive from the source so the s/n ratio is about:nnnwe can compare this with real answers from exposure time calculators for an 8 m unit very large telescope telescope according to the fors exposure time calculator you need 40 hours of observing time to reach v 28 while the 2.4 m hubble only takes 4 hours according to the acs exposure time calculator a hypothetical 8 m hubble telescope would take about 30 minutes.nit should be clear from this calculation that reducing the view field size can make fainter objects more detectable against the airglow unfortunately adaptive optics techniques that reduce the diameter of the view field of an earth-based telescope by an order of magnitude only as yet work in the infrared where the sky is much brighter a space telescope isnt restricted by the view field since they are not affected by airglow.nninduced airgloweditn swisscube-1s first airglow image of the earth shifted to green from near ir captured on march 3 2011.nscientific experiments have been conducted to induce airglow by directing high-power radio emissions at the earths ionosphere these radiowaves interact with the ionosphere to induce faint but visible optical light at specific wavelengths under certain conditions.nnexperimental observationeditnswisscube-1 is a swiss satellite operated by ecole polytechnique fdrale de lausanne the spacecraft is a single unit cubesat which was designed to conduct research into airglow within the earths atmosphere and to develop technology for future spacecraft though swisscube-1 is rather small 10 x 10 x 10 cm and weighs less than 1 kg it carries a small telescope for obtaining images of the airglow the first swisscube-1 image came down on february 18 2011 and was quite black with some thermal noise on it the first airglow image came down on march 3 2011 this image has been converted to the human optical range green from its near-infrared measurement this image provides a measurement of the intensity of the airglow phenomenon in the near-infrared the range measured is from 500 to 61400 photons with a resolution of 500 photons.nnobservation of airglow on other planetseditnthe venus express spacecraft contains an infrared sensor which has detected near-ir emissions from the upper atmosphere of venus the emissions come from nitric oxide no and from molecular oxygen.nscientists had previously determined in laboratory testing that during no production ultraviolet emissions and near-ir emissions were produced the uv radiation has been detected in the atmosphere but until this mission the atmosphere-produced near-ir emissions were only theoretical.nngalleryeditnnsee alsoeditnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
