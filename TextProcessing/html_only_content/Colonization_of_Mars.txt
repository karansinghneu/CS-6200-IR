an artists conception of a human mars base with a cutaway revealing an interior horticultural areanmars is the focus of much scientific study about possible human colonization marss surface conditions and past presence of water make it arguably the most hospitable planet in the solar system besides earth mars requires less energy per unit mass delta-v to reach from earth than any planet other than venus.npermanent human habitation on other planets including mars is one of science fictions most prevalent themes as technology advances and concerns about humanitys future on earth increase arguments favoring space colonization gain momentum other reasons for colonizing space include economic interests long-term scientific research best carried out by humans as opposed to robotic probes and sheer curiosity.nboth private and public organizations have made commitments to researching the viability of long-term colonization efforts and to taking steps toward a permanent human presence on mars space agencies engaged in research or mission planning include nasa roscosmos and the china national space administration private organizations include spacex lockheed martin and boeing.nncontentsnnnmission concepts and timelineseditn various components of a human mars surface missionnall of the early human mission concepts to mars as conceived by national governmental space programssuch as those being tentatively planned by nasa rocosmos and esawould not be direct precursors to colonization they are intended solely as exploration missions as the apollo missions to the moon were not planned to be sites of a permanent base.ncolonization requires the establishment of permanent habitats that have potential for self-expansion and self-sustenance two early proposals for building habitats on mars are the mars direct and the semi-direct concepts advocated by robert zubrin.nnspacex expedition baseeditnmain article bfr rocket mars propellant plant and basenas of 2018 spacex is funding and developing a series of mars-bound cargo flights with the bfr rocket and spaceship system as early as 2022 followed by the first crewed flight to mars on the next launch window in 2024 during the first phase the goal will be to launch several bfrs to transport and assemble a methane/oxygen propellant plant and to build up a base in preparation for an expanded surface presence a successful colonization would ultimately involve many more economic factorswhether individuals companies or governmentsto facilitate the growth of the human presence on mars over many decades.nnrelative similarity to eartheditnnearth is similar to venus in bulk composition size and surface gravity but marss similarities to earth are more compelling when considering colonization these include:nnndifferences from eartheditnnnconditions for human habitationeditn expedition style crewed mission would operate on the surface but for limited amounts of timen dust is one concern for mars missionsnconditions on the surface of mars are closer to the conditions on earth in terms of temperature and sunlight than on any other planet or moon except for the cloud tops of venus however the surface is not hospitable to humans or most known life forms due to the radiation greatly reduced air pressure and an atmosphere with only 0.1 oxygen.nin 2012 it was reported that some lichen and cyanobacteria survived and showed remarkable adaptation capacity for photosynthesis after 34 days in simulated martian conditions in the mars simulation laboratory msl maintained by the german aerospace center dlr some scientists think that cyanobacteria could play a role in the development of self-sustainable crewed outposts on mars they propose that cyanobacteria could be used directly for various applications including the production of food fuel and oxygen but also indirectly products from their culture could support the growth of other organisms opening the way to a wide range of life-support biological processes based on martian resources.nhumans have explored parts of earth that match some conditions on mars based on nasa rover data temperatures on mars at low latitudes are similar to those in antarctica the atmospheric pressure at the highest altitudes reached by piloted balloon ascents 35 km 114,000 feet in 1961 38 km in 2012 is similar to that on the surface of mars however the pilots were not exposed to the extremely low pressure as it would have killed them but seated in a pressurized capsule.nhuman survival on mars would require living in artificial mars habitats with complex life-support systems one key aspect of this would be water processing systems being made mainly of water a human being would die in a matter of days without it even a 58 decrease in total body water causes fatigue and dizziness and a 10 decrease physical and mental impairment see dehydration a person on earth uses 70140 litres of water per day on average through experience and training astronauts on the iss have shown it is possible to use far less and that around 70 of what is used can be recycled using the iss water recovery systems similar systems would be needed on mars but would need to be much more efficient since regular robotic deliveries of water to mars would be prohibitively expensive the iss is supplied with water four times per year some experts have argued for setting up open-air settlements by using special construction methodologies like excavating deep into the martian crust to depths where air pressures may be sufficient to allow humans to survive without pressurized suits.potential access to in-situ water frozen or otherwise via drilling has been investigated by nasa.nneffects on human healtheditnmars presents a hostile environment for human habitation different technologies have been developed to assist long-term space exploration and may be adapted for habitation on mars the existing record for the longest consecutive space flight is 438 days by cosmonaut valeri polyakov and the most accrued time in space is 878 days by gennady padalka the longest time spent outside the protection of the earths van allen radiation belt is about 12 days for the apollo 17 moon landing this is minor in comparison to the 1100-day journey planned by nasa as soon as the year 2028 scientists have also hypothesized that many different biological functions can be negatively affected by the environment of mars colonies due to higher levels of radiation there are a multitude of physical side-effects that must be mitigated in addition martian soil contains high levels of toxins which are hazardous to human health.nnphysical effectseditnthe difference in gravity would negatively affect human health by weakening bones and muscles there is also risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular problems current rotations on the international space station put astronauts in zero gravity for six months a comparable length of time to a one-way trip to mars this gives researchers the ability to better understand the physical state that astronauts going to mars would arrive in once on mars surface gravity is only 38 of that on earth upon return to earth recovery from bone loss and atrophy is a long process and the effects of microgravity may never fully reverse.nthere are also severe radiation risks on mars that can influence cognitive processes deteriorate cardiovascular health inhibit reproduction and cause cancer.nnpsychological effectseditndue to the communication delays new protocols need to be developed in order to assess crew members psychological health researchers have developed a martian simulation called hi-seas hawaii space exploration analog and simulation that places scientists in a simulated martian laboratory to study the psychological effects of isolation repetitive tasks and living in close-quarters with other scientists for up to a year at a time computer programs are being developed to assist crews with personal and interpersonal issues in absence of direct communication with professionals on earth current suggestions for mars exploration and colonization are to select individuals who have passed psychological screenings psychosocial sessions for the return home are also suggested in order to reorient people to society.nnterraformingeditn artists conception of the process of terraforming mars as discussed in some works of science fictionnmain article terraforming of marsnvarious works of fiction put forward the idea of terraforming mars to allow a wide variety of life forms including humans to survive unaided on marss surface some ideas of possible technologies that may be able to contribute to the actual terraforming of mars have been conjectured but none would be able to bring the entire planet into the earth-like habitat pictured in science fiction.nnradiationeditnfurther information health threat from cosmic rays and effect of spaceflight on the human bodynmars has no global magnetosphere as earth does combined with a thin atmosphere this permits a significant amount of ionizing radiation to reach the martian surface the mars odyssey spacecraft carries an instrument the mars radiation environment experiment marie to measure the radiation marie found that radiation levels in orbit above mars are 2.5 times higher than at the international space station the average daily dose was about 220 gy 22 mrad equivalent to 0.08 gy per year a three-year exposure to such levels would be close to the safety limits currently adopted by nasa.nlevels at the martian surface would be somewhat lower and might vary significantly at different locations depending on altitude and local magnetic fields building living quarters underground possibly in martian lava tubes which are already present would significantly lower the colonists exposure to radiation occasional solar proton events spes produce much higher doses.nn comparison of radiation doses includes the amount detected on the trip from earth to mars by the rad on the msl 20112013.nmuch remains to be learned about space radiation in 2003 nasas lyndon b johnson space center opened a facility the nasa space radiation laboratory at brookhaven national laboratory that employs particle accelerators to simulate space radiation the facility studies its effects on living organisms as well as experimenting with shielding techniques initially there was some evidence that this kind of low level chronic radiation is not quite as dangerous as once thought and that radiation hormesis occurs however results from a 2006 study indicated that protons from cosmic radiation may cause twice as much serious damage to dna as previously estimated exposing astronauts to greater risk of cancer and other diseases as a result of the higher radiation in the martian environment the summary report of the review of u.s human space flight plans committee released in 2009 reported that mars is not an easy place to visit with existing technology and without a substantial investment of resources nasa is exploring a variety of alternative techniques and technologies such as deflector shields of plasma to protect astronauts and spacecraft from radiation.nin september 2017 nasa reported radiation levels on the surface of the planet mars were temporarily doubled and were associated with an aurora 25-times brighter than any observed earlier due to a massive and unexpected solar storm in the middle of the month.nntransportationeditninterplanetary spaceflighteditn rendezvous an interplanetary stage and lander stage come together over marsn mars viking 1 1980nmars requires less energy per unit mass delta v to reach from earth than any planet except venus using a hohmann transfer orbit a trip to mars requires approximately nine months in space modified transfer trajectories that cut the travel time down to four to seven months in space are possible with incrementally higher amounts of energy and fuel compared to a hohmann transfer orbit and are in standard use for robotic mars missions shortening the travel time below about six months requires higher delta-v and an exponentially increasing amount of fuel and is difficult with chemical rockets it could be feasible with advanced spacecraft propulsion technologies some of which have already been tested to varying levels such as variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rocket and nuclear rockets in the former case a trip time of forty days could be attainable and in the latter a trip time down to about two weeks in 2016 a university of california scientist said they could further reduce travel time for an robotic probe to mars down to as little as 72 hours with the use of a photonic propulsion system instead of the fuel-based rocket propulsion system.nduring the journey the astronauts would be subject to radiation which would require a means to protect them cosmic radiation and solar wind cause dna damage which increases the risk of cancer significantly the effect of long-term travel in interplanetary space is unknown but scientists estimate an added risk of between 1 and 19 one estimate is 3.4 for men to die of cancer because of the radiation during the journey to mars and back to earth for women the probability is higher due to generally larger glandular tissues.nnlanding on marseditn painting of a landing on mars 1986nmars has a surface gravity 0.38 times that of earth and the density of its atmosphere is about 0.6 of that on earth the relatively strong gravity and the presence of aerodynamic effects make it difficult to land heavy crewed spacecraft with thrusters only as was done with the apollo moon landings yet the atmosphere is too thin for aerodynamic effects to be of much help in aerobraking and landing a large vehicle landing piloted missions on mars would require braking and landing systems different from anything used to land crewed spacecraft on the moon or robotic missions on mars.nif one assumes carbon nanotube construction material will be available with a strength of 130 gpa then a space elevator could be built to land people and material on mars.na space elevator on phobos a mars moon has also been proposed.nnequipment needed for colonizationeditncolonization of mars would require a wide variety of equipmentboth equipment to directly provide services to humans and production equipment used to produce food propellant water energy and breathable oxygenin order to support human colonization efforts required equipment will include:nnn mars greenhouses feature in many colonization designs especially for food production and other purposesn various technologies and devices for mars are shown in the illustration of a mars basennaccording to elon musk even at a million people working on mars youre assuming an incredible amount of productivity per person because you would need to recreate the entire industrial base on mars you would need to mine and refine all of these different materials in a much more difficult environment than earth".nnbasic utilitieseditnin order to function at all the colony would need the basic utilities to support human civilization these would need to be designed to handle the harsh martian environment and would either have to be serviceable whilst wearing an eva suit or housed inside a human habitable environment for example if electricity generation systems rely on solar power large energy storage facilities will also be needed to cover the periods when dust storms block out the sun and automatic dust removal systems may be needed to avoid human exposure to conditions on the surface if the colony is to scale beyond a few people systems will also need to maximise use of local resources to reduce the need for resupply from earth for example by recycling water and oxygen and being adapted to be able to use any water found on mars whatever form it is in.nncommunication with eartheditncommunications with earth are relatively straightforward during the half-sol when earth is above the martian horizon nasa and esa included communications relay equipment in several of the mars orbiters so mars already has communications satellites while these will eventually wear out additional orbiters with communication relay capability are likely to be launched before any colonization expeditions are mounted.nthe one-way communication delay due to the speed of light ranges from about 3 minutes at closest approach approximated by perihelion of mars minus aphelion of earth to 22 minutes at the largest possible superior conjunction approximated by aphelion of mars plus aphelion of earth real-time communication such as telephone conversations or internet relay chat between earth and mars would be highly impractical due to the long time lags involved nasa has found that direct communication can be blocked for about two weeks every synodic period around the time of superior conjunction when the sun is directly between mars and earth although the actual duration of the communications blackout varies from mission to mission depending on various factorssuch as the amount of link margin designed into the communications system and the minimum data rate that is acceptable from a mission standpoint in reality most missions at mars have had communications blackout periods of the order of a month.na satellite at the l or l earthsun lagrangian point could serve as a relay during this period to solve the problem even a constellation of communications satellites would be a minor expense in the context of a full colonization program however the size and power of the equipment needed for these distances make the l4 and l5 locations unrealistic for relay stations and the inherent stability of these regions although beneficial in terms of station-keeping also attracts dust and asteroids which could pose a risk despite that concern the stereo probes passed through the l4 and l5 regions without damage in late 2009.nrecent work by the university of strathclydes advanced space concepts laboratory in collaboration with the european space agency has suggested an alternative relay architecture based on highly non-keplerian orbits these are a special kind of orbit produced when continuous low-thrust propulsion such as that produced from an ion engine or solar sail modifies the natural trajectory of a spacecraft such an orbit would enable continuous communications during solar conjunction by allowing a relay spacecraft to hover above mars out of the orbital plane of the two planets such a relay avoids the problems of satellites stationed at either l4 or l5 by being significantly closer to the surface of mars while still maintaining continuous communication between the two planets.nnrobotic precursorseditn astronauts approach viking 2 lander probenthe path to a human colony could be prepared by robotic systems such as the mars exploration rovers spirit opportunity and curiosity these systems could help locate resources such as ground water or ice that would help a colony grow and thrive the lifetimes of these systems would be years and even decades and as recent developments in commercial spaceflight have shown it may be that these systems will involve private as well as government ownership these robotic systems also have a reduced cost compared with early crewed operations and have less political risk.nwired systems might lay the groundwork for early crewed landings and bases by producing various consumables including fuel oxidizers water and construction materials establishing power communications shelter heating and manufacturing basics can begin with robotic systems if only as a prelude to crewed operations.nmars surveyor 2001 lander mip mars ispp precursor was to demonstrate manufacture of oxygen from the atmosphere of mars and test solar cell technologies and methods of mitigating the effect of martian dust on the power systems.nbefore any people are transported to mars on the notional 2030s interplanetary transport system envisioned by spacex a number of robotic cargo missions would be undertaken first in order to transport the requisite equipment habitats and supplies.nequipment that would be necessary would include machines to produce fertilizer methane and oxygen from mars atmospheric nitrogen and carbon dioxide and the planets subsurface water ice as well as construction materials to build transparent domes for initial agricultural areas.nneconomicseditn ironnickel meteorite found on marss surface heat shield rocknas with early colonies in the new world economics would be a crucial aspect to a colonys success the reduced gravity well of mars and its position in the solar system may facilitate marsearth trade and may provide an economic rationale for continued settlement of the planet given its size and resources this might eventually be a place to grow food and produce equipment to mine the asteroid belt.na major economic problem is the enormous up-front investment required to establish the colony and perhaps also terraform the planet for martian colonization to be successful and sustainable martian human settlements have to become viable economic units since using physical money in space will be a costly process it is thought that blockchains and cryptocurrencies may be an option.nsome early mars colonies might specialize in developing local resources for martian consumption such as water and/or ice local resources can also be used in infrastructure construction one source of martian ore currently known to be available is metallic iron in the form of nickeliron meteorites iron in this form is more easily extracted than from the iron oxides that cover the planet.nanother main inter-martian trade good during early colonization could be manure assuming that life doesnt exist on mars the soil is going to be very poor for growing plants so manure and other fertilizers will be valued highly in any martian civilization until the planet changes enough chemically to support growing vegetation on its own.nsolar power is a candidate for power for a martian colony solar insolation the amount of solar radiation that reaches mars is about 42 of that on earth since mars is about 52 farther from the sun and insolation falls off as the square of distance but the thin atmosphere would allow almost all of that energy to reach the surface as compared to earth where the atmosphere absorbs roughly a quarter of the solar radiation sunlight on the surface of mars would be much like a moderately cloudy day on earth.nneconomic driverseditnspace colonization on mars can roughly be said to be possible when the necessary methods of space colonization become cheap enough such as space access by cheaper launch systems to meet the cumulative funds that have been gathered for the purpose.nalthough there are no immediate prospects for the large amounts of money required for any space colonization to be available given traditional launch costs there is some prospect of a radical reduction to launch costs in the 2020s which would consequently lessen the cost of any efforts in that direction with a published price of us$62 million per launch of up to 22,800 kg 50,300 lb payload to low earth orbit or 4,020 kg 8,860 lb to mars spacex falcon 9 rockets are already the cheapest in the industry spacexs reusable plans include falcon heavy and future methane-based launch vehicles including the interplanetary transport system if spacex is successful in developing the reusable technology it would be expected to have a major impact on the cost of access to space and change the increasingly competitive market in space launch services.nalternative funding approaches might include the creation of inducement prizes for example the 2004 presidents commission on implementation of united states space exploration policy suggested that an inducement prize contest should be established perhaps by government for the achievement of space colonization one example provided was offering a prize to the first organization to place humans on the moon and sustain them for a fixed period before they return to earth.nnpossible locations for settlementseditn cropped version of a hirise image of a lava tube skylight entrance on the martian volcano pavonis mons.nnsee also caves of mars projectnmars odyssey found what appear to be natural caves near the volcano arsia mons it has been speculated that settlers could benefit from the shelter that these or similar structures could provide from radiation and micrometeoroids geothermal energy is also suspected in the equatorial regions.nnnseveral possible martian lava tube skylights have been located on the flanks of arsia mons earth based examples indicate that some should have lengthy passages offering complete protection from radiation and be relatively easy to seal using on-site materials especially in small subsections.nnhellas planitiaeditnhellas planitia is the lowest lying plain below the martian geodetic datum the air pressure is relatively higher in this place when compared to the rest of mars some analysts have calculated that one needs to drill into the martian crust for around 16.5 kilometers at hellas planitia to achieve an air pressure equivalent to that on the summit of mount everest an open air human settlement can then be built within the martian crust.nnplanetary protectioneditnsee also planetary protectionnrobotic spacecraft to mars are required to be sterilized to have at most 300,000 spores on the exterior of the craftand more thoroughly sterilized if they contact special regions containing water otherwise there is a risk of contaminating not only the life-detection experiments but possibly the planet itself.nit is impossible to sterilize human missions to this level as humans are host to typically a hundred trillion microorganisms of thousands of species of the human microbiome and these cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human containment seems the only option but it is a major challenge in the event of a hard landing i.e crash there have been several planetary workshops on this issue but with no final guidelines for a way forward yet human explorers would also be vulnerable to back contamination to earth if they become carriers of microorganisms.nnethical political and legal challengeseditnone possible ethical challenge that space travelers might face is that of pregnancy during the trip according to nasas policies it is forbidden for members of the crew to engage in sex in space nasa wants its crewmembers to treat each other like coworkers would in a professional environment a pregnant member on a spacecraft is dangerous to all those aboard the pregnant woman and child would most likely need additional nutrition from the rations aboard as well as special treatment and care at some point during the trip the pregnancy would most likely impede on the pregnant crew members duties and abilities it is still not fully known how the environment in a spacecraft would affect the development of a child aboard it is known however that an unborn child in space would be more susceptible to solar radiation which would likely have a negative effect on its cells and genetics during a long trip to mars it is likely that members of craft may engage in sex due to their stressful and isolated environment.nit is unforeseen how the first human landing on mars will change the current policies regarding the exploration of space and occupancy of celestial bodies in the 1967 united nations treaty on principles governing the activities of states in the exploration and use of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies it was determined that no country may take claim to space or its inhabitants since the planet mars offers a challenging environment and dangerous obstacles for humans to overcome the laws and culture on the planet will most likely be very different from those on earth with elon musk announcing his plans for travel to mars it is uncertain how the dynamic of a private company possibly being the first to put a human on mars will play out on a national and global scale nasa had to deal with several cuts in funding during the presidency of barack obama the objective for nasa to reach mars was pushed to the background in 2017 president donald trump promised to return humans to the moon and eventually mars effectively taking action by increasing nasa budget with 1.1 billion and mostly focus on the development of the new space launch system.nnadvocacyeditn buzz aldrin the 2nd human to set foot on the moon has recommended human mars missionsnmars colonization is advocated by several non-governmental groups for a range of reasons and with varied proposals one of the oldest groups is the mars society who promote a nasa program to accomplish human exploration of mars and have set up mars analog research stations in canada and the united states mars to stay advocates recycling emergency return vehicles into permanent settlements as soon as initial explorers determine permanent habitation is possible mars one which went public in june 2012 aims to coordinate not build a human colony on mars by 2027 with funding coming from a reality tv show and other commercial exploitation although this approach has been widely criticized as unrealistic and infeasible.nelon musk founded spacex with the long-term goal of developing the technologies that will enable a self-sustaining human colony on mars in 2015 he stated i think weve got a decent shot of sending a person to mars in 11 or 12 years richard branson in his lifetime is determined to be a part of starting a population on mars i think it is absolutely realistic it will happen i think over the next 20 years we will take literally hundreds of thousands of people to space and that will give us the financial resources to do even bigger things".nin june 2013 buzz aldrin american engineer and former astronaut and the second person to walk on the moon wrote an opinion published in the new york times supporting a human mission to mars and viewing the moon not as a destination but more a point of departure one that places humankind on a trajectory to homestead mars and become a two-planet species in august 2015 aldrin in association with the florida institute of technology presented a master plan for nasa consideration for astronauts with a tour of duty of ten years to colonize mars before the year 2040.nnin fictioneditnmain article mars in fictionna few instances in fiction provide detailed descriptions of mars colonization they
