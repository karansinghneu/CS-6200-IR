human extinction wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnsee also global catastrophic risknthe hypothetical end of the human speciesnnn nuclear war is an often predicted cause of the extinction of humanity.nin futures studies human extinction is the hypothetical end of the human species this may result from natural causes or it may be the result of human action the likelihood of human extinction in future by wholly natural scenarios such as a meteorite impact or large-scale volcanism is generally considered to be extremely low.nfor anthropogenic extinction many possible scenarios have been proposed human global nuclear annihilation biological warfare or the release of a pandemic-causing agent dysgenics overpopulation ecological collapse and climate change in addition emerging technologies could bring about new extinction scenarios such as advanced artificial intelligence biotechnology or self-replicating nanobots the probability of anthropogenic human extinction within the next hundred years is the topic of an active debate.nhuman extinction needs to be differentiated from the extinction of all life on earth see also future of earth and from the extinction of major components of human culture e.g through a global catastrophe leaving only small scattered human populations which might evolve in isolation.nncontentsnnnmoral importance of existential riskeditn"existential risks are risks that threaten the entire future of humanity whether by causing human extinction or by otherwise permanently crippling human progress many scholars make an argument based on the size of the cosmic endowment and state that because of the inconceivably large number of potential future lives that are at stake even small reductions of existential risk have great value some of the arguments run as follows:nnnparfit argues that the size of the cosmic endowment can be calculated from the following argument if earth remains habitable for a billion more years and can sustainably support a population of more than a billion humans then there is a potential for 10 or 10,000,000,000,000,000 human lives of normal duration bostrom goes further stating that if the universe is empty then the accessible universe can support at least 10 biological human life-years and if some humans were uploaded onto computers could even support the equivalent of 10 cybernetic human life-years.nnpossible scenarioseditnsee also global catastrophic risk and category:doomsday scenariosnsevere forms of known or recorded disasterseditnnhabitat threatseditnnscientific

scenarios of extraterrestrial origineditnmajor impact events and gamma-ray burst in our part of the milky way were already mentioned above.nnnevolution of a posthuman specieseditnmain articles posthumanism and transhumanismnnormal biological evolution of humanity will continue and change humans over geological time scales although this could in a non-phylogenetic taxonomy be considered to give rise of a new species such an ongoing evolution would biologically not be considered a species extinction given the likelihood that significant genetic exchange between human populations will continue it is highly unlikely that humans will split into multiple species through natural evolution.nsome scenarios envision that humans could use genetic engineering or technological modifications to split into normal humans and a new species posthumans such a species could be fundamentally different from any previous life form on earth e.g by merging humans with technological systems such scenarios do harbor a risk of the extinction of the old human species by means of the new posthuman entity.nnextinction through devolutioneditnhumans are doing so well that theres no more survival of the fittest this was highly debated in the 19th century in the form of devolution and degeneration.nnperception of and reactions to human extinction riskeditnprobability estimateseditnbecause human extinction is unprecedented speculation about the probability of different scenarios is highly subjective nick bostrom argues that it would be misguided to assume that the probability of near-term extinction is less than 25 and that it will be a tall order for the human race to get our precautions sufficiently right the first time given that an existential risk provides no opportunity to learn from failure a little more optimistically philosopher john leslie assigns a 70 chance of humanity surviving the next five centuries based partly on the controversial philosophical doomsday argument that leslie champions the 2006 stern review for the uk treasury assumes the 100-year probability of human extinction is 10 in its economic calculations.nsome scholars believe that certain scenarios such as global thermonuclear war would have difficulty eradicating every last settlement on earth physicist willard wells points out that any credible extinction scenario would have to reach into a diverse set of areas including the underground subways of major cities the mountains of tibet the remotest islands of the south pacific and even to mcmurdo station in antarctica which has contingency plans and supplies for a long isolation in addition elaborate bunkers exist for government leaders to occupy during a nuclear war any number of events could lead to a massive loss of human life but if the last few but see minimum viable population most resilient humans are unlikely to also die off then that particular human extinction scenario is not credible.nnpsychologyeditnsee also existentialism angst and dreadneliezer yudkowsky theorizes that scope neglect plays a role in public perception of existential risks:nnsubstantially larger numbers such as 500 million deaths and especially qualitatively different scenarios such as the extinction of the entire human species seem to trigger a different mode of thinking people who would never dream of hurting a child hear of an existential risk and say well maybe the human species doesnt really deserve to survive".nall past predictions of human extinction have proven to be false to some this makes future warnings seem less credible nick bostrom argues that the lack of human extinction in the past is weak evidence that there will be no human extinction in the future due to survivor bias and other anthropic effects.nsome behavioural finance scholars claim that recent evidence is given undue significance in risk analysis roughly speaking 100-year storms tend to occur every twenty years in the stock market as traders become convinced that the current good times will last forever doomsayers who hypothesize rare crisis scenarios are dismissed even when they have statistical evidence behind them an extreme form of this bias can diminish the subjective probability of the unprecedented.nnresearch and initiativeseditneven though the importance and potential impact of research on existential risks is often highlighted relatively few research efforts are being made in this field in 2001 bostrom stated:nnnalthough existential risks are less manageable by individuals than e.g health risks according to ken olum joshua knobe and alexander vilenkin the possibility of human extinction does have practical implications for instance if the universal doomsday argument is accepted it changes the most likely source of disasters and hence the most efficient means of preventing them they write you should be more concerned that a large number of asteroids have not yet been detected than about the particular orbit of each one you should not worry especially about the chance that some specific nearby star will become a supernova but more about the chance that supernovas are more deadly to nearby life than we believe."nmultiple organizations with the goal of helping prevent human extinction exist examples are the future of humanity institute the centre for the study of existential risk the future of life institute the machine intelligence research institute and the global catastrophic risk institute est 2011.nnomnicideeditn placard against omnicide at extinction rebellion 2018.nomnicide is human extinction as a result of human action most commonly it refers to extinction through nuclear warfare or biological warfare but it can also apply to extinction through means such as a global anthropogenic ecological catastrophe.nomnicide can be considered a subcategory of genocide using the concept in this way one can argue for example that:nnnhowever the cold war arms race differed from genocide in that the weapons involved were not used instead serving as nuclear deterrence.nnproposed countermeasureseditnfurther information global catastrophic risk precautions and preventionnstephen hawking advocated colonizing other planets within the solar system once technology progresses sufficiently in order to improve the chance of human survival from planet-wide events such as global thermonuclear war.nmore economically some scholars propose the establishment on earth of one or more self-sufficient remote permanently occupied settlements specifically created for the purpose of surviving global disaster economist robin hanson argues that a refuge permanently housing as few as 100 people would significantly improve the chances of human survival during a range of global catastrophes.nnin popular cultureeditnmain article apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fictionnsome 21st century pop-science works including the world without us by alan weisman pose an artistic thought

exceptions exist such as r.u.r and steven spielbergs a.i.nnsee alsoeditnnnoteseditnn for research on this see psychological science volume 15 2004 decisions from experience and the effect of rare events in risky choice the under-perception of rare events mentioned above is actually the opposite of the phenomenon originally described by kahneman in prospect theory in their original experiments the likelihood of rare events is overestimated however further analysis of the bias has shown that both forms occur when judging from description people tend to overestimate the described probability so this effect taken alone would indicate that reading the extinction scenarios described here should make the reader overestimate the likelihood of any probabilities given however the effect that is more relevant to common consideration of human extinction is the bias that occurs with estimates from experience and these are in the opposite direction when judging from personal experience people who have never heard of or experienced their species become extinct would be expected to dramatically underestimate its likelihood sociobiologist e o wilson argued that the reason for this myopic fog evolutionary biologists contend is that it was actually advantageous during all but the last few millennia of the two million years of existence of the genus homo a premium was placed on close
