years over the course of thailands gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialized and service-oriented between 19931995 ten percent of the thai labor force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs especially in the manufacturing sector it is estimated that between 19881995 the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million as thailands gdp tripled while the asian financial crisis that followed in 1997 hit the thai economy hard the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation as thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the imf and world bank these reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatization and trade liberalization in the country and decreased federal subsidization of public goods and utilities agricultural price supports and regulations on fair wages and labor conditions these changes put further pressure on the agricultural sector and prompted continued migration from the rural countryside to the growing cities many migrant farmers found work in thailands growing manufacturing industry and took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labor regulations and often exploitative conditions.nthose that could not find formal factory work including illegal migrants and the families of rural thai migrants that followed their relatives to the urban centers turned to the informal sector to provide the extra support needed for survivalunder the widespread regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programs one family member working in a factory or sweatshop made very little scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of thailands labor reforms in the wake of the 1997 asian financial crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state this can be described as the externalization of market risk meaning that as the countrys labor market became increasingly deregulated the burden and responsibility of providing an adequate livelihood shifted from employers and the state to the workers themselves whose families had to find jobs in the informal sector to make up for the losses and subsidize the wages being made by their relatives in the formal sector the weight of these economic changes hit migrants and the urban poor especially hard and the informal sector expanded rapidly as a result.ntoday informal labor in thailand is typically broken down into three main groups subcontracted/self employed/home-based workers service workers including those that are employed in restaurants as street vendors masseuses taxi drivers and as domestic workers and agricultural workers not included in these categories are those that work in entertainment nightlife and the sex industry individuals employed in these facets of the informal labor sector face additional vulnerabilities including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking.nin general education levels are low in the informal sector a 2012 study found that 64 of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school many informal workers are also migrants only some of which have legal status in the country education and citizenship are two main barriers to entry for those looking to work in formal industries and enjoy the labor protections and social security benefits that come along with formal employment because the informal labor sector is not recognized under the labor protection act lpa informal workers are much more vulnerable labor to exploitation and unsafe working conditions than those employed in more formal and federally recognized industries while some thai labor laws provide minimal protections to domestic and agricultural workers they are often weak and difficult to enforce furthermore thai social security policies fail to protect against the risks many informal workers face including workplace accidents and compensation as well as unemployment and retirement insurance many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment and many do not make a living wage as a result labor trafficking is common in the region affecting children and adults men and women and migrants and thai citizens alike.nndemographicsnmain article demographics of thailandnn population
