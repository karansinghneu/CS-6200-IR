hypoxia medical wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchna condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen at the tissue level nnhypoxia is a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level hypoxia may be classified as either generalized affecting the whole body or local affecting a region of the body although hypoxia is often a pathological condition variations in arterial oxygen concentrations can be part of the normal physiology for example during hypoventilation training or strenuous physical exercise.nhypoxia differs from hypoxemia and anoxemia in that hypoxia refers to a state in which oxygen supply is insufficient whereas hypoxemia and anoxemia refer specifically to states that have low or zero arterial oxygen supply hypoxia in which there is complete deprivation of oxygen supply is referred to as anoxia.ngeneralized hypoxia occurs in healthy people when they ascend to high altitude where it causes altitude sickness leading to potentially fatal complications high altitude pulmonary edema hape and high altitude cerebral edema hace hypoxia also occurs in healthy individuals when breathing mixtures of gases with a low oxygen content e.g while diving underwater especially when using closed-circuit rebreather systems that control the amount of oxygen in the supplied air mild non-damaging intermittent hypoxia is used intentionally during altitude training to develop an athletic performance adaptation at both the systemic and cellular level.nhypoxia is a common complication of preterm birth in newborn infants because the lungs develop late in pregnancy premature infants frequently possess underdeveloped lungs to improve lung function doctors frequently place infants at risk of hypoxia inside incubators also known as humidicribs that provide continuous positive airway pressure.nncontentsnnngeneralized hypoxiaeditnthe symptoms of generalized hypoxia depend on its severity and acceleration of onset.nin the case of altitude sickness where hypoxia develops gradually the symptoms include fatigue numbness tingling of extremities nausea and cerebral anoxia these symptoms are often difficult to identify but early detection of symptoms can be critical.nin severe hypoxia or hypoxia of very rapid onset ataxia confusion disorientation hallucinations behavioral change severe headaches reduced level of consciousness papilloedema breathlessness pallor tachycardia and pulmonary hypertension eventually leading to the late signs cyanosis slow heart rate cor pulmonale and low blood pressure followed by heart failure eventually leading to shock and death.nbecause hemoglobin is a darker red when it is not bound to oxygen deoxyhemoglobin as opposed to the rich red color that it has when bound to oxygen oxyhemoglobin when seen through the skin it has an increased tendency to reflect blue light back to the eye in cases where the oxygen is displaced by another molecule such as carbon monoxide the skin may appear cherry red instead of cyanotic hypoxia can cause premature birth and injure the liver among other deleterious effects.nnlocal hypoxiaeditnif tissue is not being perfused properly it may feel cold and appear pale if severe hypoxia can result in cyanosis a blue discoloration of the skin if hypoxia is very severe a tissue may eventually become gangrenous.nextreme pain may also be felt at or around the site.ntissue hypoxia from low oxygen delivery may be due to low haemoglobin concentration anaemic hypoxia low cardiac output stagnant hypoxia or low haemoglobin saturation hypoxic hypoxia the consequence of oxygen deprivation in tissues is a switch to anaerobic metabolism at the cellular level as such reduced systemic blood flow may result in increased serum lactate serum lactate levels have been correlated with illness severity and mortality in critically ill adults and in ventilated neonates with respiratory distress.nncauseeditnoxygen passively diffuses in the lung alveoli according to a pressure gradient oxygen diffuses from the breathed air mixed with water vapour to arterial blood where its partial pressure is around 100 mmhg 13.3 kpa in the blood oxygen is bound to hemoglobin a protein in red blood cells the binding capacity of hemoglobin is influenced by the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment as described in the oxygenhemoglobin dissociation curve a smaller amount of oxygen is transported in solution in the blood.nin peripheral tissues oxygen again diffuses down a pressure gradient into cells and their mitochondria where it is used to produce energy in conjunction with the breakdown of glucose fats and some amino acids.nhypoxia can result from a failure at any stage in the delivery of oxygen to cells this can include decreased partial pressures of oxygen problems with diffusion of oxygen in the lungs insufficient available hemoglobin problems with blood flow to the end tissue and problems with breathing rhythm.nexperimentally oxygen diffusion becomes rate limiting and lethal when arterial oxygen partial pressure falls to 60 mmhg 5.3 kpa or below.nalmost all the oxygen in the blood is bound to hemoglobin so interfering with this carrier molecule limits oxygen delivery to the periphery hemoglobin increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood by about 40-fold with the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen influenced by the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment a relationship described in the oxygenhemoglobin dissociation curve when the ability of hemoglobin to carry oxygen is interfered with a hypoxic state can result.nnischemiaeditnmain article ischemianischemia meaning insufficient blood flow to a tissue can also result in hypoxia this is called ischemic hypoxia this can include an embolic event a heart attack that decreases overall blood flow or trauma to a tissue that results in damage an example of insufficient blood flow causing local hypoxia is gangrene that occurs in diabetes.ndiseases such as peripheral vascular disease can also result in local hypoxia for this reason symptoms are worse when a limb is used pain may also be felt as a result of increased hydrogen ions leading to a decrease in blood ph acidity created as a result of anaerobic metabolism.nnhypoxemic hypoxiaeditnmain article hypoxemianthis refers specifically to hypoxic states where the arterial content of oxygen is insufficient this can be caused by alterations in respiratory drive such as in respiratory alkalosis physiological or pathological shunting of blood diseases interfering in lung function resulting in a ventilation-perfusion mismatch such as a pulmonary embolus or alterations in the partial pressure of oxygen in the environment or lung alveoli such as may occur at altitude or when diving.nncarbon monoxide poisoningeditnmain article carbon monoxide poisoningncarbon monoxide competes with oxygen for binding sites on hemoglobin molecules as carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin hundreds of times tighter than oxygen it can prevent the carriage of oxygen.ncarbon monoxide poisoning can occur acutely as with smoke intoxication or over a period of time as with cigarette smoking due to physiological processes carbon monoxide is maintained at a resting level of 46 ppm this is increased in urban areas 713 ppm and in smokers 2040 ppm a carbon monoxide level of 40 ppm is equivalent to a reduction in hemoglobin levels of 10 g/l.nco has a second toxic effect namely removing the allosteric shift of the oxygen dissociation curve and shifting the foot of the curve to the left in so doing the hemoglobin is less likely to release its oxygens at the peripheral tissues certain abnormal hemoglobin variants also have higher than normal affinity for oxygen and so are also poor at delivering oxygen to the periphery.nnaltitudeeditnmain article altitude sicknessnatmospheric pressure reduces with altitude and with it the amount of oxygen the reduction in the partial pressure of inspired oxygen at higher altitudes lowers the oxygen saturation of the blood ultimately leading to hypoxia the clinical features of altitude sickness include sleep problems dizziness headache and oedema.innhypoxic breathing gaseseditnmain articles inert gas asphyxiation and asphyxiant gasesnthe breathing gas in scuba diving may contain an insufficient partial pressure of oxygen particularly in malfunction of rebreathers such situations may lead to unconsciousness without symptoms since carbon dioxide levels are normal and the human body senses pure hypoxia poorly.na similar problem exists when inhaling certain odorless asphyxiant gases asphyxiant gases reduce/displace the normal oxygen concentration in breathing air where prolonged exposure to this hypoxic breathing gas leads to unconsciousness followed by death by inert gas asphyxiation suffocation when oxygen level dips below 19.5 v/v the air is considered oxygen-deficient where oxygen concentrations below 16 volume are considered highly dangerous for humans as asphyxiant gases are relatively inert and odorless their presence may not be noticed until the effects of elevated blood carbon dioxide hypercapnia are recognized by the body inert gas asphyxiation may be deliberate with use of a suicide bag accidental death has occurred in cases where concentrations of nitrogen in controlled atmospheres or methane in mines has not been detected or appreciated.nnothereditnhemoglobins function can also be lost by chemically oxidizing its iron atom to its ferric form this form of inactive hemoglobin is called methemoglobin and can be made by ingesting sodium nitrite as well as certain drugs and other chemicals.nnanemiaeditnmain article anemianhemoglobin plays a substantial role in carrying oxygen throughout the body and when it is deficient anemia can result causing anaemic hypoxia if tissue perfusion is decreased iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia as iron is used in the synthesis of hemoglobin less hemoglobin will be synthesised when there is less iron due to insufficient intake or poor absorption.nanemia is typically a chronic process that is compensated over time by increased levels of red blood cells via upregulated erythropoetin a chronic hypoxic state can result from a poorly compensated anaemia.nnhistotoxic hypoxiaeditncyanide poisoningeditnhistotoxic hypoxia results when the quantity of oxygen reaching the cells is normal but the cells are unable to use the oxygen effectively as a result of disabled oxidative phosphorylation enzymes this may occur in cyanide poisoning.nnphysiological compensationeditnacuteeditnif oxygen delivery to cells is insufficient for the demand hypoxia electrons will be shifted to pyruvic acid in the process of lactic acid fermentation this temporary measure anaerobic metabolism allows small amounts of energy to be released lactic acid build up in tissues and blood is a sign of inadequate mitochondrial oxygenation which may be due to hypoxemia poor blood flow e.g shock or a combination of both if severe or prolonged it could lead to cell death.nin humans hypoxia is detected by the peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid body and aortic body with the carotid body chemoreceptors being the major mediators of reflex responses to hypoxia this response does not control ventilation rate at normal po but below normal the activity of neurons innervating these receptors increases dramatically so much so to override the signals from central chemoreceptors in the hypothalamus increasing po despite a falling pconit is seen in a few humans encountered with hypoxia there is word loss in their speech due to their state of confusion and cell damage in the brain.nin most tissues of the body the response to hypoxia is vasodilation by widening the blood vessels the tissue allows greater perfusion.nby contrast in the lungs the response to hypoxia is vasoconstriction this is known as hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction or hpv".nnchroniceditnwhen the pulmonary capillary pressure remains elevated chronically for at least 2 weeks the lungs become even more resistant to pulmonary edema because the lymph vessels expand greatly increasing their capability of carrying fluid away from the interstitial spaces perhaps as much as 10-fold therefore in patients with chronic mitral stenosis pulmonary capillary pressures of 40 to 45 mm hg have been measured without the development of lethal pulmonary edema.guytun and hall physiologynhypoxia exists when there is a reduced amount of oxygen in the tissues of the body hypoxemia refers to a reduction in po2 below the normal range regardless of whether gas exchange is impaired in the lung cao2 is adequate or tissue hypoxia exists there are several potential physiologic mechanisms for hypoxemia but in patients with copd the predominant one is v/q mismatching with or without alveolar hypoventilation as indicated by paco2 hypoxemia caused by v/q mismatching as seen in copd is relatively easy to correct so that only comparatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen less than 3 l/min for the majority of patients are required for ltot although hypoxemia normally stimulates ventilation and produces dyspnea these phenomena and the other symptoms and signs of hypoxia are sufficiently variable in patients with copd as to be of limited value in patient assessment chronic alveolar hypoxia is the main factor leading to development of cor pulmonaleright ventricular hypertrophy with or without overt right ventricular failurein patients with copd pulmonary hypertension adversely affects survival in copd to an extent that parallels the degree to which resting mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated although the severity of airflow obstruction as measured by fev1 is the best correlate with overall prognosis in patients with copd chronic hypoxemia increases mortality and morbidity for any severity of disease large-scale studies of ltot in patients with copd have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between daily hours of oxygen use and survival there is reason to believe that continuous 24-hours-per-day oxygen use in appropriately selected patients would produce a survival benefit even greater than that shown in the nott and mrc studies.nntreatmenteditnto counter the effects of high-altitude diseases the body must return arterial po toward normal acclimatization the means by which the body adapts to higher altitudes only partially restores po to standard levels hyperventilation the bodys most common response to high-altitude conditions increases alveolar po by raising the depth and rate of breathing however while po does improve with hyperventilation it does not return to normal studies of miners and astronomers working at 3000 meters and above show improved alveolar po with full acclimatization yet the po level remains equal to or even below the threshold for continuous oxygen therapy for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd in addition there are complications involved with acclimatization polycythemia in which the body increases the number of red blood cells in circulation thickens the blood raising the danger that the heart cant pump it.nin high-altitude conditions only oxygen enrichment can counteract the effects of hypoxia by increasing the concentration of oxygen in the air the effects of lower barometric pressure are countered and the level of arterial po is restored toward normal capacity a small amount of supplemental oxygen reduces the equivalent altitude in climate-controlled rooms at 4000 m raising the oxygen concentration level by 5 percent via an oxygen concentrator and an existing ventilation system provides an altitude equivalent of 3000 m which is much more tolerable for the increasing number of low-landers who work in high altitude in a study of astronomers working in chile at 5050 m oxygen concentrators increased the level of oxygen concentration by almost 30 percent that is from 21 percent to 27 percent this resulted in increased worker productivity less fatigue and improved sleep.noxygen concentrators are uniquely suited for this purpose they require little maintenance and electricity provide a constant source of oxygen and eliminate the expensive and often dangerous task of transporting oxygen cylinders to remote areas offices and housing already have climate-controlled rooms in which temperature and humidity are kept at a constant level oxygen can be added to this system easily and relatively cheaply.na prescription renewal for home oxygen following hospitalization requires an assessment of the patient for ongoing hypoxemia.nnsee alsoeditnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
