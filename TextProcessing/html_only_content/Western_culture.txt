area is unclear and undefined more often a countrys ideology is what will be used to categorize it as a western society there is some disagreement about what nations should or should not be included in the category and at what times many parts of the eastern roman empire are considered western today but were eastern in the past geographically the west of today would include europe especially the european union countries together with extra-european territories belonging to the english-speaking world the hispanidad the lusosphere and the francophonie in the wider context since the context is highly biased and context-dependent there is no agreed definition what the west is.nit is difficult to determine which individuals fit into which category and the eastwest contrast is sometimes

history of western civilizationnnthe earliest civilizations which influenced the development of western culture were those of mesopotamia the area of the tigriseuphrates river system largely corresponding to modern-day iraq northeastern syria southeastern turkey and southwestern iran the cradle of civilization.nthe greeks contrasted themselves to their eastern neighbors such as the trojans in iliad setting an example for later contrasts between east and west in the middle ages the near east provided a contrast to the west though it had been hellenized since the time of alexander the great.nconcepts of what is the west arose out of legacies of the western roman empire and the eastern roman empire later ideas of the west were formed by the concepts of latin christendom and the holy roman empire what we think of as western thought today originates primarily from greco-roman and germanic influences and includes the ideals of the middle ages the renaissance and the enlightenment as well as christian culture.nnclassical westeditn alexander the greatnin homeric literature and right up until the time of alexander the great for example in the accounts of the persian wars of greeks against persians by herodotus we see the paradigm of a contrast between the west and east.nnevertheless the greeks felt they were the most civilized and saw themselves in the formulation of aristotle as something between the wild barbarians of most of europe and the soft slavish middle-easterners ancient greek science philosophy democracy architecture literature and art provided a foundation embraced and built upon by the roman empire as it swept up europe including the hellenic world in its conquests in the 1st century bce in the meantime however greece under alexander had become a capital of the east and part of an empire the celts also created some significant literature in the ancient world whenever they were given the opportunity an example being the poet caecilius statius they also developed a large amount of scientific knowledge themselves as seen in their coligny calendar.nn the maison carre in nmes one of the best-preserved roman temples it is a mid-sized augustan provincial temple of the theocratic imperial cult of the empire the imperial cult was inseparable from that of romes official deities whose cult was essential to romes survival and whose neglect was therefore treasonous traditional cult was a focus of imperial revivalist legislation under decius and diocletian.n the roman empire at its greatest extent.nfor about five hundred years the roman empire maintained the greek east and consolidated a latin west but an east-west division remained reflected in many cultural norms of the two areas including language although rome like greece was no longer democratic the idea of democracy remained a part of the education of citizens.neventually the empire became increasingly split into a western and eastern part reviving old ideas of a contrast between an advanced east and a rugged west in the roman world one could speak of three main directions north celtic tribal states and parthians the east lux ex oriente and finally south which implied danger historically via the punic wars quid novi ex africa?.nfrom the time of alexander the great the hellenistic period greek civilization came in contact with jewish civilization christianity would eventually emerge from the syncretism of hellenic culture roman culture and second temple judaism gradually spreading across the roman empire and eclipsing its antecedents and influences the rise of christianity reshaped much of the graeco-roman tradition and culture the christianised culture would be the basis for the development of western civilization after the fall of rome which resulted from increasing pressure from barbarians outside roman culture roman culture also mixed with celtic germanic and slavic cultures which slowly became integrated into western culture starting mainly with their acceptance of christianity.nnmedieval westeditn two main symbols of the medieval western civilization on one picture the gothic st martins cathedral in spisk podhradie slovakia and the spi castle behind the cathedral.n justinian inthe medieval west was at its broadest the same as christendom including both the latin west also called frankish during charlemagnes

part of the old empire however this would become the centre of a new west europe fell into political anarchy with many warring kingdoms and principalities under the frankish kings it eventually and partially reunified and the anarchy evolved into feudalism.nmuch of the basis of the post-roman cultural world had been set before the fall of the empire mainly through the integration and reshaping of roman ideas through christian thought the greek and roman paganism had been completely replaced by christianity around the 4th and 5th centuries since it became the official state religion following the baptism of emperor constantine i orthodox christian christianity and the nicene creed served as a unifying force in christian parts of europe and in some respects replaced or competed with the secular authorities the jewish christian tradition out of which it had emerged was all but extinguished and antisemitism became increasingly entrenched or even integral to christendom art and

scholastics wrote it is they who come nearer than does any other group to having been the founders of scientific economics other economists and historians such as raymond de roover marjorie grice-hutchinson and alejandro chafuen have also made similar statements historian paul legutko of stanford university said the catholic church is at the center of the development of the values ideas science laws and institutions which constitute what we call western civilization."nin a broader sense the middle ages with its fertile encounter between greek philosophical reasoning and levantine monotheism was not confined to the west but also stretched into the old east the philosophy and science of classical greece was largely forgotten in europe after the collapse of the western roman empire other than in isolated monastic enclaves notably in ireland which had become christian but was never conquered by rome the learning of classical antiquity was better preserved in the byzantine eastern roman empire justinians corpus juris civilis roman civil law code was preserved in the east and constantinople maintained trade and intermittent political control over outposts such as venice in the west for centuries classical greek learning was also subsumed preserved and elaborated in the rising eastern world which gradually supplanted roman-byzantine control as a dominant cultural-political force thus much of the learning of classical antiquity was slowly reintroduced to european civilization in the centuries following the collapse of the western roman empire.nthe rediscovery of the justinian code in western europe early in the 10th century rekindled a passion for the discipline of law which crossed many of the re-forming boundaries between east and west in the catholic or frankish west roman law became the foundation on which all legal concepts and systems were based its influence is found in all western legal systems although in different manners and to different extents the study of canon law the legal system of the catholic church fused with that of roman law to form the basis of the refounding of western legal scholarship during the reformation and enlightenment the ideas of civil rights equality before the law procedural justice and democracy as the ideal form of society began to be institutionalized as principles forming the basis of modern western culture particularly in protestant regions.nn thomas aquinas a catholic philosopher of the middle ages revived and developed natural law from ancient greek philosophy.nin the 14th century starting from italy and then spreading throughout europe there was a massive artistic architectural scientific and philosophical revival as a result of the christian revival of greek philosophy and the long christian medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities this period is commonly referred to as the renaissance in the following century this process was further enhanced by an exodus of greek christian priests and scholars to italian cities such as venice after the end of the byzantine empire with the fall of constantinople.nn the discovery of the new world by christopher columbus.nfrom late antiquity through the middle ages and onwards while eastern europe was shaped by the orthodox church southern and central europe were increasingly stabilized by the catholic church which as roman imperial governance faded from view was the only consistent force in western europe in 1054 came the so-called great schism that following the greek east and latin west divide separated europe into religious and cultural regions present to this day until the age of enlightenment christian culture took over as the predominant force in western civilization guiding the course of philosophy art and science for many years movements in art and philosophy such as the humanist movement of the renaissance and the scholastic movement of the high middle ages were motivated by a drive to connect catholicism with greek and arab thought imported by christian pilgrims however due to the division in western christianity caused by the protestant reformation and the enlightenment religious influenceespecially the temporal power of the popebegan to wane.nfrom the late 15th century to the 17th century western culture began to spread to other parts of the world through explorers and missionaries during the age of discovery and by imperialists from the 17th century to the early 20th century during the great divergence a term coined by samuel huntington the western world overcame pre-modern growth constraints and emerged during the 19th century as the most powerful and wealthy world civilization of the time eclipsing qing china mughal india tokugawa japan and the ottoman empire the process was accompanied and reinforced by the age of discovery and continued into the modern period scholars have proposed a wide variety of theories to explain why the great divergence happened including lack of government intervention geography colonialism and customary traditions.nnmodern eraeditn the united states constitutionncoming into the modern era the historical understanding of the east-west contrastas the opposition of christendom to its geographical neighborsbegan to weaken as religion became less important and europeans came into increasing contact with far away peoples the old concept of western culture began a slow evolution towards what it is today the age of discovery faded into the age of enlightenment of the 18th century during which cultural and intellectual forces in western europe emphasized reason analysis and individualism rather than traditional lines of authority it challenged the authority of institutions that were deeply rooted in society such as the catholic church there was much talk of ways to reform society with toleration science and skepticism.nphilosophers of the enlightenment included francis bacon ren descartes john locke baruch spinoza voltaire 16941778 david hume and immanuel kant influenced society by publishing widely read works upon learning about enlightened views some rulers met with intellectuals and tried to apply their reforms such as allowing for toleration or accepting multiple religions in what became known as

that was edited by denis diderot and jean le rond dalembert the dictionnaire philosophique philosophical dictionary 1764 and letters on the english 1733 written by voltaire spread the ideals of the enlightenment.ncoinciding with the age of enlightenment was the scientific revolution spearheaded by newton this included the emergence of modern science during which developments in mathematics physics astronomy biology including human anatomy and chemistry transformed views of society and nature while its dates are disputed the publication in 1543 of nicolaus copernicuss de revolutionibus

revolution in great britain and the world.nthe industrial revolution marks a major turning point in history almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way in particular average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth some economists say that the major impact of the industrial revolution was that the standard of living for the general population began to increase consistently for the first time in history although others have said that it did not begin to meaningfully improve until the late 19th and 20th centuries the precise start and end of the industrial revolution is still debated among historians as is the pace of economic and social changes gdp per capita was broadly stable before the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy while the industrial revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies economic historians are in agreement that the onset of the industrial revolution is the most important event in the history of humanity since the domestication of animals plants and fire.nthe first industrial revolution evolved into the second industrial revolution in the transition years between 1840 and 1870 when technological and economic progress continued with the increasing adoption of steam transport steam-powered railways boats and ships the large-scale
