as of june 2012.n a full-size model of the earth observation satellite ers 2nin the context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earths moon.non 4 october 1957 the soviet union launched the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 since then about 8,100 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched according to a 2018 estimate some 4,900 remain in orbit of those about 1,900 were operational while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit at 20,000 km and the rest are in geostationary orbit at 36,000 km a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn a few asteroids a comet and the sun.nsatellites are used for many purposes among several other applications they can be used to make star maps and maps of planetary surfaces and also take pictures of planets they are launched into common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known overlapping classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbit.na launch vehicle is a rocket that places a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane see air launch to orbit.nsatellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control and orbit control.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnearly conceptionseditn konstantin

experiment in a treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite.nthe first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon the idea surfaced again in jules vernes the begums fortune 1879.nin 1903 konstantin tsiolkovsky 18571935 published exploring space using jet propulsion devices in russian which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve this.nin 1928 herman potonik 18921929 published his sole book the problem of space travel the rocket motor german das problem der befahrung des weltraums der raketen-motor he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments.nin a 1945 wireless world article the english science fiction writer arthur c clarke 19172008 described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.nthe us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29 december 1948 that his office was coordinating that project between the various services.nnartificial satelliteseditn sputnik 1 the first artificial satellite to orbit earth.nthe first artificial satellite was sputnik 1 launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united states.nsputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1s success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold war.nsputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laika.nin may 1946 project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century."nthe united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air forces project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954 the secretary of defense stated i know of no american satellite program in february 1954 project rand released scientific uses for a satellite vehicle written by r.r carhart this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with the scientific use of an artificial satellite by h.k kallmann and w.w kellogg.nin the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year 195758 the white house announced on 29 july 1955 that the u.s intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958 this became known as project vanguard on 31 july the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.nfollowing pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs the armys which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civilian/navy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2 the project succeeded explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958.nin june 1961 three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellites.nearly satellites were constructed as one-off designs with growth in geosynchronous geo satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333 geo commsat launched in 1972.ncurrently the largest artificial satellite ever is the international space station.nn 1u cubesat estcube-1 developed mainly by the students from the university of tartu carries out a tether deployment experiment in low earth orbit.nspace surveillance networkeditnmain article united states space surveillance networknthe united states space surveillance network ssn a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earths orbit since 1957 when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26,000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8,000-man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earths atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites i.e 560 satellites the rest are space debris the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles.nnnon-military satellite serviceseditnthere are three basic categories of non-military satellite

earth orbit the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit the green dash-dot line the orbit of global positioning system gps satellites and the red dotted line the orbit of the international space station iss.nthe first satellite sputnik 1 was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,886 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricity.nthe commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit leo medium earth orbit meo and high earth orbit heo low earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786 km high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786 km.nncentric classificationseditnnthe general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial

operations characteristics looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite one discovers two modules note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy.nnspacecraft bus or service moduleeditnthe bus module consists of the following subsystems:nnstructural subsystemeditnthe structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage.nntelemetry subsystemeditnthe telemetry subsystem aka command and data handling c&dh monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control stations commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.nnpower subsystemeditnthe power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earths shadow nuclear power sources radioisotope thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program 19641978.nnthermal control subsystemeditnmain article spacecraft thermal controlnthe thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellites body e.g optical solar reflectornnattitude and orbit control subsystemeditnmain articles attitude control and spacecraft propulsionnthe attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators reaction wheels thrusters these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directions.nncommunication payloadeditnthe second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable of nnnend of lifeeditnwhen satellites reach the end of their mission this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1 launched in 1958 vanguard 1 the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of march 2015 as well as the upper stage of its launch rocket.ninstead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit as of 2002 the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the solar flux and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78 km with a range between 72 and 84 km solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95 km.nnlaunch-capable countrieseditnmain article timeline of first orbital launches by nationalitynthis list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit including production of the necessary launch vehicle note many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them instead relying on foreign launch services this list does not consider those numerous countries but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously and the date this capability was first demonstrated the list does not include the european space agency a multi-national state organization nor private consortiums.nnnnattempted first launcheseditnnnother

been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks.nfor testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth russia the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites in 2007 the chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february 2008.nnjammingeditnsee also radio jammingndue to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitters range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.nalso it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellites transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively.nnearth observation using satelliteseditnduring the last five decades space agencies have sent thousands of space crafts space capsules or satellites to the universe in fact weathermen make forecasts on the weather and natural calamities based on observations from these satellites.nthe national aeronautics and space administration nasa requested the national academies to publish a report entitled earth observations from space the first 50 years of scientific achievements in 2008 it described how the capability to view the whole globe simultaneously from satellite observations revolutionized studies about the planet earth this development brought about a new age of combined earth sciences the national academies report concluded that continuing earth observations from the galaxy are necessary to resolve scientific and social challenges in the future.nnasanthe nasa introduced an earth observing system eos composed of several satellites science component and data system described as the earth observing system

future-focused team that works to harness the potentials of ai and other disruptive innovations meanwhile the esa also announced that it expects to commence the qualification flight of the space rider space plane in 2021 this will come after several demonstration missions space rider is the sequel of the agencys intermediate experimental vehicle ixv which was launched in 2015 it has the capacity payload of 800 kilograms for orbital missions that will last a maximum of two months.nspacexnspacex was scheduled to launch a multiple satellite mission on november 28 2018 from the united states vandenberg air force base after an initial november 19 schedule the launch is expected to be visible once the rocket heads toward the south into an earth observation trajectory traveling over the opposites however the second supposed launched was delayed again because of poor weather conditions and set for another date which is not yet definite the mission is known as the sso-a smallsat express is another landmark for elon musk founder of spacex which had 19 rocket launches in 2018 alone the estimated cost of this falcon 9 rocket is approximately 62 million the rocket has 64 satellites with each one going separate ways.namazon and lockheednamazon web services aws and lockheed martin entered into a strategic partnership for the purpose of integrating the aws ground station
