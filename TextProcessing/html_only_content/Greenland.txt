kalaallit nunaat pronounced kalait nunat danish grnland pronounced nlan is an autonomous constituent country of the kingdom of denmark between the arctic and atlantic oceans east of the canadian arctic archipelago though physiographically a part of the continent of north america greenland has been politically and culturally associated with europe specifically norway and denmark the colonial powers as well as the nearby island of iceland for more than a millennium the majority of its residents are inuit whose ancestors began migrating from the canadian mainland in the 13th century gradually settling across the island.ngreenland is the worlds largest island australia and antarctica both larger are generally considered to be continental landmasses rather than islands three-quarters of greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside antarctica with a population of about 56,480 2013 it is the least densely populated territory in the world about a third of the population live in nuuk the capital and largest city the arctic umiaq line ferry acts as a lifeline for western greenland connecting the various cities and settlements.ngreenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by arctic peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now canada norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of greenland beginning in the 10th century having previously settled iceland to escape persecution from the king of norway and his central government these norsemen would later set sail from greenland and iceland with leif erikson becoming the first known european to reach north america nearly 500 years before columbus reached the caribbean islands inuit peoples arrived in the 13th century though under continuous influence of norway and norwegians greenland was not formally under the norwegian crown until 1262 the norse colonies disappeared in the late 15th century when norway was hit by the black death and entered a severe decline soon after their demise beginning in 1499 the portuguese briefly explored and claimed the island naming it terra do lavrador later applied to labrador in canada.nin the early 18th century danish explorers reached greenland again to strengthen trading and power denmarknorway affirmed sovereignty over the island because of norways weak status it lost sovereignty over greenland in 1814 when the union was dissolved greenland became danish in 1814 and was fully integrated in the danish state in 1953 under the constitution of denmark.nin 1973 greenland joined the european economic community with denmark however in a referendum in 1982 a majority of the population voted for greenland to withdraw from the eec which was effected in 1985 greenland contains the worlds largest and most northerly national park northeast greenland national park kalaallit nunaanni nuna eqqissisimatitaq established in 1974 and expanded to its present size in 1988 it protects 972,001 square kilometres 375,292 sq mi of the interior and northeastern coast of greenland and is bigger than all but twenty-nine countries in the world greenland is divided into five municipalities sermersooq kujalleq qeqertalik qeqqata and avannaata greenland does not have an independent seat at the united nations.nin 1979 denmark granted home rule to greenland and in 2008 greenlanders voted in favor of the self-government act which transferred more power from the danish government to the local greenlandic government under the new structure in effect since 21 june 2009 greenland can gradually assume responsibility for policing judicial system company law accounting and auditing mineral resource activities aviation law of legal capacity family law and succession law aliens and border controls the working environment and financial regulation and supervision while the danish government retains control of foreign affairs and defence it also retains control of monetary policy providing an initial annual subsidy of dkk 3.4 billion which is planned to diminish gradually over time greenland expects to grow its economy based on increased income from the extraction of natural resources the capital nuuk held the 2016 arctic winter games at 70 greenland has one of the highest shares of renewable energy in the world mostly coming from hydropower.nncontentsnnnetymologynthe early norse settlers named the island as greenland in the icelandic sagas the norwegian-born icelander erik the red was said to be exiled from iceland for manslaughter along with his extended family and his thralls i.e slaves or serfs he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest after finding a habitable area and settling there he named it grnland translated as greenland supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers the saga of erik the red states in the summer erik left to settle in the country he had found which he called greenland as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name."nthe name of the country in the indigenous greenlandic language is kalaallit nunaat land of the kalaallit the kalaallit are the indigenous greenlandic inuit people who inhabit the countrys western region.nnhistorynmain article history of greenlandnearly paleo-eskimo culturesn maps showing the different cultures in greenland

greenland was home to several successive paleo-eskimo cultures known today primarily through archaeological finds the earliest entry of the paleo-eskimo into greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500 bc from around 2500 bc to 800 bc southern and western greenland were inhabited by the saqqaq culture most finds of saqqaq-period archaeological remains have been around disko bay including the site of saqqaq after which the culture is named.nfrom 2400 bc to 1300 bc the independence i culture existed in northern greenland it was a part of the arctic small tool tradition towns including deltaterrasserne started to appear.naround 800 bc the saqqaq culture disappeared and the early dorset culture emerged in western greenland and the independence ii culture in northern greenland the dorset culture was the first culture to extend throughout the greenlandic coastal areas both on the west and east coasts it lasted until the total onset of the thule culture in 1500 ad the dorset culture population lived primarily from hunting of whales and caribou.nnnorse settlementnsee also herjolfsnes norse greenlandnfrom 986 greenlands west coast was settled by icelanders and norwegians through a contingent of 14 boats led by erik the red they formed three settlementsknown as the eastern settlement the western settlement and the middle settlementon fjords near the southwestern-most tip of the island they shared the island with the late dorset culture inhabitants who occupied the northern and western parts and later with the thule culture that entered from the north norse greenlanders submitted to norwegian rule in 1261 under the kingdom of norway 8721397 later the kingdom of norway entered into a personal union with denmark in 1380 and from 1397 was a part of the kalmar union.nn kingittorsuaq runestone from kingittorsuaq island middle agesnerik the reds recruitment of others to settle in greenland has been characterized recently as a land scam the scam and the name portraying greenland as better farm land than in iceland.nthe norse settlements such as brattahl thrived for centuries but disappeared sometime in the 15th century perhaps at the onset of the little ice age apart from some runic inscriptions no contemporary records or historiography survives from the norse settlements medieval norwegian sagas and historical works mention greenlands economy as well as the bishops of gardar and the collection of tithes a chapter in the konungs skuggsj the kings mirror describes norse greenlands exports and imports as well as grain cultivation.nicelandic saga accounts of life in greenland were composed in the 13th century and later and do not constitute primary sources for the history of early norse greenland modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites interpretation of ice core and clam shell data suggests that between 800 and 1300 the regions around the fjords of southern greenland experienced a relatively mild climate several degrees celsius higher than usual in the north atlantic with trees and herbaceous plants growing and livestock being farmed barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th parallel what is verifiable is that the ice cores indicate greenland has had dramatic temperature shifts many times over the past 100,000 years similarly the icelandic book of settlements records famines during the winters in which the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs".nn one of the last contemporary written mentions of the norse greenlanders records a marriage which took place in 1408 in the church of hvalseytoday the best-preserved nordic ruins in greenland.nthese icelandic settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th centuries the demise of the western settlement coincides with a decrease in summer and winter temperatures a study of north atlantic seasonal temperature variability during the little ice age showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning in the late 13th century to early 14th centuryas much as 6 to 8 c 11 to 14 f lower than modern summer temperatures the study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century the eastern settlement was likely abandoned in the early to mid-15th century during this cold period.ntheories drawn from archeological excavations at herjolfsnes in the 1920s suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the norse population was malnourished maybe due to soil erosion resulting from the norsemens destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming turf-cutting and wood-cutting malnutrition may also have resulted from widespread deaths due to pandemic plague the decline in temperatures during the little ice age and armed conflicts with the skrlings norse word for inuit meaning wretches in 1379 the inuit attacked the eastern settlement killed 18 men and captured two boys and a woman recent archeological studies somewhat challenge the general assumption that the norse colonisation had a dramatic negative environmental effect on the vegetation data support traces of a possible norse soil amendment strategy more recent evidence suggests that the norse who never numbered more than about 2,500 gradually abandoned the greenland settlements over the 1400s as walrus ivory the most valuable export from greenland decreased in price due to competition with other sources of higher-quality ivory and that there was actually little evidence of starvation or difficulties.nother theories about the disappearance of the norse settlement have been proposed;nnnthule culture 1300presentn pictures of greenland c 1863nthe thule people are the ancestors of the current greenlandic population no genes from the paleo-eskimos have been found in the present population of greenland the thule culture migrated eastward from what is now known as alaska around 1000 reaching greenland around 1300 the thule culture was the first to introduce to greenland such technological innovations as dog sleds and toggling harpoons.nn15001814nin 1500 king manuel i of portugal sent gaspar corte-real to greenland in search of a northwest passage to asia which according to the treaty of tordesillas was part of portugals sphere of influence in 1501 corte-real returned with his brother miguel corte-real finding the sea frozen they headed south and arrived in labrador and newfoundland upon the brothers return to portugal the cartographic information supplied by corte-real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to ercole i deste duke of ferrara by alberto cantino in 1502 the cantino planisphere made in lisbon accurately depicts the southern coastline of greenland.nn a 1747 map based on egedes descriptions and misconceptionsnin 16051607 king christian iv of denmark sent a series of expeditions to greenland and arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern norse settlement and assert danish sovereignty over greenland the expeditions were mostly unsuccessful partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult arctic ice and weather conditions and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the eastern settlement on the east coast of greenland just north of cape farewell which is almost inaccessible due to southward drifting ice the pilot on all three trips was english explorer james hall.nn godthb in greenland c 1878nafter the norse settlements died off greenland came under the de facto control of various inuit groups but the danish government never forgot or relinquished the claims to greenland that it had inherited from the norse when it re-established contact with greenland in the early 17th century denmark asserted its sovereignty over the island in 1721 a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by danish-norwegian missionary hans egede was sent to greenland not knowing whether a norse civilization remained there this expedition is part of the dano-norwegian colonization of the americas after 15 years in greenland hans egede left his son paul egede in charge of the mission there and returned to denmark where he established a greenland seminary this new colony was centred at godthb good hope on the southwest coast gradually greenland was opened up to danish merchants and closed to those from other countries.nntreaty of kiel to world war iinmain article greenland in world war iin eirik raudes landnwhen the union between the crowns of denmark and norway was dissolved in 1814 the treaty of kiel severed norways former colonies and left them under the control of the danish monarch norway occupied then-uninhabited eastern greenland as erik the reds land in july 1931 claiming that it constituted terra nullius norway and denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the permanent court of international justice which decided against norway.ngreenlands connection to denmark was severed on 9 april 1940 early in world war ii after denmark was occupied by nazi germany on 8 april 1941 the united states occupied greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by germany the united states occupation of greenland continued until 1945 greenland was able to buy goods from the united states and canada by selling cryolite from the mine at ivittuut the major air bases were bluie west-1 at narsarsuaq and bluie west-8 at sndre strmfjord kangerlussuaq both of which are still used as greenlands major international airports bluie was the military code name for greenland.nduring this war the system of government changed governor eske brun ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances governor aksel svane was transferred to the united states to lead the commission to supply greenland the danish sirius patrol guarded the northeastern shores of greenland in 1942 using dogsleds they detected several german weather stations and alerted american troops who destroyed the facilities after the collapse of the third reich albert speer briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in greenland but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the united states armed forces.ngreenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940 the danish government had maintained a strict monopoly of greenlandic trade allowing only small scale troaking with scottish whalers in wartime greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world despite this change in 1946 a commission including the highest greenlandic council the landsrdene recommended patience and no radical reform of the system two years later the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established a final report g-50 was presented in 1950 greenland was to be a modern welfare state with denmark as sponsor and example in 1953 greenland was made an equal part of the danish kingdom home rule was granted in 1979.nnhome

for 100,000,000 denmark refused to sell it in the 21st century the united states according to wikileaks remains highly interested in investing in the resource base of greenland and in tapping hydrocarbons off the greenlandic coast.nin 1950 denmark agreed to allow the us to reestablish thule air base in greenland it was greatly expanded between 1951 and 1953 as part of a unified nato cold war defense strategy the local population of three nearby villages was moved more than 100 kilometres 62 mi away in the winter the united states tried to construct a subterranean network of secret nuclear missile launch sites in the greenlandic ice cap named project iceworm it managed this project from camp century from 1960 to 1966 before abandoning it as unworkable the danish government did not become aware of the programs mission until 1997 when they discovered it while looking for records related to the crash of a nuclear-equipped b-52 bomber at thule in 1968.nwith the 1953 danish constitution greenlands colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the danish realm as an amt county danish citizenship was extended to greenlanders danish policies toward greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilationor de-greenlandification during this period the danish government promoted the exclusive use of the danish language in official matters and required greenlanders to go to denmark for their post-secondary education many greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern denmark and a number lost their cultural ties to greenland while the policies succeeded in the sense of shifting greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners the greenlandic elite began to reassert a greenlandic cultural identity a movement developed in favour of independence reaching its peak in the 1970s as a consequence of political complications in relation to denmarks entry into the european common market in 1972 denmark began to seek a different status for greenland resulting in the home rule act of 1979.nthis gave greenland limited autonomy with its own legislature taking control of some internal policies while the parliament of denmark maintained full control of external policies security and natural resources the law came into effect on 1 may 1979 the queen of denmark margrethe ii remains greenlands head of state in 1985 greenland left the european economic community eec upon achieving self-rule as it did not agree with the eecs commercial fishing regulations and an eec ban on seal skin products greenland voters approved a referendum on greater autonomy on 25 november 2008 according to one study the 2008 vote created what can be seen as a system between home rule and full independence."non 21 june 2009 greenland gained self-rule with provisions for assuming responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs policing and natural resources also greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law one country two systems denmark maintains control of foreign affairs and defence matters denmark upholds the annual block grant of 3.2 billion danish kroner but as greenland begins to collect revenues of its natural resources the grant will gradually be diminished this is generally considered to be a step toward eventual full independence from denmark

average daily temperature of nuuk greenland varies over the seasons from 8 to 7 c 18 to 45 f the total area of greenland is 2,166,086 km 836,330 sq mi including other offshore minor islands of which the greenland ice sheet covers 1,755,637 km 677,855 sq mi 81 and has a volume of approximately 2,850,000 km 680,000 cu mi the highest point on greenland is gunnbjrn fjeld at 3,700 m 12,139 ft of the watkins range east greenland mountain range the majority of greenland however is less than 1,500 m 4,921 ft in elevation.nthe weight of the ice sheet has depressed the central land area to form a basin lying more than 300 m 984 ft below sea level while elevations rise suddenly and steeply near the coast the ice flows generally to the coast from the centre of the island a survey led by french scientist paul-emile victor in 1951 concluded that under the ice sheet greenland is composed of three large islands this is disputed but if it is so they would be separated by narrow straits reaching the sea at ilulissat icefjord at greenlands grand canyon and south of nordostrundingen.nall towns and settlements of greenland are situated along the ice-free coast with the population being concentrated along the west coast the northeastern part of greenland is not part of any municipality but it is the site of the worlds largest national park northeast greenland national park.nn view of

1950 the northernmost permanent outpost in the world.nn southern greenland is suitable for agriculture hay is harvested in igaliku kujalleq.nthe extreme north of greenland peary land is not covered by an ice sheet because the air there is too dry to produce snow which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet if the greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely the worlds sea level would rise by more than 7 m 23 ft.nbetween 1989 and 1993 us and european climate researchers drilled into the summit of greenlands ice sheet obtaining a pair of 3 km 1.9 mi long ice cores analysis of the layering and chemical composition of the cores has provided a revolutionary new record of climate change in the northern hemisphere going back about 100,000 years and illustrated that the worlds weather and temperature have often shifted rapidly from one seemingly stable state to another with worldwide consequences the glaciers of greenland are also contributing to a rise in the global sea level faster than was previously believed between 1991 and 2004 monitoring of the weather at one location swiss camp showed that the average winter temperature had risen almost 6 c 11 f other research has shown that higher snowfalls from the north atlantic oscillation caused the interior of the ice cap to thicken by an average of 6 cm or 2.36 in/y between 1994 and 2005 however a recent study suggests a much warmer planet in relatively recent geological times:nnnscientists who probed 2 km 1.2 mi through a greenland glacier to recover the oldest plant dna on record said that the planet was far warmer hundreds of thousands of years ago than is generally believed dna of trees plants spiders and insects including butterflies from beneath the southern greenland glacier was estimated to date to 450,000 to 900,000 years ago according to the remnants retrieved from this long-vanished boreal forest that view contrasts sharply with the prevailing one that a lush forest of this kind could not have existed in greenland any later than 2.4 million years ago these dna samples suggest that the temperature probably reached 10 c 50 f in the summer and 17 c 1.4 f in the winter they also indicate that during the last interglacial period 130,000116,000 years ago when local temperatures were on average 5 c 9 f higher than now the glaciers on greenland did not completely melt away.nnn view of kangertittivaq in eastern greenland one of the largest sund-fjord systems in the worldn greenland bedrock at current elevation above sea levelnin 2003 a small island 35 by 15 metres 115 by 49 feet in length and width was discovered by arctic explorer dennis schmitt and his team at the coordinates of 83-42 whether this island is permanent is not confirmed as of yet if it is it is the northernmost permanent known land on earth.nin 2007 the existence of a new island was announced named uunartoq qeqertaq english warming island this island has always been present off the coast of greenland but was covered by a glacier this glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly and by 2007 had completely melted away leaving the exposed island the island was named place of the year by the oxford atlas of the world in 2007 ben keene the atlass editor commented in the last two or three decades global warming has reduced the size of glaciers throughout the arctic and earlier this year news sources confirmed what climate scientists already knew water not rock lay beneath this ice bridge on the east coast of greenland more islets are likely to appear as the sheet of frozen water covering the worlds largest island continues to melt".nsome controversy surrounds the history of the island specifically over whether the island might have been revealed during a brief warm
