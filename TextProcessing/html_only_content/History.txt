term that relates to past events as well as the memory discovery collection organization presentation and interpretation of information about these events scholars who write about history are called historians.nhistory can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present.nstories common to a particular culture but not supported by external sources such as the tales surrounding king arthur are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends because they do not show the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history herodotus a 5th-century bc greek historian is considered within the western tradition to be the father of history and along with his contemporary thucydides helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history their works continue to be read today and the gap between the culture-focused herodotus and the military-focused thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing in east asia a state chronicle the spring and autumn annals was known to be compiled from as early as 722 bc although only 2nd-century bc texts have survived.nancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and

life beginning of the 12th century chronicle account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general 1155 dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events c 1240 body of

a researcher of history is attested from 1531 in all european languages the substantive history is still used to mean both what happened with men and the scholarly study of the happened the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter history or the word historiography.nndescriptionn the title page to the historians history of the worldnhistorians write in the context of their own time and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society in the words of benedetto croce all history is contemporary history history is facilitated by the formation of a true discourse of past through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race the modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.nall events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record the task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past therefore the constitution of the historians archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents by falsifying their claims to represent the true past".nthe study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences it can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas incorporating methodologies from both some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification in the 20th century french historian fernand braudel revolutionized the study of history by using such outside disciplines as economics anthropology and geography in the study of global history.ntraditionally historians have recorded events of the past either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts from the beginning historians have also used such sources as monuments inscriptions and pictures in general the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories what is written what is said and what is physically preserved and historians often consult all three but writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.narchaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects which once unearthed contribute to the study of history but archaeology rarely stands alone it uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries however archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history that is to say archaeology does not fill the gaps within textual sources indeed historical archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources for example mark leone the excavator and interpreter of historical annapolis maryland usa has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment despite the ideology of liberty inherent in written documents at this time.nthere are varieties of ways in which history can be organized including chronologically culturally territorially and thematically these divisions are not mutually exclusive and significant overlaps are often present as in the international womens movement in an age of transition 18301975 it is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general although the modern trend has been toward specialization the area called big history resists this specialization and searches for universal patterns or trends history has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.nnhistory and prehistorynnfurther information protohistorynthe history of the world is the memory of the past experience of homo sapiens sapiens around the world as that experience has been preserved largely in written records by prehistory historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist or where the writing of a culture is not understood by studying painting drawings carvings and other artifacts some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record since the 20th century the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid historys implicit exclusion of certain civilizations such as those of sub-saharan africa and pre-columbian america historians in the west have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the western world in 1961 british historian e h carr wrote:nnthe line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future history begins with the handing down of tradition and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.nnthis definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples such as indigenous australians and new zealand mori in the past and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations even before their contact with european civilization.nnhistoriographynmain article historiographyn the title page to la historia ditalianhistoriography has a number of related meanings firstly it can refer to how history has been produced the story of the development of methodology and practices for example the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis secondly it can refer to what has been produced a specific body of historical writing for example medieval historiography during the 1960s means works of medieval history written during the 1960s thirdly it may refer to why history is produced the philosophy of history as a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives interpretations world view use of evidence or method of presentation of other historians professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.nnphilosophy of historynnmain article philosophy of historynnphilosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance if any of human history furthermore it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its developmentthat is it asks if there is a design purpose directive principle or finality in the processes of human history philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography which is the study of history as an academic discipline and thus concerns its methods and practices and its development as a discipline over time nor should philosophy of history be confused with the history of philosophy which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time.nnhistorical methodsnfurther information historical methodnnthe historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history.nherodotus of halicarnassus 484 bc ca.425 bc has generally been acclaimed as the father of history however his contemporary thucydides c 460 bc c 400 bc is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the history of the peloponnesian war thucydides unlike herodotus regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings and looked at cause and effect rather than as the result of divine intervention in his historical method thucydides emphasized chronology a neutral point of view and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings greek historians also viewed history as cyclical with events regularly recurring.nthere were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval china the groundwork for professional historiography in east asia was established by the han dynasty court historian known as sima qian 14590 bc author of the records of the grand historian shiji for the quality of his written work sima qian is posthumously known as the father of chinese historiography chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in china used his shiji as the official format for historical texts as well as for biographical literature.nsaint augustine was influential in christian and western thought at the beginning of the medieval period through the medieval and renaissance periods history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective around 1800 german philosopher and historian georg wilhelm friedrich hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study.nin the preface to his book the muqaddimah 1377 the arab historian and early sociologist ibn khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed in this criticism he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation the originality of ibn khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation and lastly to feel the need for experience in addition to rational principles in order to assess a culture of the past ibn khaldun often criticized idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data as a result he introduced a scientific method to the study of history and he often referred to it as his new science his historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state communication propaganda and systematic bias in history and he is thus considered to be the father of historiography or the father of the philosophy of history".nin the west historians developed modern methods of historiography in the 17th and 18th centuries especially in france and germany the 19th-century historian with greatest influence on methods was leopold von ranke in germany.nin the 20th century academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives which often tended to glorify the nation or great men to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces a major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art which traditionally had been the case some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included fernand braudel e h carr fritz fischer emmanuel le roy ladurie hans-ulrich wehler bruce trigger marc bloch karl dietrich bracher peter gay robert fogel lucien febvre and lawrence stone many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach braudel combined history with geography bracher history with political science fogel history with economics gay history with psychology trigger history with archaeology while wehler bloch fischer stone febvre and le roy ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology geography anthropology and economics more recently the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship.nin opposition to the claims of history as a social science historians such as hugh trevor-roper john lukacs donald creighton gertrude himmelfarb and gerhard ritter argued that the key to the historians work was the power of the imagination and hence contended that history should be understood as an art french historians associated with the annales school introduced quantitative history using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history cf histoire des mentalits intellectual historians such as herbert butterfield ernst nolte and george mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history american historians motivated by the civil rights era focused on formerly overlooked ethnic racial and socio-economic groups another genre of social history to emerge in the post-wwii era was alltagsgeschichte history of everyday life scholars such as martin broszat ian kershaw and detlev peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century germany especially in the nazi period.nmarxist historians such as eric hobsbawm e p thompson rodney hilton georges lefebvre eugene genovese isaac deutscher c l r james timothy mason herbert aptheker arno j mayer and christopher hill have sought to validate karl marxs theories by analyzing history from a marxist perspective in response to the marxist interpretation of history historians such as franois furet richard pipes j c d clark roland mousnier henry ashby turner and robert conquest have offered anti-marxist interpretations of history feminist historians such as joan wallach scott claudia koonz natalie zemon davis sheila rowbotham gisela bock gerda lerner elizabeth fox-genovese and lynn hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past in recent years postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources in his 1997 book in defence of history richard j evans defended the worth of history another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the australian historian keith windschuttles 1994 book the killing of history.nnmarxian theory of historynmain article marxs theory of historynthe marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time in other words the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfill basic needs such as feeding clothing and housing themselves and their families overall marx and engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in western europe marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the soviet union but since the collapse of communism there in 1991 mikhail krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship.nnareas of studynnperiodsnmain article periodizationnhistorical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time historians give these periods of time names in order to allow organising ideas and classificatory generalisations to be used by historians the names given to a period can vary with geographical location as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past the way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.nnprehistoric periodisationnthe field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists who have entirely different sets of tools and theories the usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past in archaeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology such as the stone age bronze age and iron age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains here prehistory is divided into a series of chapters so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology this narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation there are periodisation however that do not have this narrative aspect relying largely on relative chronology and thus devoid of any specific meaning.ndespite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use in many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it which may be used periodisation however is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop combinedly at periodisation boundaries and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena.nngeographical locationsnparticular geographical locations can form the basis of historical study for example continents countries and cities understanding why historic events took place is important to do this historians often turn to geography according to jules michelet in his book histoire de france 1833 without geographical basis the people the makers of history seem to be walking on air weather patterns the water supply and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there for example to explain why the ancient egyptians developed a successful civilization studying the geography of egypt is essential egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the nile river which flooded each year depositing soil on its banks the rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities that meant everyone did not have to farm so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization there is also the case of climate which historians like ellsworth huntington and allen semple cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament.nnregionsnnmilitary historynmain article military historynmilitary history concerns warfare strategies battles weapons and the psychology of combat the new military history since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals with psychology more than tactics and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture.nnhistory of religionnmain article history of religionsnthe history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries and

sometimes called the new social history is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life in its golden age it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars and still is well represented in history departments in two decades from 1975 to 1995 the proportion of professors of history in american universities identifying with social history rose from 31 to 41 while the proportion of political historians fell from 40 to 30 in the history departments of british universities in 2007 of the 5723 faculty members 1644 29 identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 1425 25%.nthe old social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme and it often included political movements like populism that were social in the sense of being outside the elite system social history was contrasted with political history intellectual history and the history of great men english historian g m trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history reflecting that without social history economic history is barren and political history unintelligible while the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out it has also been defended as history with the people put back in."nnsubfieldsnthe chief subfields

and most sophisticated of historical studies she adds that after 1945 the trend reversed allowing social history to replace it.nneconomic historynmain articles economic history and business

womens history despite its relatively short life gender history and its forerunner womens history has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history since the 1960s when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance it has gone through a number of different phases each with its own challenges and outcomes although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession other influences are more subtle.nnpublic historynmain article public historynpublic history describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation archival science oral history museum curatorship and other related fields the term

intellectual battle took place in britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities at oxford and cambridge scholarship was downplayed professor charles harding firth oxfords regius professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists the oxford tutors who had more votes than the professors fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced britains outstanding statesmen administrators prelates and diplomats and that mission was as valuable as training scholars the tutors dominated the debate until after the second world war it forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools such as manchester university where thomas frederick tout was professionalizing the history undergraduate programme by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis.nin the united states scholarship was concentrated at the major phd-producing universities while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching a tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty furthermore universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.nnnationalismnfrom the origins of national school systems in the 19th century the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority in the united states after world war i a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in western civilization so as to give students a common heritage with europe in the u.s after 1980 attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.nat the university level historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities many view the field from both perspectives.nthe teaching of history in french schools was influenced by the nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the 1960s by cahiers pdagogiques and enseignement and other journals for teachers also influential was the institut national de recherche et de documentation pdagogique inrdp joseph leif the inspector-general of teacher training said pupils children should learn about historians approaches as well as facts and dates louis franois dean of the history/geography group in the inspectorate of national education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote active methods which would give pupils the immense happiness of discovery proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of french patriotism and national identity.nnbias in school teachingn history books in a bookstorenin several countries history textbooks are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism and give students the official line about national enemies.nin many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favourable light for example in japan mention of the nanking massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire second world war is given cursory treatment other countries have complained it was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid marxist historiography.nin the united states especially the southern part history about slavery and the american civil war are controversial topics mcgraw-hill education for example was criticised for describing africans brought to american plantations as workers instead of slaves in a textbook.nacademic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks sometimes with success.nin 21st-century germany the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone and reflects principles formulated by international organizations such as unesco or the council of europe thus oriented towards human rights democracy and peace the result is that german textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy progress human rights peace tolerance and europeanness."nnsee alsonmain articles outline of history and glossary of historynnnmethodsnntopicsnnother themesnnreferencesnnnfurther readingnnexternal linksnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
