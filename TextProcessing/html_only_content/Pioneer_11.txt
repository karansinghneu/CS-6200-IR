pioneer 11 wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnpioneer 11 also known as pioneer g is a 259-kilogram 571 lb robotic space probe launched by nasa on april 6 1973 to study the asteroid belt the environment around jupiter and saturn solar wind and cosmic rays it was the first probe to encounter saturn and the second to fly through the asteroid belt and by jupiter thereafter pioneer 11 became the second of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the solar system due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on september 30 1995 and the last good engineering data was received on november 24 1995.nncontentsnnnmission backgroundeditnhistoryeditnapproved in february 1969 pioneer 11 and its twin probe pioneer 10 were the first to be designed for exploring the outer solar system yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s early mission objectives were defined

pioneer h is currently on display in the milestones of flight exhibit at the national air and space museum in washington d.c many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the voyager program.nnspacecraft designeditnthe pioneer 11 bus measured 36 centimeters 14 in deep and with six 76-centimeter-long 30 in panels forming the hexagonal structure the bus housed propellant to

a year earlier on march 3 1972 pioneer 11 was launched on a trajectory directly aimed at jupiter without any prior gravitational assists in may 1974 pioneer was retargeted to fly past jupiter on a north-south trajectory enabling a saturn flyby in 1979 the maneuver used 17 pounds of propellant lasted 42 minutes and 36 seconds and increased pioneer 11s speed by 230 km/h it also made two mid-course corrections on april 11 1973 and november 7 1974.nnencounter with jupitereditnmain article exploration of jupiternpioneer 11 flew past jupiter in november and december 1974 during its closest approach on december 2 it passed 42,828 kilometers 26,612 mi above the cloud tops the probe obtained detailed images of the great red spot transmitted the first images of the immense polar regions and determined the mass of jupiters moon callisto using the gravitational pull of jupiter a gravity assist was used to alter the trajectory of the probe towards saturn on april 16 1975 following the jupiter encounter the micrometer detector was turned off.nnn media related to pioneer 11 jupiter encounter at wikimedia commonsnsaturn encountereditnpioneer 11 passed by saturn on september 1 1979 at a distance of 21,000 km from saturns cloud tops.nby this time voyager 1 and voyager 2 had already passed jupiter and were also en route to saturn so it was decided to target pioneer 11 to pass through the saturn ring plane at the same position that the soon-to-come voyager probes would use in order to test the route before the voyagers arrived if there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via pioneer thus pioneer 11 was acting as a pioneer in a true sense of the word if danger were detected then the voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings but missing the opportunity to visit uranus and neptune in the process.npioneer 11 imaged and nearly collided with one of saturns small moons passing at a distance of no more than 4,000 kilometers 2,500 mi the object was tentatively identified as epimetheus a moon discovered the previous day from pioneers imaging and suspected from earlier observations by earth-based telescopes after the voyager flybys it became known that there are two similarly-sized moons epimetheus and janus in the same orbit so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of pioneers near-miss pioneer 11 encountered janus on september 1 1979 at 14:52 utc at a distance of 2500 km and mimas at 16:20 utc the same day at 103000 km.nbesides epimetheus instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring charted saturns magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet-size moon titan to be too cold for life hurtling underneath the ring plane the probe sent back pictures of saturns rings the rings which normally seem bright when observed from earth appeared dark in the pioneer pictures and the dark gaps in the rings seen from earth appeared as bright rings.nn media related to pioneer 11 saturn encounter at wikimedia commonsninterstellar missioneditnon february 25 1990 pioneer 11 became the 4th man-made object to pass beyond the orbit of the planets.nnnasa ends operationseditnby 1995 pioneer 11 could no longer power any of its detectors so the decision was made to shut it down on september 29 1995 nasas ames research center responsible for managing the project issued a press release that began after nearly 22 years of exploration out to the farthest reaches of the solar system one of the most durable and productive space missions in history will come to a close it indicated nasa would use its deep space network antennas to listen once or twice a month for the spacecrafts signal until some time in late 1996 when its transmitter will fall silent altogether nasa administrator daniel goldin characterized pioneer 11 as the little spacecraft that could a venerable explorer that has taught us a great deal about the solar system and in the end about our own innate drive to learn pioneer 11 is what nasa is all about exploration beyond the frontier besides announcing the end of operations the dispatch provided a historical list of pioneer 11 mission achievements nasa terminated routine contact with the spacecraft on september 30 1995 but continued to make contact for about 2 hours every 2 to 4 weeks scientists received a few minutes of good engineering data on 24 november 1995 but then lost final contact once earth permanently moved out of view of the spacecrafts antenna its signal became too faint to hear in 2002.nncurrent statuseditn pioneer 10 and 11 speed and distance from the sunnon january 30 2019 pioneer 11 was 100.84 au

two voyager probes launched in 1977 and voyager 1 is now the most distant object built by humans.nnpioneer anomalyeditnmain article pioneer anomalynanalysis of the radio tracking data from the pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft at distances between 2070 au from the sun has consistently indicated the presence of a small but anomalous doppler frequency drift the drift can be interpreted as due to a constant acceleration of 8.74 1.33 10 m/s directed towards the sun although it is suspected that there is a systematic origin to the effect none was found as a result there is sustained interest in the nature of this so-called pioneer anomaly extended analysis of mission data by slava turyshev and colleagues has determined the source of the anomaly to be asymmetric thermal radiation and the resulting thermal recoil force acting on the face of the pioneers away from the sun and in july 2012 the group of researchers published their results in the physical review letters scientific journal.nnpioneer plaqueeditnmain article pioneer plaquenpioneer 10 and 11 both carry a gold-anodized aluminum plaque in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by intelligent lifeforms from
