sporic life cycle.n fresh snow partially covers rough-stalked feather-moss brachythecium rutabulum growing on a thinned hybrid black poplar populus x canadensis the last stage of the moss lifecycle is shown where the sporophytes are visible before dispersion of their spores the calyptra 1 is still attached to the capsule 2 the tops of the gametophytes 3 can be discerned as well inset shows the surrounding black poplars growing on sandy loam on the bank of a kolk with the detail area marked.nin biology a spore is a unit of sexual or asexual reproduction that may be adapted for dispersal and for survival often for extended periods of time in unfavourable conditions spores form part of the life cycles of many plants algae fungi and protozoa bacterial spores are not part of a sexual cycle but are resistant structures used for survival under unfavourable conditions myxozoan spores release amoebulae into their hosts for parasitic infection but also reproduce within the hosts through the pairing of two nuclei within the plasmodium which develops from the amoebula.nspores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium of a diploid sporophyte under favourable conditions the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic division producing a multicellular gametophyte which eventually goes on to produce gametes two gametes fuse to form a zygote which develops into a new sporophyte this cycle is known as alternation of generations.nthe spores of seed plants however are produced internally and the megaspores formed within the ovules and the microspores are involved in the formation of more complex structures that form the dispersal units the seeds and pollen grains.nncontentsnnndefinitioneditnthe term spore derives from the ancient greek word spora meaning seed sowing related to sporos sowing and speirein to sow."nin common parlance the difference between a spore and a gamete both together called gonites is that a spore will germinate and develop into a sporeling while a gamete needs to combine with another gamete to form a zygote before developing further.nthe main difference between spores and seeds as dispersal units is that spores are unicellular while seeds contain within them a multicellular gametophyte that produces a developing embryo the multicellular sporophyte of the next generation spores germinate to give rise to haploid gametophytes while seeds germinate to give rise to diploid sporophytes.nnclassification of spore-producing organismseditnplantseditnvascular plant spores are always haploid vascular plants are either homosporous or isosporous or heterosporous plants that are homosporous produce spores of the same size and type nheterosporous plants such as seed plants spikemosses quillworts and ferns of the order salviniales produce spores of two different sizes the larger spore megaspore in effect functioning as a female spore and the smaller microspore functioning as a male such plants typically give rise to the two kind of spores from within separate sporangia either a megasporangium that produces megaspores or a microsporangium that produces microspores in flowering plants these sporangia occur within the carpel and anthers respectively.nnfungieditnfungi commonly produce spores as a result of sexual or asexual reproduction spores are usually haploid and grow into mature haploid individuals through mitotic division of cells urediniospores and teliospores among rusts are dikaryotic dikaryotic cells result from the fusion of two haploid gamete cells among sporogenic dikaryotic cells karyogamy the fusion of the two haploid nuclei occurs to produce a diploid cell diploid cells undergo meiosis to produce haploid spores.nnclassification of sporeseditnspores can be classified in several ways:nnby spore-producing structureeditn asci of morchella elata containing ascosporesn in plants microspores and in some cases megaspores are formed from all four products of meiosis.n in contrast in many seed plants and heterosporous ferns only a single product of meiosis will become a megaspore macrospore with the rest degenerating.nfungieditnin fungi and fungus-like organisms spores are often classified by the structure in which meiosis and spore production occurs since fungi are often classified according to their spore-producing structures these spores are often characteristic of a particular taxon of the fungi.nnnred algaeeditnnby functioneditnnby origin during life cycleeditnnby mobilityeditnspores can be differentiated by whether they can move or not.nnnanatomyeditnunder high magnification spores can be categorized as either monolete spores or trilete spores in monolete spores there is a single line on the spore indicating the axis on which the mother spore was split into four along a vertical axis in trilete spores all four spores share a common origin and are in contact with each other so when they separate each spore shows three lines radiating from a center pole.nnspore tetrads and trilete sporeseditnmain article evolutionary history of plantsnnenvelope-enclosed spore tetrads are taken as the earliest evidence of plant life on land dating from the mid-ordovician early llanvirn 470 million years ago a period from which no macrofossils have yet been recovered.nindividual trilete spores resembling those of modern cryptogamic plants first appeared in the fossil record at the end of the ordovician period.nndispersaleditnplay media spores being ejected by fungi.nin fungi both asexual and sexual spores or sporangiospores of many fungal species are actively dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures this ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures as well as travelling through the air over long distances many fungi thereby possess specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms as well as spore-surface structures such as hydrophobins for spore ejection these mechanisms include for example forcible discharge of ascospores enabled by the structure of the ascus and accumulation of osmolytes in the fluids of the ascus that lead to explosive discharge of the ascospores into the air.nthe forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water bullers drop which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000 g other fungi rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release such as external mechanical forces exemplified by puffballs attracting insects such as flies to fruiting structures by virtue of their having lively colours and a putrid odour for dispersal of fungal spores is yet another strategy most prominently used by the stinkhorns.nin common smoothcap moss atrichum undulatum the vibration of sporophyte has been shown to be an important mechanism for spore release.nin the case of spore-shedding vascular plants such as ferns wind distribution of very light spores provides great capacity for dispersal also spores are less subject to animal predation than seeds because they contain almost no food reserve however they are more subject to fungal and bacterial predation their chief advantage is that of all forms of progeny spores require the least energy and materials to produce.nin the spikemoss selaginella lepidophylla dispersal is achieved in part by an unusual type of diaspore a tumbleweed.nngalleryeditnnsee alsoeditnnnnnnreferenceseditnnnnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
