analyzernfor many thousands of years astronomers maintained a geocentric world view and did not recognize the existence of a solar system most believed earth was stationary at the center of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky although the greek philosopher aristarchus of samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos nicolaus copernicus in the 16th century developed a mathematically predictive heliocentric system his 17th-century successors galileo galilei johannes kepler and isaac newton developed a modern understanding of physics that led to the gradual acceptance of the idea that earth moves around the sun and that the planets are governed by the same physical laws that govern earth in more recent times this led to the investigation of geological phenomena such as mountains and craters and seasonal meteorological phenomena such as clouds dust storms and ice caps on the other planets.nnantiquity and first observationseditnmain article timeline of solar system astronomynfurther information cosmology and geocentric modelnntelescopic observationseditnsee also timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their moonsn a replica of isaac newtons telescope.nthe first exploration of the solar system was conducted by telescope when astronomers first began to map those objects too faint to be seen with the naked eye.ngalileo was the first to discover physical details about the individual bodies of the solar system he discovered that the moon was cratered that the sun was marked with sunspots and that jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it christiaan huygens followed on from galileos discoveries by discovering saturns moon titan and the shape of the rings of saturn giovanni domenico cassini later discovered four more moons of saturn and the cassini division in saturns rings.nn the sun photographed through a telescope with special solar filter sunspots and limb darkening can be clearly seen mercury is transiting in the lower middle of the suns face.nedmond halley realised in 1705 that repeated sightings of a comet were recording the same object returning regularly once every 7576 years this was the first evidence that anything other than the planets orbited the sun around this time 1704 the term solar system first appeared in english.nin 1781 william herschel was looking for binary stars in the constellation of taurus when he observed what he thought was a new comet its orbit revealed that it was a new planet uranus the first ever discovered.ngiuseppe piazzi discovered ceres in 1801 a small world between mars and jupiter that initially was considered a new planet however subsequent discoveries of thousands of other small worlds in the same region led to their eventual reclassification as asteroids.nby 1846 discrepancies in the orbit of uranus led many to suspect a large planet must be tugging at it from farther out urbain le verriers calculations eventually led to the discovery of neptune the excess perihelion precession of mercurys orbit led le verrier to postulate the intra-mercurian planet vulcan in 1859 but that would turn out to be an irrelevant thesis.nalthough it is debatable when the solar system was truly discovered three 19th century observations determined its nature and place in the universe beyond reasonable doubt first in 1838 friedrich bessel successfully measured a stellar parallax an apparent shift in the position of a star created by earths motion around the sun this was not only the first direct experimental proof of heliocentrism but also revealed for the first time the vast distance between the solar system and the stars then in 1859 robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff using the newly invented spectroscope examined the spectral signature of the sun and discovered that it was composed of the same elements as existed on earth establishing for the first time a physical link between earth and the heavens then father angelo secchi compared the spectral signature of the sun with those of other stars and found them virtually identical the realisation that the sun was a star led to the hypothesis that other stars could have systems of their own though this was not to be proven for nearly 140 years.nn radar-imaging of 2006 dp a small near-earth asteroid that passed by earth in early february 2014nfurther apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets led percival lowell to conclude that yet another planet planet x must lie beyond neptune after his death his lowell observatory conducted a search that ultimately led to clyde tombaughs discovery of pluto in 1930 pluto was however found to be too small to have disrupted the orbits of the outer planets and its discovery was therefore coincidental like ceres it was initially considered to be a planet but after the discovery of many other similarly sized objects in its vicinity it was reclassified in 2006 as a dwarf planet by the iau.nin 1992 the first evidence of a planetary system other than our own was discovered orbiting the pulsar psr b1257+12 three years later 51 pegasi b the first extrasolar planet around a sunlike star was discovered as of 2017 2687 extrasolar systems have been found.nalso in 1992 astronomers david c jewitt of the university of hawaii and jane luu of the massachusetts institute of technology discovered 15760 albion this object proved to be the first of a new population which became known as the kuiper belt an icy analogue to the asteroid belt of which such objects as pluto and charon were deemed a part.nmike brown chad trujillo and david rabinowitz announced the discovery of eris in 2005 a scattered disc object initially thought to be larger than pluto which would make it the largest object discovered in orbit around the sun since neptune new horizons fly-by of pluto in july 2015 resulted in more-accurate measurements of pluto which is slightly larger though less massive than eris.nnobservations by spacecrafteditnmain article timeline of solar system explorationn lineae on europa by galileo spacecraftn timeline of solar system

missions that have been organized and executed by various space agencies.nall planets in the solar system have now been visited to varying degrees by spacecraft launched from earth through these unmanned missions humans have been able to get close-up photographs of all the planets and in the case of landers perform tests of the soils and atmospheres of some.nthe first artificial object sent into space was the soviet satellite sputnik 1 launched in 1957 which successfully orbited earth until 4 january the following year the american probe explorer 6 launched in 1959 was the first satellite to image earth from space.nnflybyseditnthe first successful probe to fly by another solar system body was luna 1 which sped past the moon in 1959 originally meant to impact with the moon it instead missed its target and became the first artificial object to orbit the sun mariner 2 was the first planetary flyby passing venus in 1962 the first successful flyby of mars was made by mariner 4 in 1965 mariner 10 first passed mercury in 1974.nthe first probe to explore the outer planets was pioneer 10 which flew by jupiter in 1973 pioneer 11 was the first to visit saturn in 1979 the voyager probes performed a grand tour of the outer planets following their launch in 1977 with both probes passing jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 1981 voyager 2 then went on to make close approaches to uranus in 1986 and neptune in 1989 the voyager probes are now far beyond neptunes orbit and are on course to find and study the termination shock heliosheath and heliopause according to nasa both voyager probes have encountered the termination shock at a distance of approximately 93 au from the sun.nthe first flyby of a comet occurred in 1985 when the international cometary explorer ice passed by the comet giacobinizinner whereas the first flybys of asteroids were conducted by the galileo space probe which imaged both 951 gaspra in 1991 and 243 ida in 1993 on its way to jupiter.nlaunched on january 19 2006 the new horizons probe is the first man-made spacecraft to explore the kuiper belt this unmanned mission flew by pluto in july 2015 the mission was extended to observe a number of other kuiper belt objects including a close flyby of 486958 2014 mu on new years day 2019.nas of 2011 american scientists are concerned that exploration beyond the asteroid belt will hampered by a

first probe to land on another solar system body was the soviet luna 2 probe which impacted the moon in 1959 since then increasingly distant planets have been reached with probes landing on or impacting the surfaces of venus in 1966 venera 3 mars in 1971 mars 3 although a fully successful landing didnt occur until viking 1 in 1976 the asteroid 433 eros in 2001 near shoemaker and saturns moon titan huygens and the comet tempel 1 deep impact in 2005 the galileo orbiter also dropped a probe into jupiters atmosphere in 1995 because jupiter has no physical surface it was destroyed by increasing temperature and pressure as it descended.nto date only two worlds in the solar system the moon and mars have been visited by mobile rovers the first robotic rover to visit another celestial body was the soviet lunokhod 1 which landed on the moon in 1970 the first to visit another planet was sojourner which travelled 500 metres across the surface of mars in 1997 the only manned rover to visit another world was nasas lunar rover which traveled with apollos 15 16 and 17 between 1971 and 1972.nnspacecraft explorationeditnoverview of some missions to the solar system.nnnnsee also the
