exploration by students this practice was once called vadding at the massachusetts institute of technology though students there now refer to it as roof and tunnel hacking.nsome steam tunnels have dirt floors poor lighting and temperatures upwards of 45 c 113 f others have concrete floors bright light and more moderate temperatures most steam tunnels have large intake fans to bring in fresh air and push the hot air out the back and these fans may start without warning most active steam tunnels do not contain airborne asbestos but proper breathing protection may be required for other respiratory hazards experienced explorers are very cautious inside active utility tunnels since pipes can spew boiling hot water or steam from leaky valves or pressure relief blowoffs frequently there are puddles of muddy water on the floor making slips and falls a special concern near hot pipes.nsteam tunnels have generally been secured more heavily in recent years due to their frequent use for
