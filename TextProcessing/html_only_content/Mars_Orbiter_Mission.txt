mars.nnnnthe mars orbiter mission mom also called mangalyaan mars-craft from sanskrit mangala mars and yna craft vehicle is a space probe orbiting mars since 24 september 2014 it was launched on 5 november 2013 by the indian space research organisation isro it is indias first interplanetary mission and it made it the fourth space agency to reach mars after roscosmos nasa and the european space agency it is the first asian nation to reach mars orbit and the first nation in the world to do so in its first attempt.nthe mars orbiter mission probe lifted-off from the first launch pad at satish dhawan space centre sriharikota range shar andhra pradesh using a polar satellite launch vehicle pslv rocket c25 at 09:08 utc on 5 november 2013 the launch window was approximately 20 days long and started on 28 october 2013 the mom probe spent about a month in earth orbit where it made a series of seven apogee-raising orbital manoeuvres before trans-mars injection on 30 november 2013 utc after a 298-day transit to mars it was inserted into mars orbit on 24 september 2014.nthe mission is a technology demonstrator project to develop the technologies for designing planning management and operations of an interplanetary mission it carries five instruments that will help advance knowledge about mars to achieve its secondary scientific objective the spacecraft is currently being monitored from the spacecraft control centre at isro telemetry tracking and command network istrac in bengaluru with support from the indian deep space network idsn antennae at byalalu karnataka.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnon 23 november 2008 the first public acknowledgement of an unmanned mission to mars was announced by then-isro chairman g madhavan nair the mom mission concept began with a feasibility study in 2010 by the indian institute of space science and technology after the launch of lunar satellite chandrayaan-1 in 2008 prime minister manmohan singh approved the project on 3 august 2012 after the indian space research organisation completed 125 crore us$17 million of required studies for the orbiter the total project cost may be up to 454 crore us$63 million the satellite costs 153 crore us$21 million and the rest of the budget has been attributed to ground stations and relay upgrades that will be used for other isro projects.nthe space agency had planned the launch on 28 october 2013 but was postponed to 5 november following the delay in isros spacecraft tracking ships to take up pre-determined positions due to poor weather in the pacific ocean launch opportunities for a fuel-saving hohmann transfer orbit occur every 26 months in this case the next two would be in 2016 and 2018.nassembly of the pslv-xl launch vehicle designated c25 started on 5 august 2013 the mounting of the five scientific instruments was completed at indian space research organisation satellite centre bengaluru and the finished spacecraft was shipped to sriharikota on 2 october 2013 for integration to the pslv-xl launch vehicle the satellites development was fast-tracked and completed in a record 15 months despite the us federal government shutdown nasa reaffirmed on 5 october 2013 it would provide communications and navigation support to the mission during a meeting on 30 september 2014 nasa and isro officials signed an agreement to establish a pathway for future joint missions to explore mars one of the working groups objectives will be to explore potential coordinated observations and science analysis between the maven orbiter and mom as well as other current and future mars missions.nncosteditnthe total cost of the mission was approximately 450 crore us$73 million making it the least-expensive mars mission to date the low cost of the mission was ascribed by k radhakrishnan the chairman of isro to various factors including a modular approach few ground tests and long 1820 hour working days for scientists bbcs jonathan amos mentioned lower worker costs home-grown technologies simpler design and a significantly less complicated payload than nasas maven.nnmission objectiveseditn artists rendering of the mars orbiter mission spacecraft

ground stations at sriharikota port blair brunei and biak in indonesia and after the spacecrafts apogee became more than 100,000 km an 18 m 59 ft and a 32 m 105 ft diameter antenna of the indian deep space network were utilised the 18 m 59 ft dish antenna was used for communication with the craft until april 2014 after which the larger 32 m 105 ft antenna was used nasas deep space network is providing position data through its three stations located in canberra madrid and goldstone on the us west coast during the non-visible period of isros network the south african national space agencys sansa hartebeesthoek hbk ground station is also providing satellite tracking telemetry and command services.nncommunicationseditncommunications are handled by two 230-watt twtas and two coherent transponders the antenna array consists of a low-gain antenna a medium-gain antenna and a high-gain antenna the high-gain antenna system is based on a single 2.2-metre 7 ft 3 in reflector illuminated by a feed at s-band it is used to transmit and receive the telemetry tracking commanding and data to and from the indian deep space network.nnmission profileeditnnlauncheditn launch of the mars orbiter missionnas originally conceived isro was to launch mom on its geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle gslv but as the gslv failed twice in 2010 and isro was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine it was not advisable to wait for the new batch of rockets as that would have delayed the mom project for at least three years isro opted to switch to the less-powerful polar satellite launch vehicle pslv since the pslv was not powerful enough to place mom on a direct-to-mars trajectory the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns to take advantage of the oberth effect to place itself on a trans-mars trajectory.non 19 october 2013 isro chairman k radhakrishnan announced that the launch had to be postponed by a week as a result of a delay of a crucial telemetry ship reaching fiji the launch was rescheduled for 5 november 2013 isros pslv-xl placed the satellite into earth orbit at 09:50 utc on 5 november 2013 with a perigee of 264.1 km 164.1 mi an apogee of 23,903.6 km 14,853.0 mi and inclination of 19.20 degrees with both the antenna and all three sections of the solar panel arrays deployed during the first three orbit raising operations isro progressively tested the spacecraft systems.nthe orbiters dry mass is 500 kg 1,100 lb and it carried 852 kg 1,878 lb of fuel and oxidiser at launch its main engine which is a derivative of the system used on indias communications satellites uses the bipropellant combination monomethylhydrazine and dinitrogen tetroxide to achieve the thrust necessary for escape velocity from earth it was also used to slow down the probe for mars orbit insertion and subsequently for orbit corrections.nnorbit raising manoeuvreseditn orbit trajectory diagram not to scalen animation of mars orbiter missions trajectory from 5 november 2013 to 28 march 2015 mars orbiter mission mars earth sunnseveral orbit raising operations were conducted from the spacecraft control centre scc at the isro telemetry tracking and command network istrac at peenya bengaluru on 6 7 8 10 12 and 16 november by using the spacecrafts on-board propulsion system and a series of perigee burns the first three of the five planned orbit raising manoeuvres were completed with nominal results while the fourth was only partially successful however a subsequent supplementary manoeuvre raised the orbit to the intended altitude aimed for in the original fourth manoeuvre a total of six burns were completed while the spacecraft remained in earth orbit with a seventh burn conducted on 30 november to insert mom into a heliocentric orbit for its transit to mars.nthe first orbit-raising manoeuvre was performed on 6 november 2013 at 19:47 utc when the spacecrafts 440-newton 99 lb liquid engine was fired for 416 seconds with this engine firing the spacecrafts apogee was raised to 28,825 km 17,911 mi with a perigee of 252 km 157 mi.nthe second orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 7 november 2013 at 20:48 utc with a burn time of 570.6 seconds resulting in an apogee of 40,186 km 24,970 mi.nthe third orbit raising manoeuvre was performed on 8 november 2013 at 20:40 utc with a burn time of 707 seconds resulting in an apogee of 71,636 km 44,513 mi.nthe fourth orbit raising manoeuvre starting at 20:36 utc on 10 november 2013 imparted an incremental velocity of 35 m/s 110 ft/s to the spacecraft instead of the planned 135 m/s 440 ft/s as a result of underburn by the motor because of this the apogee was boosted to 78,276 km 48,638 mi instead of the planned 100,000 km 62,000 mi when testing the redundancies built-in for the propulsion system the flow to the liquid engine stopped with consequent reduction in incremental velocity during the fourth orbit burn the primary and redundant coils of the solenoid flow control valve of 440 newton liquid engine and logic for thrust augmentation by the attitude control thrusters were being tested when both primary and redundant coils were energised together during the planned modes the flow to the liquid engine stopped operating both the coils simultaneously is not possible for future operations however they could be operated independently of each other in sequence.nas a result of the fourth planned burn coming up short an additional unscheduled burn was performed on 12 november 2013 that increased the apogee to 118,642 km 73,721 mi a slightly higher altitude than originally intended in the fourth manoeuvre the apogee was raised to 192,874 km 119,846 mi on 15 november 2013 19:57 utc in the final orbit raising manoeuvre.nntrans-mars injectioneditnfurther information trans-mars injectionnon 30 november 2013 at 19:19 utc a 23-minute engine firing initiated the transfer of mom away from earth orbit and on heliocentric trajectory toward mars the probe travelled a distance of 780,000,000 kilometres 480,000,000 mi to reach mars.nntrajectory correction maneuverseditnfour trajectory corrections were originally planned but only three were carried out the first trajectory correction manoeuvre tcm was carried out on 11 december 2013 at 01:00 utc by firing the 22-newton 4.9 lb thrusters for a duration of 40.5 seconds after this event mom was following the designed trajectory so closely that the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned in april 2014 was not required the second trajectory correction manoeuvre was performed on 11 june 2014 at 11:00 utc by firing the spacecrafts 22 newton thrusters for a duration of 16 seconds the third planned trajectory correction manoeuvre was postponed due to the orbiters trajectory closely matching the planned trajectory the third trajectory correction was also a deceleration test 3.9 seconds long on 22 september 2014.nnmars orbit insertioneditn animation of mars orbiter missions trajectory around mars from 1 august 2014 to 1 december 2018 mars orbiter mission marsn pm narendra modi witnesses the
