records modern scholarship has concluded that sogdiana was governed from the satrapy of nearby bactria the satraps were often relatives of the ruling persian kings especially sons who were not designated as the heir apparent sogdiana likely remained under persian control until roughly 400 bc during the reign of artaxerxes ii rebellious states of the persian empire took advantage of the weak artaxerxes ii and some such as egypt were able to regain their independence persias massive loss of central asian territory is widely attributed to the rulers lack of control however unlike egypt which was quickly recaptured by the persian empire sogdiana remained independent until it was conquered by alexander the great when the latter invaded the persian empire pharasmanes an already independent king of khwarezm allied with the macedonians and sent troops to alexander in 329 bc for his war against the scythians of the black sea region even though this anticipated campaign never materialized.nduring the achaemenid period 550330 bc the sogdians lived as a nomadic people much like the neighboring yuezhi who spoke bactrian an indo-iranian language closely related to sogdian and were already engaging in overland trade some of them had also gradually settled the land to engage in agriculture similar to how the yuezhi offered tributary gifts of jade to the emperors of china the sogdians are recorded in persian records as submitting precious gifts of lapis lazuli and carnelian to darius i the persian king of kings although the sogdians were at times independent and living

sogdia temporarily finally the area was occupied by nomads when the scythians and yuezhis overran it around 145 bc from then until about 40 bc the yuezhi tepidly minted coins imitating and still bearing the images of the greco-bactrian kings eucratides i and heliocles i yet soon afterwards they began minting unique coins bearing the faces of their own rulers as a prelude to asserting themselves as a world power under the kushan empire.nthe american historian homer h dubs offered the suggestion that a lost legion from the roman army of crassus that fought at carrhae encountered and even fought a chinese army of the han dynasty in the region:nn in 36 bc a han expedition into central asia west of the jaxartes river apparently encountered and defeated a contingent of roman legionaries the romans may have been the enslaved remnants of crassus army defeated by the parthians and forced to fight on their eastern frontier sogdiana modern bukhara east of the oxus river on the

road they played an active role in the spread of faiths such as manicheism zoroastrianism and buddhism along the silk road the chinese sui shu book of sui describes sogdians as skilled merchants who attracted many foreign traders to their land to engage in commerce they were described by the chinese as born merchants learning their commercial skills at an early age it appears from sources such as documents found by sir aurel stein and others that by the 4th century they may have monopolized trade between india and china a letter written by sogdian merchants dated 313 ad and found in the ruins of a watchtower in gansu was intended to be sent to merchants in samarkand warning them that after liu cong of han zhao sacked luoyang and the jin emperor fled the capital there was no worthwhile business there for indian and sogdian merchants furthermore in 568 ad a turko-sogdian delegation travelled to the roman emperor in constantinople to obtain permission to trade and in the following years commercial activity between the states flourished put simply the sogdians dominated trade along the silk road from the 2nd century bc until the 10th century.nsuyab and talas in modern-day kyrgyzstan were the main sogdian centers in the north that dominated the caravan routes of the 6th to 8th centuries their commercial interests were protected by the resurgent military power of the gktrks whose empire was built on the political power of the ashina clan and economic clout of the sogdians sogdian trade with some interruptions continued into the 9th century for instance camels women girls silver and gold were seized from sogdia during a raid by qapaghan qaghan 692716 ruler of the second turkic khaganate in the 10th century sogdiana was incorporated into the uighur empire which until 840 encompassed northern central asia this khaganate obtained enormous deliveries of silk from tang china in exchange for horses in turn relying on the sogdians to sell much of this silk further west peter b golden writes that the uyghurs not only adopted the writing system and religious faiths of the sogdians such as manichaeism buddhism and christianity but also looked to the sogdians as mentors while gradually replacing them in their roles as silk road traders and purveyors of culture muslim geographers of the 10th century drew upon sogdian records dating to 750840 after the end of the uyghur empire sogdian trade underwent a crisis following the muslim conquest of transoxiana in the 8th century the samanids resumed trade on the northwestern road leading to the khazars and the urals and the northeastern one toward the nearby turkic tribes.nduring the 5th and 6th century many sogdians took up residence in the hexi corridor where they retained autonomy in terms of governance and had a designated official administrator known as a sabao which suggests their importance to the socioeconomic structure of china the sogdian influence on trade in china is also made apparent by a chinese document which lists taxes paid on caravan trade in the turpan region and shows that twenty-nine out of the thirty-five commercial transactions involved sogdian merchants and in thirteen of those cases both the buyer and the seller were sogdian trade goods brought to china included grapes alfalfa and sassanian silverware as well as glass containers mediterranean coral brass buddhist images roman wool cloth and baltic amber these were exchanged for chinese paper copper and silk in the 7th century the chinese buddhist pilgrim xuanzang noted with approval that sogdian boys were taught to read and write at the age of five though their skill was turned to trade disappointing the scholarly xuanzang he also recorded the sogdians working in other capacities such as farmers

subsequent sasanian empire of persia conquered and incorporated sogdia as a satrapy in 260 an inscription dating to the reign of shapur i noting that its limits formed the northeastern sasanian borderlands with the kushan empire however by the 5th century the region was captured by the rival hephthalite empire.nshortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the byzantine empire from china by nestorian christian monks the 6th-century byzantine historian menander protector writes of how the sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of chinese silk with the byzantine empire after forming an alliance with the sasanian ruler khosrow i to defeat the hephthalite empire istmi the gktrk ruler of the turkic khaganate was approached by sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the sassanid king of kings for the privilege of traveling through persian territories in order to trade with the byzantines istmi refused the first request but when he sanctioned the second one and had the sogdian embassy sent to the sassanid king the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned maniah a sogdian diplomat convinced istmi to send an embassy directly to byzantiums capital constantinople which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to byzantine ruler justin ii but also proposed an alliance against sassanid persia justin ii agreed and sent an embassy to the turkic khaganate ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the sogdians.nit appears however that direct trade with the sogdians remained limited in light of the small amount of roman and byzantine coins found in central asian and chinese archaeological sites belonging to this era although roman embassies apparently reached han china from 166 ad onwards and the ancient romans imported han chinese silk while the han-dynasty chinese imported roman glasswares as discovered in their tombs valerie hansen 2012 wrote that no roman coins from the roman republic 50727 bc or the principate 27 bc 330 ad era of the roman empire have been found in china however warwick ball 2016 upends this notion by pointing to a hoard of sixteen roman coins found at xian china formerly changan dated to the reigns of various emperors from tiberius 1437 ad to aurelian 270275 ad the earliest gold solidus coins from the eastern roman empire found in china date to the reign of byzantine emperor theodosius ii r 408450 and altogether only forty-eight of them have been found compared to thirteen-hundred silver coins in xinjiang and the rest of china the use of silver coins in turfan persisted long after the tang campaign against karakhoja and chinese conquest of 640 with a gradual adoption of chinese bronze coinage over the course of the 7th century the fact that these eastern roman coins were almost always found with sasanian persian silver coins and eastern roman gold coins were used more as ceremonial objects like talismans confirms the pre-eminent importance of greater iran in chinese silk road commerce of central asia compared to eastern rome.nnsogdian merchants generals and statesmen of imperial chinaeditnfurther information ethnic groups in chinese history ethnic

women purchasing land with newcomers living there permanently instead of returning to their homelands in sogdiana they were concentrated in large numbers around luoyang and changan but also xiangyang

sogdian presence in north china since that time sogdians continued as active traders in china following the defeat of the rebellion but many of them were compelled to hide their ethnic identity a prominent case was an chongzhang minister of war and duke of liang who in 756 asked emperor suzong of tang to allow him to change his name to li baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader this change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname li.nduring the tang and subsequent five

regions of the world where the sogdians moved in considerable numbers their language made a considerable impact for instance during chinas han dynasty the native name of the tarim basin city-state of loulan was kroraina possibly from greek due to nearby hellenistic influence however centuries later in 664 ad the tang chinese buddhist monk xuanzang labelled it as nafupo which according to dr hisao

revealing aspects of their social and political lives sogdian art has also been instrumental in aiding historians understanding of their religious beliefs for instance it is clear that buddhist

demonstrated by material evidence for instance the discovery of murals depicting votaries making offers before fire-holders and ossuaries from samarkand panjakent and er-kurgan held the bones of the dead in accordance with zoroastrian ritual at turfan sogdian burials shared similar features with traditional chinese practices yet they still retained essential zoroastrian rituals such as allowing the bodies to be picked clean by scavengers before burying the bones in ossuaries they also sacrificed animals to zoroastrian deities including the supreme deity ahura mazda zoroastrianism remained the dominant religion among sogdians until after the islamic conquest when they gradually converted to islam as is shown by richard bulliets conversion curve".nthe sogdian religious texts found in

establishing an annual trade relationship of one million bolts of chinese silk for one hundred thousand horses the uyghurs relied on sogdian merchants to sell much of this silk further west along the silk road a symbiotic relationship that led many uyghurs to adopt manichaeism from the sogdians however evidence of manichaean liturgical and canonical texts of sogdian origin remains fragmentary and sparse compared to their corpus of buddhist writings the uyghurs were also followers of buddhism for instance they can be seen wearing silk robes in the praidhi scenes of the uyghur bezeklik buddhist
