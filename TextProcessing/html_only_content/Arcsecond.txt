very small angles such as astronomy optometry ophthalmology optics navigation land surveying and marksmanship.nto express even smaller angles standard si prefixes can be employed the milliarcsecond mas and microarcsecond as for instance are commonly used in astronomy.nthe number of square arcminutes in a complete sphere is 7008148510660000000148510660 square arcminutes the surface area of a unit sphere in square units divided by the solid angle area subtended by a square arcminute also in square units so that the final result is a dimensionless number.nncontentsnnnsymbols and abbreviationseditnthe standard symbol for marking the arcminute is the prime u+2032 though a single quote u+0027 is commonly used where only ascii characters are permitted one arcminute is thus written 1 it is also abbreviated as arcmin or amin or less commonly the prime with a circumflex over it nthe standard symbol for the arcsecond is the double prime u+2033 though a double quote u+0022 is commonly used where only ascii characters are permitted one arcsecond is thus written 1 it is also abbreviated as arcsec or asec.nnnin celestial navigation seconds of arc are rarely used in calculations the preference usually being for degrees minutes and decimals of a minute for example written as 42 25.32 or 42 25.322 this notation has been carried over into marine gps receivers which normally display latitude and longitude in the latter format by default.nncommon exampleseditnthe full moons average apparent size is about 31 arcminutes or 0.52.nan arcminute is approximately the resolution of the human eye.nan arcsecond is approximately the angle subtended by a u.s dime coin 18 mm at a distance of 4 kilometres about 2.5 mi an arcsecond is also the angle subtended bynnna milliarcsecond is about the size of a dime atop the eiffel tower as seen from new york city.na microarcsecond is about the size of a period at the end of a sentence in the apollo mission manuals left on the moon as seen from earth.na nanoarcsecond is about the size of a penny on neptunes moon triton as observed from earth.nalso notable examples of size in arcseconds are:nnnuseseditnastronomyeditn comparison of angular diameter of the sun moon planets and the international space station true representation of the sizes is achieved when the image is viewed at a distance of 103 times the width of the moon max circle for example if the moon max circle is 10 cm wide on a monitor viewing it from 10.3 m away will show true representation of the sizes.nsince antiquity the arcminute and arcsecond have been used in astronomy in the ecliptic coordinate system latitude and longitude in the horizon system altitude alt and azimuth az and in the equatorial coordinate system declination are all measured in degrees arcminutes and arcseconds the principal exception is right ascension ra in equatorial coordinates which is measured in time units of hours minutes and seconds.nthe arcsecond is also often used to describe small astronomical angles such as the angular diameters of planets e.g the angular diameter of venus which varies between 10 and 60 the proper motion of stars the separation of components of binary star systems and parallax the small change of position of a star in the course of a year or of a solar system body as the earth rotates these small angles may also be written in milliarcseconds mas or thousandths of an arcsecond the unit of distance the parsec named from the parallax of one arc second was developed for such parallax measurements it is the distance at which the mean radius of the earths orbit would subtend an angle of one arcsecond.nthe esa astrometric space probe gaia launched in 2013 can approximate star positions to 7 microarcseconds as.napart from the sun the star with the largest angular diameter from earth is r doradus a red supergiant with a diameter of 0.05 arcsecond because of the effects of atmospheric seeing ground-based telescopes will smear the image of a star to an angular diameter of about 0.5 arcsecond in poor seeing conditions this increases to 1.5 arcseconds or even more the dwarf planet pluto has proven difficult to resolve because its angular diameter is about 0.1 arcsecond.nspace telescopes are not affected by the earths atmosphere but are diffraction limited for example the hubble space telescope can reach an angular size of stars down to about 0.1 techniques exist for improving seeing on the ground adaptive optics for example can produce images around 0.05 arcsecond on a 10 m class telescope.nncartographyeditnminutes and seconds of arc are also used in cartography and navigation at sea level one minute of arc along the equator or a meridian indeed any great circle equals exactly one geographical mile along the earths equator or approximately one nautical mile 1852 meters or 1.15078 statute miles a second of arc one sixtieth of this amount is roughly 30 meters or 100 feet the exact distance varies along meridian arcs because the figure of the earth is slightly oblate bulges a third of a percent at the equator.npositions are traditionally given using degrees minutes and seconds of arcs for latitude the arc north or south of the equator and for longitude the arc east or west of the prime meridian any position on or above the earths reference ellipsoid can be precisely given with this method however when it is inconvenient to use base-60 for minutes and seconds positions are frequently expressed as decimal fractional degrees to an equal amount of precision degrees given to three decimal places 1/70031000000000000001000 of a degree have about 1/4 the precision of degrees-minutes-seconds 1/70033600000000000003600 of a degree and specify locations within about 120 meters or 400 feet.nnproperty cadastral surveyingeditnrelated to cartography property boundary surveying using the metes and bounds system relies on fractions of a degree to describe property lines angles in reference to cardinal directions a boundary mete is described with a beginning reference point the cardinal direction north or south followed by an angle less than 90 degrees and a second cardinal direction and a linear distance the boundary runs the specified linear distance from the beginning point the direction of the distance being determined by rotating the first cardinal direction the specified angle toward the second cardinal direction for example north 65 39 18 west 85.69 feet would describe a line running from the starting point 85.69 feet in a direction 65 39 18 or 65.655 away from north toward the west.nnfirearmseditn example ballistic table for a given 7.6251mm nato load bullet drop and wind drift are shown both in mil and minute of angle.nthe arcminute is commonly found in the firearms industry and literature particularly concerning the accuracy of rifles though the industry refers to it as minute of angle moa it is especially popular with shooters familiar with the imperial measurement system because 1 moa is subtended by a sphere with a diameter of 1.047 inches at 100 yards 2.908 cm at 100 m a traditional distance on u.s target ranges the subtension is linear with the distance for example at 500 yards 1 moa is subtended by a sphere with a diameter of 5.235 inches and at 1000 yards 1 moa is subtended by a sphere with a diameter of 10.47 inches.nsince many modern telescopic sights are adjustable in half 1/2 quarter 1/4 or eighth 1/8 moa increments also known as clicks zeroing and adjustments are made by counting 2 4 and 8 clicks per moa respectively.nfor example if the point of impact is 3 inches high and 1.5 inches left of the point of aim at 100 yards which for instance could be measured by using a spotting scope with a calibrated reticle the scope needs to be adjusted 3 moa down and 1.5 moa right such adjustments are trivial when the scopes adjustment dials have a moa scale printed on them and even figuring the right number of clicks is relatively easy on scopes that click in fractions of moa this makes zeroing and adjustments much easier:nnnanother common system of measurement in firearm scopes is the milliradian zeroing a mil based scope is easy for users familiar with base ten systems the most common adjustment value in mil based scopes is 1/10 mil which approximates moa.nnnone thing to be aware of is that some moa scopes including some higher-end models are calibrated such that an adjustment of 1 moa on the scope knobs corresponds to exactly 1 inch of impact adjustment on a target at 100 yards rather than the mathematically correct 1.047 this is commonly known as the shooters moa smoa or inches per hundred yards iphy while the difference between one true moa and one smoa is less than half of an inch even at 1000 yards this error compounds significantly on longer range shots that may require adjustment upwards of 2030 moa to compensate for the bullet drop if a shot requires an adjustment of 20 moa or more the difference between true moa and smoa will add up to 1 inch or more in competitive target shooting this might mean the difference between a hit and a miss.nthe physical group size equivalent to m minutes of arc can be calculated as follows group size tanm/60 distance in the example previously given for 1 minute of arc and substituting 3,600 inches for 100 yards 3,600 tan1/60 1.047 inches in metric units 1 moa at 100 meters 2.908 centimeters.nsometimes a precision firearms accuracy will be measured in moa this simply means that under ideal conditions i.e no wind match-grade ammo clean barrel and a vise or a benchrest used to eliminate shooter error the gun is capable of producing a group of shots whose center points center-to-center fit into a circle the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc for example a 1 moa rifle should be capable under ideal conditions of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards most higher-end rifles are warrantied by their manufacturer to shoot under a given moa threshold typically 1 moa or better with specific ammunition and no error on the shooters part for example remingtons m24 sniper weapon system is required to shoot 0.8 moa or better or be rejected.nrifle manufacturers and gun magazines often refer to this capability as sub-moa meaning it shoots under 1 moa this means that a single group of 3 to 5 shots at 100 yards or the average of several groups will measure less than 1 moa between the two furthest shots in the group i.e all shots fall within 1 moa if larger samples are taken i.e more shots per group then group size typically increases however this will ultimately average out if a rifle was truly a 1 moa rifle it would be just as likely that two consecutive shots land exactly on top of each other as that they land 1 moa apart for 5 shot groups based on 95 confidence a rifle that normally shoots 1 moa can be expected to shoot groups between 0.58 moa and 1.47 moa although the majority of these groups will be under 1 moa what this means in practice is if a rifle that shoots 1-inch groups on average at 100 yards shoots a group measuring 0.7 inches followed by a group that is 1.3 inches this is not statistically abnormal.nthe metric system counterpart of the moa is the milliradian or mil being equal to one 1000th of the target range laid out on a circle that has the observer as centre and the target range as radius the number of mils on a full such circle therefore always is equal to 2 1000 regardless the target range therefore 1 moa 0.2908 mil this means that an object which spans 1 mil on the reticle is at a range that is in meters equal to the objects size in millimeters e.g an object of 100 mm 1 mrad is 100 meters away so there is no conversion factor required contrary to the moa system a reticle with markings hashes or dots spaced with a one mil apart or a fraction of a mil are collectively called a mil reticle if the markings are round they are called mil-dots.nin the table below conversions from mil to metric values are exact e.g 0.1 mil equals exactly 1 cm at 100 meters while conversions of minutes of arc to both metric and imperial values are approximate.nn comparison of milliradian mil and minute of arc moa.nnvalues in bold face are exact all mil fractions are given in tenths which is more convenient for practical use.nnnhuman visioneditnin humans 20/20 vision is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.na 20/20 letter subtends 5 minutes of arc total.nnmaterialseditnthe deviation from parallelism between two surfaces for instance in optical engineering is usually measured in arcminutes or arcseconds.nin addition arcseconds are sometimes used in rocking curve scan x ray diffraction measurements of high-quality epitaxial thin films.nnmanufacturingeditnsome measurement devices make use of arcminutes and arcseconds to measure angles when the object being measured is too small for direct visual inspection for instance a toolmakers optical comparator will often include an option to measure in minutes and seconds".nnsee
