galaxy filament wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnnin physical cosmology galaxy filaments subtypes supercluster complexes galaxy walls and galaxy sheets are the largest known structures in the universe they are massive thread-like formations with a typical length of 50 to 80 megaparsecs h 163 to 261 million light-years that form the boundaries between large voids in the universe filaments consist of gravitationally bound galaxies parts wherein many galaxies are very close to one another in cosmic terms are called superclusters.nncontentsnnnformationeditnin the standard model of the evolution of the universe galactic filaments form along and follow web-like strings of dark matter it is thought that this dark matter dictates the structure of the universe on the grandest of scales dark matter gravitationally attracts baryonic matter and it is this normal matter that astronomers see forming long thin walls of super-galactic clusters.nndiscoveryeditndiscovery of structures larger than superclusters began in the late-1980s in 1987 astronomer r brent tully of the university of hawaiis institute of astronomy identified what he called the piscescetus supercluster complex in 1989 the cfa2 great wall was discovered followed by the sloan great wall in 2003 on january 11 2013 researchers led by roger clowes of the university of central lancashire announced the discovery of a large quasar group the huge-lqg which dwarfs previously discovered galaxy filaments in size in november 2013 using gamma-ray bursts as reference points astronomers discovered the herculescorona borealis great wall an extremely huge filament measuring more than 10 billion light-years across.nnfilamentseditnfilament subtype of filaments have roughly similar major and minor axes in cross-section along the lengthwise axis.nnnngalaxy wallseditnthe galaxy wall subtype of filaments have a significantly greater major axis than minor axis in cross-section along the lengthwise axis.nnn galaxy filaments walls and voids form web-like structures.nnmap of nearest galaxy wallseditn the universe within 500 million light years showing the nearest galaxy wallsnlarge quasar groupseditnlarge quasar groups lqgs are some of the largest structures known they are theorized to be protohyperclusters/proto-supercluster-complexes/galaxy filament precursors.nnnsupercluster complexeditnnmaps of large-scale distributioneditnnnnnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnfurther readingeditnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
