partial pressure wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchn pressure attributed to a component gas in a mixture nin a mixture of gases each constituent gas has a partial pressure which is the notional pressure of that constituent gas if it alone occupied the entire volume of the original mixture at the same temperature the total pressure of an ideal gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the gases in the mixture.nthe partial pressure of a gas is a measure of thermodynamic activity of the gass molecules gases dissolve diffuse and react according to their partial pressures and not according to their concentrations in gas mixtures or liquids this general property of gases is also true in chemical reactions of gases in biology for example the necessary amount of oxygen for human respiration and the amount that is toxic is set by the partial pressure of oxygen alone this is true across a very wide range of different concentrations of oxygen present in various inhaled breathing gases or dissolved in blood the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases but can also be measured in for example cerebrospinal fluid.nncontentsnnnsymboleditnthe symbol for pressure is usually p or p which may use a subscript to identify the pressure and gas species are also referred to by subscript when combined these subscripts are applied recursively.nexamples:nnndaltons law of partial pressureseditnmain article daltons lawndaltons law expresses the fact that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture this equality arises from the fact that in an ideal gas the molecules are so far apart that they do not interact with each other most actual real-world gases come very close to this ideal for example given an ideal gas mixture of nitrogen n hydrogen h and ammonia nh:nnnn schematic showing the concept of daltons law.nideal gas mixtureseditnideally the ratio of partial pressures equals the ratio of the number of molecules that is the mole fraction of an individual gas component in an ideal gas mixture can be expressed in terms of the components partial pressure or the moles of the component:nnnand the partial pressure of an individual gas component in an ideal gas can be obtained using this expression:nnnnthe mole fraction of a gas component in a gas mixture is equal to the volumetric fraction of that component in a gas mixture.nthe ratio of partial pressures relies on the following isotherm relation:nnnpartial volume amagats law of additive volumeeditnthe partial volume of a particular gas in a mixture is the volume of one component of the gas mixture it is useful in gas mixtures e.g air to focus on one particular gas component e.g oxygen.nit can be approximated both from partial pressure and molar fraction:nnnvapor pressureeditnmain article vapor pressuren a log-lin vapor pressure chart for various liquidsnvapor pressure is the pressure of a vapor in equilibrium with its non-vapor phases i.e liquid or solid most often the term is used to describe a liquids tendency to evaporate it is a measure of the tendency of molecules and atoms to escape from a liquid or a solid a liquids atmospheric pressure boiling point corresponds to the temperature at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the normal boiling point.nthe higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid.nthe vapor pressure chart displayed has graphs of the vapor pressures versus temperatures for a variety of liquids as can be seen in the chart the liquids with the highest vapor pressures have the lowest normal boiling points.nfor example at any given temperature methyl chloride has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart it also has the lowest normal boiling point 24.2 c which is where the vapor pressure curve of methyl chloride the blue line intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere atm of absolute vapor pressure note that at higher altitudes the atmospheric pressure is less than that at sea level so boiling points of liquids are reduced at the top of mount everest the atmospheric pressure is approximately 0.333 atm so by using the graph the boiling point of diethyl ether would be approximately 7.5 c versus 34.6 c at sea level 1 atm.nnequilibrium constants of reactions involving gas mixtureseditnit is possible to work out the equilibrium constant for a chemical reaction involving a mixture of gases given the partial pressure of each gas and the overall reaction formula for a reversible reaction involving gas reactants and gas products such as:nnnthe equilibrium constant of the reaction would be:nnnnfor reversible reactions changes in the total pressure temperature or reactant concentrations will shift the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or left side of the reaction in accordance with le chateliers principle however the reaction kinetics may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift in some cases the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.nnhenrys law and the solubility of gaseseditnmain article henrys lawngases will dissolve in liquids to an extent that is determined by the equilibrium between the undissolved gas and the gas that has dissolved in the liquid called the solvent the equilibrium constant for that equilibrium is:nnnnthe form of the equilibrium constant shows that the concentration of a solute gas in a solution is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas above the solution this statement is known as henrys law and the equilibrium constant is quite often referred to as the henrys law constant.nhenrys law is sometimes written as:nnnwhere is also referred to as the henrys law constant as can be seen by comparing equations 1 and 2 above is the reciprocal of since both may be referred to as the henrys law constant readers of the technical literature must be quite careful to note which version of the henrys law equation is being used.nhenrys law is an approximation that only applies for dilute ideal solutions and for solutions where the liquid solvent does not react chemically with the gas being dissolved.nnin diving breathing gaseseditnin underwater diving the physiological effects of individual component gases of breathing gases is a function of partial pressure.nusing diving terms partial pressure is calculated as:nnnfor the component gas i":nnnfor example at 50 metres 164 ft underwater the total absolute pressure is 6 bar 600 kpa i.e 1 bar of atmospheric pressure 5 bar of water pressure and the partial pressures of the main components of air oxygen 21 by volume and nitrogen approximately 79 by volume are:nnnnthe minimum safe lower limit for the partial pressures of oxygen in a gas mixture is 0.16 bars 16 kpa absolute hypoxia and sudden unconsciousness becomes a problem with an oxygen partial pressure of less than 0.16 bar absolute oxygen toxicity involving convulsions becomes a problem when oxygen partial pressure is too high the noaa diving manual recommends a maximum single exposure of 45 minutes at 1.6 bar absolute of 120 minutes at 1.5 bar absolute of 150 minutes at 1.4 bar absolute of 180 minutes at 1.3 bar absolute and of 210 minutes at 1.2 bar absolute oxygen toxicity becomes a risk when these oxygen partial pressures and exposures are exceeded the partial pressure of oxygen determines the maximum operating depth of a gas mixture.nnarcosis is a problem when breathing gases at high pressure typically the maximum total partial pressure of narcotic gases used when planning for technical diving may be around 4.5 bar absolute based on an equivalent narcotic depth of 35 metres 115 ft.nthe effect of a toxic contaminant such as carbon monoxide in breathing gas is also related to the partial pressure when breathed a mixture which may be relatively safe at the surface could be dangerously toxic at the maximum depth of a dive or a tolerable level of carbon dioxide in the breathing loop of a diving rebreather may be come intolerable within seconds during descent when the partial pressure rapidly increases and could lead to panic or incapacitation of the diver.nnin medicineeditnthe partial pressures of particularly oxygen and carbon dioxide are important parameters in tests of arterial blood gases but can also be measured in for example cerebrospinal fluid.nnnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnnnnn ncategories hidden categories n
