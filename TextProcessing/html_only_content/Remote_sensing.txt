phenomenon without making physical contact with the object and thus in contrast to on-site observation especially the earth remote sensing is used in numerous fields including geography land surveying and most earth science disciplines for example hydrology ecology meteorology oceanography glaciology geology it also has military intelligence commercial economic planning and humanitarian applications.nin current usage the term remote sensing generally refers to the use of satellite or aircraft-based sensor technologies to detect and classify objects on earth including on the surface and in the atmosphere and oceans based on propagated signals e.g electromagnetic radiation it may be split into active remote sensing i.e when a signal is emitted by a satellite or aircraft and its reflection by the object is detected by the sensor and passive remote sensing i.e when the reflection of sunlight is detected by the sensor.nncontentsnnnovervieweditnplay media this video is about how landsat was used to identify areas of conservation in the democratic republic of the congo and how it was used to help map an area called mlw in the north.npassive sensors gather radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors examples of passive remote sensors include film photography infrared charge-coupled devices and radiometers active collection on the other hand emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target radar and lidar are examples of active remote sensing where the time delay between emission and return is measured establishing the location speed and direction of an object.nn illustration of remote sensingnremote sensing makes it possible to collect data of dangerous or inaccessible areas remote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as the amazon basin glacial features in arctic and antarctic regions and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths military collection during the cold war made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.norbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as el nio and other natural long and short term phenomena other uses include different areas of the earth sciences such as natural resource management agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation and national security and overhead ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.nntypes of data acquisition techniqueseditnthe basis for multispectral collection and analysis is that of examined areas or objects that reflect or emit radiation that stand out from surrounding areas for a summary of major remote sensing satellite systems see the overview table.nnapplications of remote sensingeditnfurther information remote sensing geology and remote sensing archaeologynngeodeticeditnnacoustic and near-acousticeditnnto coordinate a series of large-scale observations most sensing systems depend on the following platform location and the orientation of the sensor high-end instruments now often use positional information from satellite navigation systems the rotation and orientation is often provided within a degree or two with electronic compasses compasses can measure not just azimuth i e degrees to magnetic north but also altitude degrees above the horizon since the magnetic field curves into the earth at different angles at different latitudes more exact orientations require gyroscopic-aided orientation periodically realigned by different methods including navigation from stars or known benchmarks.nndata processingeditnsee also inverse problemngenerally speaking remote sensing works on the principle of the inverse problem while the object or phenomenon of interest the state may not be directly measured there exists some other variable that can be detected and measured the observation which may be related to the object of interest through a calculation the common analogy given to describe this is trying to determine the type of animal from its footprints for example while it is impossible to directly measure temperatures in the upper atmosphere it is possible to measure the spectral emissions from a known chemical species such as carbon dioxide in that region the frequency of the emissions may then be related via thermodynamics to the temperature in that region.nthe quality of remote sensing data consists of its spatial spectral radiometric and temporal resolutions.nnnin order to create sensor-based maps most remote sensing systems expect to extrapolate sensor data in relation to a reference point including distances between known points on the ground this depends on the type of sensor used for example in conventional photographs distances are accurate in the center of the image with the distortion of measurements increasing the farther you get from the center another factor is that of the platen against which the film is pressed can cause severe errors when photographs are used to measure ground distances the step in which this problem is resolved is called georeferencing and involves computer-aided matching of points in the image typically 30 or more points per image which is extrapolated with the use of an established benchmark warping the image to produce accurate spatial data as of the early 1990s most satellite images are sold fully georeferenced.nin addition images may need to be radiometrically and atmospherically corrected.nnninterpretation is the critical process of making sense of the data the first application was that of aerial photographic collection which used the following process spatial measurement through the use of a light table in both conventional single or stereographic coverage added skills such as the use of photogrammetry the use of photomosaics repeat coverage making use of objects known dimensions in order to detect modifications image analysis is the recently developed automated computer-aided application which is in increasing use.nobject-based image analysis obia is a sub-discipline of giscience devoted to partitioning remote sensing rs imagery into meaningful image-objects and assessing their characteristics through spatial spectral and temporal scale.nold data from remote sensing is often valuable because it may provide the only long-term data for a large extent of geography at the same time the data is often complex to interpret and bulky to store modern systems tend to store the data digitally often with lossless compression the difficulty with this approach is that the data is fragile the format may be archaic and the data may be easy to falsify one of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable ultrafiche usually in typefonts such as ocr-b or as digitized half-tone images ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries with lifetimes of several centuries they can be created copied filed and retrieved by automated systems they are about as compact as archival magnetic media and yet can be read by human beings with minimal standardized equipment.nndata processing levelseditnto facilitate the discussion of data processing in practice several processing levels were first defined in 1986 by nasa as part of its earth observing system and steadily adopted since then both internally at nasa e g and elsewhere e g these definitions are:nnna level 1 data record is the most fundamental i e highest reversible level data record that has significant scientific utility and is the foundation upon which all subsequent data sets are produced level 2 is the first level that is directly usable fornmost scientific applications its value is much greater than the lower levels level 2 data sets tend to be less voluminous than level 1 data because they have been reduced temporally spatially or spectrally level 3 data sets are generally smaller than lower level data sets and thus can be dealt with without incurring a great deal of data handling overhead these data tend to be generally more useful for many applications the regular spatial and temporal organization of level 3 datasets makes it feasible to readily combine data from different sources.nwhile these processing levels are particularly suitable for typical satellite data processing pipelines other data level vocabularies have been defined and may be appropriate for more heterogeneous workflows.nnhistoryeditnn the tr-1 reconnaissance/surveillance aircraftn the 2001 mars odyssey used spectrometers and imagers to hunt for evidence of past or present water and volcanic activity on mars.nthe modern discipline of remote sensing arose with the development of flight the balloonist g tournachon alias nadar made photographs of paris from his balloon in 1858 messenger pigeons kites rockets and unmanned balloons were also used for early images with the exception of balloons these first individual images were not particularly useful for map making or for scientific purposes.nsystematic aerial photography was developed for military surveillance and reconnaissance purposes beginning in world war i and reaching a climax during the cold war with the use of modified combat aircraft such as the p-51 p-38 rb-66 and the f-4c or specifically designed collection platforms such as the u2/tr-1 sr-71 a-5 and the ov-1 series both in overhead and stand-off collection a more recent development is that of increasingly smaller sensor pods such as those used by law enforcement and the military in both manned and unmanned platforms the advantage of this approach is that this requires minimal modification to a given airframe later imaging technologies would include infrared conventional doppler and synthetic aperture radar.nthe development of artificial satellites in the latter half of the 20th century allowed remote sensing to progress to a global scale as of the end of the cold war instrumentation aboard various earth observing and weather satellites such as landsat the nimbus and more recent missions such as radarsat and uars provided global measurements of various data for civil research and military purposes space probes to other planets have also provided the opportunity to conduct remote sensing studies in extraterrestrial environments synthetic aperture radar aboard the magellan spacecraft provided detailed topographic maps of venus while instruments aboard soho allowed studies to be performed on the sun and the solar wind just to name a few examples.nrecent developments include beginning in the 1960s and 1970s with the development of image processing of satellite imagery several research groups in silicon valley including nasa ames research center gte and esl inc developed fourier transform techniques leading to the first notable enhancement of imagery data in 1999 the first commercial satellite ikonos collecting very high resolution imagery was launched.nntraining and educationeditnremote sensing has a growing relevance in the modern information society it represents a key technology as part of the aerospace industry and bears increasing economic relevance new sensors e.g terrasar-x and rapideye are developed constantly and the demand for skilled labour is increasing steadily furthermore remote sensing exceedingly influences everyday life ranging from weather forecasts to reports on climate change or natural disasters as an example 80 of the german students use the services of google earth in 2006 alone the software was downloaded 100 million times but studies have shown that only a fraction of them know more about the data they are working with there exists a huge knowledge gap between the application and the understanding of satellite images.nremote sensing only plays a tangential role in schools regardless of the political claims to strengthen the support for teaching on the subject a lot of the computer software explicitly developed for school lessons has not yet been implemented due to its complexity thereby the subject is either not at all integrated into the curriculum or does not pass the step of an interpretation of analogue images in fact the subject of remote sensing requires a consolidation of physics and mathematics as well as competences in the fields of media and methods apart from the mere visual interpretation of satellite images.nmany teachers have great interest in the subject remote sensing being motivated to integrate this topic into teaching provided that the curriculum is considered in many cases this encouragement fails because of confusing information in order to integrate remote sensing in a sustainable manner organizations like the egu or digital earth encourage the development of learning modules and learning portals examples include fis remote sensing in school lessons geospektiv ychange or spatial discovery to promote media and method qualifications as well as independent learning.nnsoftwareeditnmain article remote sensing softwarenremote sensing data are processed and analyzed with computer software known as a remote sensing application a large number of proprietary and open source applications exist to process remote sensing data remote sensing software

storymaps or a software web-app developed specifically for education e.g desktop leoworks online blif.nnsatelliteseditnfirst satellite uv/vis observations simply showed pictures of thenearths surface and atmosphere such satellite images are still used,nfor instance as input for numerical weather forecast the firstnspectroscopic uv/vis observations started in 1970 on board of the usnresearch satellite nimbus 4 these measurements backscatternultraviolet buv later also called solar buv sbuv operated in nadirngeometry i.e they measured the solar light reflected from the groundnor scattered from the atmosphere like for the dobson instruments alsonthe buv/sbuv instruments measure the intensity in different narrownspectral intervals the intention of these buv/sbuv observations was tondetermine information on the atmospheric o profile since thenpenetration depth into the atmosphere strongly depends on wavelength.nfor example the light at the shortest wavelengths has only seen thenhighest parts of the o layer whereas the longest wavelengths have seennthe total column while in principle the buv/sbuv measurements workednwell they suffered from instrumental instabilities.nthe big breakthrough in uv/vis satellite remote sensing of thenatmosphere took place in 1979 with the launch the total ozone mappingnspectrometer toms on nimbus 7 toms is similar to the buv/sbuvninstrument but measures light at longer wavelengths thus it is onlynsensitive to the total o column instead of theno profile however compared to the buv/sbuv instrumentsnthe toms instruments were much more stable the toms instrument on boardnof nimbus 7 yielded the so far longest global data set on on1979 1992 this period in particular includes the discovery of thenozone hole several further toms instruments have been launched on othernsatellites like the dobson instruments on the ground they yield verynaccurate o total column densities using a relatively simplenmethod besides events of very strong atmospheric sonabsorption and aerosols they are however only sensitive tono.nsince april 1995 the first doas instrument is operating from space thenglobal ozone monitoring experiment gome was launched on the europeannresearch satellite ers-2 like sbuv and toms also gome is a nadirnviewing instrument unlike its predecessor instruments it covers a largenspectral range 240 790 nm at a total of 4096 wavelengths arranged innfour channels with a spectral resolution between 0.2 and 0.4 nm itsnnormal ground pixel size in 320 x 40 km global coverage is achievednafter three days for o profile measurements the intensitiesnat short wavelengths are observed buv/sbuv instruments for thendetermination of the total atmospheric o column thenintensities at larger wavelengths are used toms instruments inncontrast to the limited spectral information of buv/sbuv and tomsninstruments gome spectra yield a surplus of spectral information bynapplying the doas method to these measurements it is thus possible tonretrieve a large variety of atmospheric trace gases the majority ofnwhich are very weak absorbers o no bro oclo,nhcho ho o o so innaddition also other quantities like aerosol absorptions the groundnalbedo or indices characterising the solar cycle can be analysed.nbecause of the high sensitivity of gome it is in particular possible tonmeasure various tropospheric trace gases no bro hcho,nh2o so a further important advantage is that the gomenspectra can be analysed with respect to a spectrum of direct sun light,nwhich contains no atmospheric absorptions therefore in contrast tonground based doas measurements the doas analysis of gome spectra yieldsntotal atmospheric column densities rather than the difference betweenntwo atmospheric spectra.nin march 2002 a second doas satellite instrument the scanning imagingnabsorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography sciamachy wasnlaunched on board of the european research satellite envisat innaddition to gome it measures over a wider wavelength range 240 nm n2380 including also the absorption of several greenhouse gases co,nch no and co in the ir it also operated innadditional viewing modes nadir limb occultation which allows tonderive stratospheric trace gas profiles another advantage is that thenground pixel size for the nadir viewing mode was significantly reducednto 30 x 60 km in a special mode even to 15 x 30 km especially for the observation of tropospheric tracengases this is very important because of the strong spatial gradientsnoccurring for such species the first tropospheric results of sciamachynshowed that it was now possible to identify pollution plumes ofnindividual cities or other big sources.nnsee alsoeditnnnnreferenceseditnnnfurther
