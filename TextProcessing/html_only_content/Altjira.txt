time dream-time is a term devised by early anthropologists to refer to a religion-cultural worldview attributed to australian aboriginal beliefs it was originally used by francis gillen quickly adopted by his colleague baldwin spencer and thereafter popularised by a p elkin who however later revised his views the dreaming is used to represent aboriginal concepts of time out of time or everywhen during which the land was inhabited by ancestral figures often of heroic proportions or with supernatural abilities these figures were often distinct from gods as they did not control the material world and were not worshipped but only revered the concept of the dreamtime has subsequently become widely adopted beyond its original australian context and is now part of global popular culture.nthe term is based on a rendition of the indigenous arandic word alcheringa used by the aranda arunta arrernte people of central australia although it has been argued that it is based on a misunderstanding or mistranslation some scholars suggest that the words meaning is closer to eternal uncreated anthropologist william stanner remarked why the blackfellow thinks of dreaming as the nearest equivalent in english is a puzzle and said that the concept was best understood by non-aboriginal people as a complex of meanings".nby the 1990s dreamtime and the dreaming had acquired their own currency in popular culture based on idealised or fictionalised conceptions of australian mythology since the 1970s dreaming and dream time have also returned from academic usage via popular culture and tourism and are now ubiquitous in the english vocabulary of indigenous australians in a kind of self-fulfilling academic prophecy".nncontentsnnnorigin of the termeditnthe station-master magistrate and amateur ethnographer francis gillen first used the terms in an ethnographical report in 1896 with walter baldwin spencer gillen published a major work native tribes of central australia in 1899 in that work they spoke of the alcheringa as the name applied to the far distant past with which the earliest traditions of the tribe deal five years later in their northern tribes of central australia they gloss the far distant age as the dream times link it to the word alcheri meaning dream and affirm that the term is current also among the kaitish and unmatjera.nnaltjiraeditnearly doubts about the precision of spencer and gillens english gloss were expressed by the german lutheran pastor and missionary carl strehlow in his 1908 book die aranda the arrernte who noted that his arrente contacts explained altjira whose etymology was unknown as an eternal being who had no beginning in the arrernte tongue the proper verb for to dream was altjirerama i.e to see god strehlow theorised that the noun is the somewhat rare word altjirrinja of which spencer and gillen gave a corrupted transcription and a false etymology the native they concluded knows nothing of dreamtime as a designation of a certain period of their history."nstrehlow gives altjira or altjira mara mara meaning good as the arrente word for the eternal creator of the world and humankind strehlow describes him as a tall strong man with red skin long fair hair and emu legs with many red-skinned wives with dog legs and children in strehlows account altjira lives in the sky which is a body of land through which runs the milky way a river.nhowever by the time strehlow was writing his contacts had been converts to christianity for decades and critics suggested that altjira had been used by missionaries as a word for the christian god.nin 1926 spencer conducted a field study to challenge strehlows conclusion about altjira and the implied criticism of gillen and spencers original work spencer found attestations of altjira from the 1890s that used the word to mean associated with past times or eternal not god".nacademic sam gill finds strehlows use of altjira ambiguous sometimes describing a supreme being and sometimes describing a totem being but not necessarily a supreme one he attributes the clash partly to spencers cultural evolutionist beliefs that aboriginal people were at a pre-religion stage of development and thus could not believe in a supreme being while strehlow as a christian missionary found presence of belief in the divine a useful entry point for proselytising.nlinguist david campbell moore is critical of spencer and gillens dreamtime translation concluding:nn"dreamtime was a mistranslation based on an etymological connection between a dream and altjira which held only over a limited geographical domain there was some semantic relationship between altjira and a dream but to imagine that the latter captures the essence of altjira is an illusion.nnother termseditnthe complex of religious beliefs encapsulated by dreamtime is also called:nnnin english anthropologists have variously translated words normally translated as dreamtime or dreaming in a variety of other ways including everywhen world-dawn ancestral past ancestral present ancestral now satirically abiding events or abiding law".nntranslationseditnmost translations of dreamtime into other languages are based on the translation of the word dream examples include espaces de rves in french dream spaces and snivanje in croation a gerund derived from the verb to dream".nnaboriginal beliefs and cultureeditn ku-ring-gai chase-petroglyph via waratah track depicting baiame the creator god and sky father in the dreaming of several aboriginal language groups.n waugals yellow triangles with a black snake in the centre are the official bibbulmun track trailmarkers between kalamunda and albany in western australia the noongar believe that the waugal or wagyl created the swan river and is represented by the darling scarp.nrelated entities are known as mura-mura by the dieri and as tjukurpa in pitjantjatjara.n"dreaming is now also used as a term for a system of totemic symbols so that an indigenous australian may own a specific dreaming such as kangaroo dreaming or shark dreaming or honey ant dreaming or badger dreaming or any combination of dreamings pertinent to their country.nthis is because in dreamtime an individuals entire ancestry exists as one culminating in the idea that all worldly knowledge is accumulated through ones ancestors many indigenous australians also refer to the creation time as the dreaming the dreamtime laid down the patterns of life for the aboriginal people.ncreation is believed to be the work of culture heroes who travelled across a formless land creating sacred sites and significant places of interest in their travels in this way songlines or yiri in the warlpiri language were established some of which could travel right across australia through as many as six to ten different language groupings.nthe dreaming and travelling trails of the spirit beings are the songlines the signs of the spirit beings may be of spiritual essence physical remains such as petrosomatoglyphs of body impressions or footprints among natural and elemental simulacra.n"dreaming existed before the life of the individual begins and continues to exist when the life of the individual ends both before and after life it is believed that this spirit-child exists in the dreaming and is only initiated into life by being born through a mother the spirit of the child is culturally understood to enter the developing fetus during the fifth month of pregnancy when the mother felt the child move in the womb for the first time it was thought that this was the work of the spirit of the land in which the mother then stood upon birth the child is considered to be a special custodian of that part of their country and is taught the stories and songlines of that place as wolf 1994 p 14 states a black fella may regard his totem or the place from which his spirit came as his dreaming he may also regard tribal law as his dreaming."nin the wangga genre the songs and dances express themes related to death and regeneration they are performed publicly with the singer composing from their daily lives or while dreaming of a nyuidj dead spirit.ndreaming stories vary throughout australia with variations on the same theme the meaning and significance of particular places and creatures is wedded to their origin in the dreaming and certain places have a particular potency or dreaming for example the story of how the sun was made is different in new south wales and in western australia stories cover many themes and topics as there are stories about creation of sacred places land people animals and plants law and custom in perth the noongar believe that the darling scarp is the body of the wagyl a serpent being that meandered over the land creating rivers waterways and lakes and who created the swan river in another example the gagudju people of arnhemland for which kakadu national park is named believe that the sandstone escarpment that dominates the parks landscape was created in the dreamtime when ginga the crocodile-man was badly burned during a ceremony and jumped into the water to save himself.nnin popular cultureeditnan early reference is found is richard mckennas 1960s speculative fiction novella fiddlers green which mentions alcheringa the binghi spirit land i.e the aranda concept translated as dream time".nearly 1970s references to the concept include ursula k le guins novella the word for world is forest 1972 and peter weirs films the last wave 1977 and picnic at hanging rock 1975.n"dreamtime became a widely cited concept in popular culture in the 1980s and by the late 1980s was adopted as a clich in new age and feminist spirituality alongside related appeals to other rouseauian natural people such as the native americans idealized in 1960s hippie counterculture.nn1980seditnn1990seditnn2000seditnnsee alsoeditnnnnnoteseditnnncitationseditnnnsourceseditnnnnexternal
