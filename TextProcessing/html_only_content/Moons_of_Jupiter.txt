jupiternnn a montage of jupiter and its four largest moons distance and sizes not to scalenthere are 79 known moons of jupiter this gives jupiter the largest number of moons with reasonably stable orbits of any planet in the solar system the most massive of the moons are the four galilean moons which were independently discovered in 1610 by galileo galilei and simon marius and were the first objects found to orbit a body that was neither earth nor the sun from the end of the 19th century dozens of much smaller jovian moons have been discovered and have received the names of lovers or daughters of the roman god jupiter or his greek equivalent zeus the galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects to orbit jupiter with the remaining 75 known moons and the rings together comprising just 0.003 of the total orbiting mass the orbit and motion of the galilean moons around jupiter as captured by junocam aboard the juno spacecraft.of jupiters moons eight are regular satellites with prograde and nearly circular orbits that are not greatly inclined with respect to jupiters equatorial plane the galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass and so would be considered at least dwarf planets if they were in direct orbit around the sun the other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to jupiter these serve as sources of the dust that makes up jupiters rings the remainder of jupiters moons are irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities these moons were probably captured by jupiter from solar orbits twenty-seven of the irregular satellites have not yet been officially named.ncontentsnnncharacteristicseditnthe physical and orbital characteristics of the moons vary widely the four galileans are all over 3,100 kilometres 1,900 mi in diameter the largest galilean ganymede is the ninth largest object in the solar system after the sun and seven of the planets ganymede being larger than mercury all other jovian moons are less than 250 kilometres 160 mi in diameter with most barely exceeding 5 kilometres 3.1 mi their orbital shapes range from nearly perfectly circular to highly eccentric and inclined and many revolve in the direction opposite to jupiters spin retrograde motion orbital periods range from seven hours taking less time than jupiter does to spin around its axis to some three thousand times more almost three earth years.nnorigin and evolutioneditn the relative masses of the jovian moons those smaller than europa are not visible at this scale and combined would only be visible at 100 magnification.jupiters regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk they may be the remnants of a score of galilean-mass satellites that formed early in jupiters history.nsimulations suggest that while the disk had a relatively high mass at any given moment over time a substantial fraction several tenths of a percent of the mass of jupiter captured from the solar nebula was passed through it however only 2 of the proto-disk mass of jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites thus there may have been several generations of galilean-mass satellites in jupiters early history each generation of moons might have spiraled into jupiter because of drag from the disk with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the solar nebula by the time the present possibly fifth generation formed the disk had thinned so that it no longer greatly interfered with the moons orbits the current galilean moons were still affected falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance with each other which still exists for io europa and ganymede ganymedes larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than europa or io.nthe outer irregular moons are thought to have originated from captured asteroids whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb much of their momentum and thus capture them into orbit many are believed to have broken up by mechanical stresses during capture or afterward by collisions with other small bodies producing the moons we see today.nndiscoveryeditn the galilean moons from left to right in order of increasing distance from jupiter io europa ganymede callisto.nsee also timeline of discovery of solar system planets and their moonsnsome scholars propose that the earliest record of a jovian moon ganymede or callisto is a note by chinese astronomer gan de of an observation around 364 bc.nhowever the first certain observations of jupiters satellites were those of galileo galilei in 1609 by january 1610 he had sighted the four massive galilean moons with his 30 magnification telescope and he published his results in march 1610.nsimon marius had independently discovered the moons one day after galileo although he did not publish his book on the subject until 1614 even so the names marius assigned are used today ganymede callisto io and europa no additional satellites were discovered until e e barnard observed amalthea in 1892.nnwith the aid of telescopic photography further discoveries followed quickly over the course of the 20th century himalia was discovered in 1904 elara in 1905 pasiphae in 1908 sinope in 1914 lysithea and carme in 1938 ananke in 1951 and leda in 1974 jupiter and the galilean moons through a 25 cm 10 in meade lx200 telescope.by the time that the voyager space probes reached jupiter around 1979 13 moons had been discovered not including themisto which had been observed in 1975 but was lost until 2000 due to insufficient initial observation data the voyager spacecraft discovered an additional three inner moons in 1979 metis adrastea and thebe.nno additional moons were discovered for two decades generally during the 1980s and 1990s but between october 1999 and february 2003 researchers found another 34 moons using sensitive ground-based detectors these are tiny moons in long eccentric generally retrograde orbits and averaging 3 km 1.9 mi in diameter with the largest being just 9 km 5.6 mi across all of these moons are thought to have been captured asteroidal or perhaps comet bodies possibly fragmented into several pieces.nby 2015 a total of 15 additional moons were discovered two more were discovered in 2016 by the team led by scott s sheppard at the carnegie institution for science bringing the total to 69 on 17 july 2018 the international astronomical union confirmed that sheppards team discovered ten more moons around jupiter bringing the total number to 79 among these is valetudo which has a prograde orbit but crosses paths with several moons that have retrograde orbits making an eventual collisionat some point on a billions of years timescalelikely.nadditional tiny moons likely exist but remain undiscovered as they are very difficult for astronomers to detect.nn the number of moons known for each of the four outer planets up to july 2018 jupiter currently has 79 known satellites.nnamingeditnmain article naming of moonsn the galilean moons and their orbits around jupiter.nthe galilean moons of jupiter io europa ganymede and callisto were named by simon marius soon after their discovery in 1610 however these names fell out of favor until the 20th century the astronomical literature instead simply referred to jupiter i jupiter ii etc or the first satellite of jupiter jupiters second satellite and so on the names io europa ganymede and callisto became popular in the mid-20th century whereas the rest of the moons remained unnamed and were usually numbered in roman numerals v 5 to xii 12 jupiter v was discovered in 1892 and given the name amalthea by a popular though unofficial convention a name first used by french astronomer camille flammarion.nthe other moons were simply labeled by their roman numeral e.g jupiter ix in the majority of astronomical literature until the 1970s in 1975 the international astronomical unions iau task group for outer solar system nomenclature granted names to satellites vxiii and provided for a formal naming process for future satellites still to be discovered the practice was to name newly discovered moons of jupiter after lovers and favorites of the god jupiter zeus and since 2004 also after their descendants all of jupiters satellites from xxxiv euporie onward are named after daughters of jupiter or zeus except liii dia named after a lover of jupiter and lxii valetudo named after a great-granddaughter of jupiter names ending with a or o are used for prograde irregular satellites the latter for highly inclined satellites and names ending with e are used for retrograde irregulars the most recently confirmed moons jupiter li through lxxii with the exception of jupiter liii dia and jupiter lxii valetudo have not received names.nsome asteroids share the same names as moons of jupiter 9 metis 38 leda 52 europa 85 io 113 amalthea 239 adrastea two more asteroids previously shared the names of jovian moons until spelling differences were made permanent by the iau ganymede and asteroid 1036 ganymed and callisto and asteroid 204 kallisto.nngroupseditn the orbits of jupiters irregular

their highly inclined orbitsnmain article irregular satellitenthe irregular satellites are substantially smaller objects with more distant and eccentric orbits they form families with shared similarities in orbit semi-major axis inclination eccentricity and composition it is believed that these are at least partially collisional families that were created when larger but still small parent bodies were shattered by impacts from asteroids captured by jupiters gravitational field these families bear the names of their largest members the identification of satellite families is tentative but the following are typically listed:nnnnnnn retrograde satellites inclinations vs eccentricities with carmes orange and anankes yellow groups identified data as of 2009.nnnnnlisteditnnnthe moons of jupiter are listed below by orbital period moons massive enough for their surfaces to have collapsed into a spheroid are highlighted in bold these are the four galilean moons which are comparable in size to the moon the other moons are much smaller with the least massive galilean moon being more than 7000 times more massive than the most massive of the other moons the irregular captured moons are shaded light gray when prograde and dark gray when retrograde all orbits are based on the estimated orbit on the julian date 2457000 or 3 september 2017 as several moons of jupiter are currently lost these orbital elements may be only rough approximations as of 2018 seven satellites are considered to be lost these are s/2003 j 2 s/2003 j 4 s/2003 j 9 s/2003 j 10 s/2003 j 12 s/2003 j 16 and s/2003 j 23 a number of other moons have only been observed for a year or two but have decent enough orbits to be easily measurable even in 2018.nnnnexplorationeditnmain articles exploration of jupiter ganymede moon exploration europa moon exploration callisto moon exploration and io moon observational historynthe first spacecraft to visit jupiter were pioneer 10 in 1973 and pioneer 11 a year later taking low-resolution images of the four galilean moons the voyager 1 and voyager 2 probes visited jupiter in 1979 discovering the volcanic activity on io and the presence of water ice on the surface of europa the cassini probe to saturn flew by jupiter in 2000 and collected data on interactions of the galilean moons with jupiters extended atmosphere the new horizons spacecraft flew by jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its satellites orbital parameters.nthe galileo spacecraft was the first to enter orbit around jupiter arriving in 1995 and studying it until 2003 during this period galileo gathered a large amount of information about the jovian system making close approaches to all of the galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath the surfaces of europa ganymede and callisto it also discovered a magnetic field around ganymede.nin 2016 the juno spacecraft imaged the galilean moons from above their orbital plane as it approached jupiter orbit insertion creating a time-lapse movie of their motion.nnsee
