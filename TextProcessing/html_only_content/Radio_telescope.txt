antenna of utr-2 low frequency radio telescope kharkiv region ukraine consists of an array of 2040 cage dipole elements.na radio telescope is a specialized antenna and radio receiver used to receive radio waves from astronomical radio sources in the sky in radio astronomy radio telescopes are the main observing instrument used in radio astronomy which studies the radio frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by astronomical objects just as optical telescopes are the main observing instrument used in traditional optical astronomy which studies the light wave portion of the spectrum coming from astronomical objects radio telescopes are typically large parabolic dish antennas similar to those employed in tracking and communicating with satellites and space probes they may be used singly or linked together electronically in an array unlike optical telescopes radio telescopes can be used in the daytime as well as at night since astronomical radio sources such as planets stars nebulas and galaxies are very far away the radio waves coming from them are extremely weak so radio telescopes require very large antennas to collect enough radio energy to study them and extremely sensitive receiving equipment radio observatories are preferentially located far from major centers of population to avoid electromagnetic interference emi from radio television radar motor vehicles and other manmade electronic devices.nradio waves from space were first detected by engineer karl guthe jansky in 1932 at bell telephone laboratories in holmdel new jersey using an antenna built to study noise in radio receivers the first purpose-built radio telescope was a 9-meter parabolic dish constructed by radio amateur grote reber in his back yard in wheaton illinois in 1937 the sky survey he did with it is often considered the beginning of the field of radio astronomy.nncontentsnnnearly radio telescopeseditn full-size replica of the first radio telescope janskys dipole array preserved at the us national radio astronomy observatory in green bank west virginia.n rebers first dish radio telescope wheaton il 1937nthe first radio antenna used to identify an astronomical radio source was one built by karl guthe jansky an engineer with bell telephone laboratories in 1932 jansky was assigned the job of identifying sources of static that might interfere with radio telephone service janskys antenna was an array of dipoles and reflectors designed to receive short wave radio signals at a frequency of 20.5 mhz wavelength about 14.6 meters it was mounted on a turntable that allowed it to rotate in any direction earning it the name janskys merry-go-round it had a diameter of approximately 100 ft 30 m and stood 20 ft 6 m tall by rotating the antenna the direction of the received interfering radio source static could be pinpointed a small shed to the side of the antenna housed an analog pen-and-paper recording system after recording signals from all directions for several months jansky eventually categorized them into three types of static nearby thunderstorms distant thunderstorms and a faint steady hiss of unknown origin jansky finally determined that the faint hiss repeated on a cycle of 23 hours and 56 minutes this period is the length of an astronomical sidereal day the time it takes any fixed object located on the celestial sphere to come back to the same location in the sky thus jansky suspected that the hiss originated outside of the solar system and by comparing his observations with optical astronomical maps jansky concluded that the radiation was coming from the milky way galaxy and was strongest in the direction of the center of the galaxy in the constellation of sagittarius.nan amateur radio operator grote reber was one of the pioneers of what became known as radio astronomy he built the first parabolic dish radio telescope 9 metres 30 ft in diameter in his back yard in wheaton illinois in 1937 he repeated janskys pioneering work identifying the milky way as the first off-world radio source and he went on to conduct the first sky survey at very high radio frequencies discovering other radio sources the rapid development of radar during world war ii created technology which was applied to radio astronomy after the war and radio astronomy became a branch of astronomy with universities and research institutes constructing large radio telescopes.nntypeseditnthe range of frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum that makes up the radio spectrum is very large this means that the types of antennas that are used as radio telescopes vary widely in design size and configuration at wavelengths of 30 meters to 3 meters 10 mhz 100 mhz they are generally either directional antenna arrays similar to tv antennas or large stationary reflectors with moveable focal points since the wavelengths being observed with these types of antennas are so long the reflector surfaces can be constructed from coarse wire mesh such as chicken wire.n at shorter wavelengths parabolic dish antennas predominate the angular resolution of a dish antenna is determined by the ratio of the diameter of the dish to the wavelength of the radio waves being observed this dictates the dish size a radio telescope needs for a useful resolution radio telescopes that operate at wavelengths of 3 meters to 30 cm 100 mhz to 1 ghz are usually well over 100 meters in diameter telescopes working at wavelengths shorter than 30 cm above 1 ghz range in size from 3 to 90 meters in diameter.nnfrequencieseditnthe increasing use of radio frequencies for communication makes astronomical observations more and more difficult see open spectrum.nnegotiations to defend the frequency allocation for parts of the spectrum most useful for

is the five hundred meter aperture spherical telescope fast completed in 2016 by china the 500-meter-diameter 1,600 ft dish with an area as large as 30 football fields is built into a natural karst depression in the landscape in guizhou province and cannot move the feed antenna is in a cabin suspended above the dish on cables the active dish is composed of 4450 moveable panels controlled by a computer by changing the shape of the dish and moving the feed cabin on its cables the telescope can be steered to point to any region of the sky up to 40 from the zenith although the dish is 500 meters in diameter only a 300-meter circular area on the dish is illuminated by the feed antenna at any given time so the actual effective aperture is 300 meters construction was begun in 2007 and completed july 2016 and the telescope became operational september 25 2016.nthe worlds second largest filled-aperture telescope is the arecibo radio telescope located in arecibo puerto rico another

article astronomical interferometernsee also radio astronomy radio interferometryn the very large array in socorro new mexico an interferometric array formed of 27 parabolic dish telescopes.none of the most notable developments came in 1946 with the introduction of the technique called astronomical interferometry which means combining the signals from multiple antennas so that they simulate a larger antenna in order to achieve greater resolution astronomical radio interferometers usually consist either of arrays of parabolic dishes e.g the one-mile telescope arrays of one-dimensional antennas e.g the molonglo observatory synthesis telescope or two-dimensional arrays of omnidirectional dipoles e.g tony hewishs pulsar array all of the telescopes in the array are widely separated and are usually connected using coaxial cable waveguide optical fiber or other type of transmission line recent advances in the stability of electronic oscillators also now permit interferometry to be carried out by independent recording of the signals at the various antennas and then later correlating the recordings at some central processing facility this process is known as very long baseline interferometry vlbi interferometry does increase the total signal collected but its primary purpose is to vastly increase the resolution through a process called aperture synthesis this technique works by superposing interfering the signal waves from the different telescopes on the principle that waves that coincide with the same phase will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out this creates a combined telescope that is equivalent in resolution though not in sensitivity to a single antenna whose diameter is equal to the spacing of the antennas furthest apart in the array.nn atacama large millimeter array in the atacama desert consisting of 66 12-metre 39 ft and 7-metre 23 ft diameter radio telescopes designed to work at sub-millimeter wavelengthsna high-quality image requires a large number of different separations between telescopes projected separation between any two telescopes as seen from the radio source is called a baseline for example the very large array vla near socorro new mexico has 27 telescopes with 351 independent baselines at once which achieves a resolution of 0.2 arc seconds at 3 cm
