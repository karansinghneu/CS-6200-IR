space research organisation in october 2008 and operated until august 2009 the mission included a lunar orbiter and an impactor india launched the spacecraft using a pslv-xl rocket serial number c11 on 22 october 2008 at 00:52 utc from satish dhawan space centre at sriharikota about 80 km 50 mi north of chennai prime minister atal bihari vajpayee announced the project on course in his independence day speech on 15 august 2003 the mission was a major boost to indias space program as india researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the moon the vehicle was inserted into lunar orbit on 8 november 2008.non 14 november 2008 the moon impact probe separated from the chandrayaan orbiter at 14:36 utc and struck the south pole in a controlled manner making india the fourth country to place its flag on the moon the probe hit near the crater shackleton at 15:01 utc ejecting sub-surface soil that could be analysed for the presence of lunar water ice.nthe estimated cost for the project was 386 crore us$54 million.nthe remote sensing lunar satellite had a mass of 1,380 kg 3,040 lb at launch and 675 kg 1,488 lb in lunar orbit it carried high resolution remote sensing equipment for visible near infrared and soft and hard x-ray frequencies over a two-year period it was intended to survey the lunar surface to produce a complete map of its chemical characteristics and three-dimensional topography the polar regions are of special interest as they might contain ice the lunar mission carried five isro payloads and six payloads from other space agencies including nasa esa and the bulgarian aerospace agency which were carried free of cost among its many achievements was the discovery of widespread presence of water molecules in lunar soil.nafter almost a year the orbiter started suffering from several technical issues including failure of the star sensors and poor thermal shielding chandrayaan stopped sending radio signals about 20:00 utc on 28 august 2009 shortly after which the isro officially declared the mission over chandrayaan operated for 312 days as opposed to the intended two years but the mission achieved 95 of its planned objectives.non 2 july 2016 nasa used ground-based radar systems to relocate chandrayaan-1 in its lunar orbit more than seven years after it shut down repeated observations over the next three months allowed a precise determination of its orbit which varies between 150 and 270 km 93 and 168 mi in altitude every two years.nncontentsnnnhistoryeditnprime minister atal bihari vajpayee announced the chandrayaan project on course in his independence day speech on 15 august 2003 the mission was a major boost to indias space program the idea of an indian scientific mission to the moon was first mooted in 1999 during a meeting of the indian academy of sciences the astronautical society of india carried forward the idea in 2000 soon after the indian space research organisation isro set up the national lunar mission task force which concluded that isro has the technical expertise to carry out an indian mission to the moon in april 2003 over 100 eminent indian scientists in the fields of planetary and space sciences earth sciences physics chemistry astronomy astrophysics and engineering and communication sciences discussed and approved the task force recommendation to launch an indian probe to the moon six months later in november the indian government gave the nod for the mission.nnobjectiveseditnthe mission had the following stated scientific objectives:nnngoalseditnin order to

was launched on 22 october 2008 at 00:52 utc from satish dhawan space centre using the isros 44.4-metre 146 ft tall four-stage pslv launch vehicle chandrayaan-1 was sent to the moon in a series of orbit-increasing manoeuvres around the earth over a period of 21 days as opposed to launching the craft on a direct trajectory to the moon at launch the spacecraft was inserted into geostationary transfer orbit gto with an apogee of 22,860 km 14,200 mi and a perigee of 255 km 158 mi the apogee was increased with a series of five orbit burns conducted over a period of 13 days after launch.nfor the duration of the mission isros telemetry tracking and command network istrac at peenya in bangalore tracked and controlled chandrayaan-1 scientists from india europe and the u.s conducted a high-level review of chandrayaan-1 on 29 january 2009 after the spacecraft completed its first 100 days in space.nnearth orbit burnseditnnnthe first orbit-raising manoeuvre of chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was performed at 03:30 utc on 23 october 2008 when the spacecrafts 440 newton liquid engine was fired for about 18 minutes by commanding the spacecraft from spacecraft control centre scc at isro telemetry tracking and command network istrac at peenya bangalore with this chandrayaan-1s apogee was raised to 37,900 km 23,500 mi and its perigee to 305 km 190 mi in this orbit chandrayaan-1 spacecraft took about 11 hours to go around the earth once.nnnthe second orbit-raising manoeuvre of chandrayaan-1 spacecraft was carried out on 25 october 2008 at 00:18 utc when the spacecrafts engine was fired for about 16 minutes raising its apogee to 74,715 km 46,426 mi and its perigee to 336 km 209 mi thus completing 20 percent of its journey in this orbit chandrayaan-1 spacecraft took about twenty-five and a half hours to go round the earth once this is the first time an indian spacecraft has gone beyond the 36,000 km 22,000 mi high geostationary orbit and reached an altitude more than twice that height.nnnthe third orbit raising manoeuvre was initiated on 26 october 2008 at 01:38 utc when the spacecrafts engine was fired for about nine and a half minutes with this its apogee was raised to 164,600 km 102,300 mi and the perigee to 348 km 216 mi in this orbit chandrayaan-1 took about 73 hours to go around the earth once.nnnthe fourth orbit-raising manoeuvre took place on 29 october 2008 at 02:08 utc when the spacecrafts engine was fired for about three minutes raising its apogee to 267,000 km 166,000 mi and the perigee to 465 km 289 mi this extended its orbit to a distance more than half the way to the moon in this orbit the spacecraft took about six days to go around the earth once.nnnthe fifth and final orbit raising manoeuvre was carried out on 3 november 2008 at 23:26 utc when the spacecrafts engine was fired for about two and a half minutes resulting in chandrayaan-1 entering the lunar transfer trajectory with an apogee of about 380,000 km 240,000 mi.nnlunar orbit insertioneditnnchandrayaan-1 completed the lunar orbit insertion operation on 8 november 2008 at 11:21 utc this manoeuvre involved firing of the liquid engine for 817 seconds about thirteen and half minutes when the spacecraft passed within 500 km 310 mi from the moon the satellite was placed in an elliptical orbit that passed over the polar regions of the moon with 7,502 km 4,662 mi aposelene and 504 km 313 mi periselene the orbital period was estimated to be around 11 hours with the successful completion of this operation india became the sixth nation to put a vehicle in lunar orbit.nnnfirst lunar orbit reduction manoeuvre of chandrayaan-1 was carried out on 9 november 2008 at 14:33 utc during this the engine of the spacecraft was fired for about 57 seconds this reduced the periselene to 200 km 124 mi while aposelene remained unchanged at 7,502 km in this elliptical orbit chandrayaan-1 took about ten and a half hours to circle the moon once.nnnthis manoeuvre was carried out on 10 november 2008 at 16:28 utc resulting in steep decrease in chandrayaan-1s aposelene to 255 km 158 mi and its periselene to 187 km 116 mi during this manoeuvre the engine was fired for about 866 seconds about fourteen and a half minutes chandrayaan-1 took two hours and 16 minutes to go around the moon once in this orbit.nnnthird lunar orbit reduction was carried out by firing the onboard engine for 31 seconds on 11 november 2008 at 13:00 utc this reduced the periselene to 101 km 63 mi while the aposelene remained constant at 255 km in this orbit chandrayaan-1 took two hours and 9 minutes to go around the moon once.nnnchandrayaan-1 spacecraft was placed into a mission-specific lunar polar orbit of 100 km 62 mi above the lunar surface on 12 november 2008 in the final orbit reduction manoeuvre chandrayaan-1s aposelene and periselene were both reduced to 100 km in this orbit chandrayaan-1 takes about two hours to go around the moon once two of the 11 payloadsthe terrain mapping camera tmc and the radiation dose monitor radomwere switched on the tmc acquired images of both the earth and the moon.nnimpact of the mip on the lunar surfaceeditnthe moon impact probe mip crash-landed on the lunar surface on 14 november 2008 15:01 utc near the crater shackleton at the south pole the mip was one of eleven scientific instruments payloads on board chandrayaan-1.nthe mip separated from chandrayaan at 100 km from lunar surface and began its nosedive at 14:36 utc going into free fall for thirty minutes as it fell it kept sending information back to the mother satellite which in turn beamed the information back to earth the altimeter then also began recording measurements to prepare for a rover to land on the lunar surface during a second moon mission.nfollowing the deployment of the mip the other scientific instruments were turned on starting the next phase of the mission.nafter scientific analyses of the received data from the mip the indian space research organisation confirmed the presence of water in the lunar soil and published the finding in a press conference addressed by its then chairman g madhavan nair.nnrise of spacecrafts temperatureeditnisro had reported on 25 november 2008 that chandrayaan-1s temperature had risen above normal to 50 c 122 f scientists said that it was caused by higher than normal temperatures in lunar orbit the temperature was brought down by about 10 c 18 f by rotating the spacecraft about 20 degrees and switching off some of the instruments subsequently isro reported on 27 november 2008 that the spacecraft was operating under normal temperature conditions in subsequent reports isro says since the spacecraft was still recording higher than normal temperatures it would be running only one instrument at a time until january 2009 when lunar orbital temperature conditions are said to stabilize the spacecraft was experiencing high temperature because of radiation from the sun and infrared radiation reflected by the moon.nnmapping of mineralseditnthe mineral content on the lunar surface was mapped with the moon mineralogy mapper m a nasa instrument on board the orbiter the presence of iron was reiterated and changes in rock and mineral composition have been identified the oriental basin region of the moon was mapped and it indicates abundance of iron-bearing minerals such as pyroxene.nin 2018 it was announced that m infrared data had been re-analyzed to confirm the existence of water across wide expanses of the moons polar regions.nnmapping of apollo landing siteseditnisro announced in january 2009 the completion of the mapping of the apollo moon missions landing sites by the orbiter using multiple payloads six of the sites have been mapped including landing sites of apollo 15 and apollo 17.nnimage acquisitioneditnthe craft completed 3,000 orbits acquiring 70,000 images of the lunar surface which many in isro believe is quite a record compared to the lunar flights of other nations isro officials estimated that if more than 40,000 images have been transmitted by chandrayaans cameras in 75 days it worked out to nearly 535 images being sent daily they were first transmitted to indian deep space network at byalalu near bangalore from where they were flashed to isros telemetry tracking and command network istrac at bangalore.nsome of these images have a resolution of down to 5 metres 16 ft providing a sharp and clear picture of the moons surface while many images sent by some of the other missions had only a 100-metre resolution.non 26 november the indigenous terrain mapping camera which was first activated on 29 october 2008 acquired images of peaks and craters this came as a surprise to isro officials because the moon consists mostly of craters.nndetection of x-ray signalseditnthe x-ray signatures of aluminium magnesium and silicon were picked up by the c1xs x-ray camera the signals were picked up during a solar flare that caused an x-ray fluorescence phenomenon the flare that caused the fluorescence was within the lowest c1xs sensitivity range.nnfull earth imageeditnon 25 march 2009 chandrayaan beamed back its first images of the earth in its entirety these images were taken with the tmc previous imaging was done on only one part of the earth the new images show asia parts of africa and australia with india being in the center.nnorbit raised to 200 kmeditnafter the completion of all the major mission objectives the orbit of chandrayaan-1 spacecraft which had been at a height of 100 km 62 mi from the lunar surface since november 2008 was raised to 200 km 124 mi the orbit raising manoeuvres were carried out between 03:30 and 04:30 utc on 19 may 2009 the spacecraft in this higher altitude enabled further studies on orbit perturbations gravitational field variation of the moon and also enabled imaging lunar surface with a wider swath it was later revealed that the true reason for the orbit change was that it was an attempt to keep the temperature of the probe down it was assumed that the temperature of the spacecraft subsystems at 100 km above the moons surface would be around 75 degrees celsius however it was more than 75 degrees and problems started to surface we had to raise the orbit to 200 km."nnattitude sensor failureeditnthe star sensors a device used for pointing attitude determination orientation failed in orbit after nine months of operation afterward the orientation of chandrayaan was determined using a back-up procedure using a two-axis sun sensor and taking a bearing from an earth station this was used to update three axis gyroscopes which enabled spacecraft operations the second failure detected on 16 may was attributed to excessive radiation from the sun.nnradar scanseditnon 21 august 2009 chandrayaan-1 along with the lunar reconnaissance orbiter attempted to perform a bistatic radar experiment using their mini-sar radars to detect the presence of water ice on the lunar surface the attempt was a failure it turned out the chandrayaan-1 radar was not pointed at the moon during the experiment.nthe mini-sar has imaged many of the permanently shadowed regions that exist at both poles of the moon on march 2010 it was reported that the mini-sar on board the chandrayaan-1 had discovered more than 40 permanently darkened craters near the moons north pole which are hypothesized to contain an estimated 600 million metric tonnes of water-ice the radars high cpr is not uniquely diagnostic of either roughness or ice the science team must take into account the environment of the occurrences of high cpr signal to interpret its cause the ice must be relatively pure and at least a couple of meters thick to give this signature the estimated amount of water ice potentially present is comparable to the quantity estimated from the previous mission of lunar prospectors neutron data.nalthough the results are consistent with recent findings of other nasa instruments onboard chandrayaan-1 the moon mineralogy mapper mp3 discovered water molecules in the moons polar regions while water vapour was detected by nasas lunar crater observation and sensing satellite or lcross this observation is not consistent with the presence of thick deposits of nearly pure water ice within a few meters of the lunar surface but it does not rule out the presence of small 10 cm discrete pieces of ice mixed in with the regolith.nnend of the missioneditnthe mission was launched on 22 october 2008 and expected to operate for two years however around 20:00 utc on 28 august 2009 communication with the spacecraft was suddenly lost the probe had operated for 312 days the craft had been expected to remain in orbit for approximately another 1000 days and to crash into the lunar surface in late 2012 although in 2016 it was found to still be in orbit.na member of the science advisory board of chandrayaan-1 said that it is difficult to ascertain reasons for the loss of contact isro chairman madhavan nair said that due to very high radiation power-supply units controlling both the computer systems on board failed snapping the communication connectivity however information released later showed that the power supply supplied by mdi failed due to overheating.nalthough the mission was less than 10 months in duration and less than half the intended two years in length a review by scientists termed the mission successful as it had completed 95 of its primary objectives.nnanalysis of collected dataeditnnchandrayaans moon mineralogy mapper has confirmed the magma ocean hypothesis meaning that the moon was once completely molten.nthe terrain mapping camera on board chandrayaan-1 besides producing more than 70,000 three dimensional images has recorded images of the landing site of u.s spacecraft apollo 15.ntmc and hysi payloads of isro have covered about 70 of the lunar surface while m covered more than 95 of the same and sir-2 has provided high-resolution spectral data on the mineralogy of the moon.nindian space research organisation said interesting data on lunar polar areas was provided by lunar laser ranging instrument llri and high energy x-ray spectrometer hex of isro as well as miniature synthetic aperture radar mini-sar of the usa.nllri covered both the lunar poles and additional lunar regions of interest hex made about 200 orbits over the lunar poles and mini-sar provided complete coverage of both north and south polar regions of the moon.nanother esa payload chandrayaan-1 imaging x-ray spectrometer c1xs detected more than two dozen weak solar flares during the mission duration the bulgarian payload called radiation dose monitor radom was activated on the day of the launch itself and worked until the missions end.nisro said scientists from india and participating agencies expressed satisfaction on the performance of chandrayaan-1 mission as well as the high quality of data sent by the spacecraft.nthey have started formulating science plans based on the data sets obtained from the mission it is expected that in the next few months interesting results about lunar topography mineral and chemical contents of the moon and related aspects are expected to be published.nthe chandrayaan-1 payload has enabled scientists to study the interaction between the solar wind and a planetary body like the moon without a magnetic field.nin its 10-month orbit around the moon chandrayaan-1s x-ray spectrometer c1xs detected titanium confirmed the presence of calcium and gathered the most accurate measurements yet of magnesium aluminium and iron on the lunar surface.nnlunar water discoveryeditn direct evidence of lunar water though chandrayaan-1 chandras altitudinal composition chace output profilen these images show a very young lunar crater on the side of the moon that faces away from earth as viewed by chandrayaan-1s nasa moon mineralogy mapper equipmentnon 18 november 2008 the moon impact probe was released from chandrayaan-1 at a height of 100 km 62 mi during its 25-minute descent chandras altitudinal composition explorer chace recorded evidence of water in 650 mass spectra readings gathered during this time on 24 september 2009 science journal reported that the moon mineralogy mapper m on chandrayaan-1 had detected water ice on the moon but on 25 september 2009 isro announced that the mip another instrument on board chandrayaan-1 had discovered water on the moon just before impact and had discovered it 3 months before nasas m the announcement of this discovery was not made until nasa confirmed it.nm detected absorption features near 2.83.0 m on the surface of the moon for silicate bodies such features are typically attributed to hydroxyl and/or water-bearing materials on the moon the feature is seen as a widely distributed absorption that appears strongest at cooler high latitudes and at several fresh feldspathic craters the general lack of correlation of this feature in sunlit m data with neutron spectrometer h abundance data suggests that the formation and retention of oh and ho is an ongoing surficial process oh/ho production processes may feed polar cold traps and make the lunar regolith a candidate source of volatiles for human exploration.nthe moon mineralogy mapper m an imaging spectrometer was one of the 11 instruments on board chandrayaan-i that came to a premature end on 28 august 2009 m was aimed at providing the first mineral map of the entire lunar surface m data were reanalyzed years later and revealed the most definitive proof to date of the presence of water in shaded regions of craters near the moons north and south poles.nlunar scientists had discussed the possibility of water repositories for decades they are now increasingly confident that the decades-long debate is over a report says the moon in fact has water in all sorts of places not just locked up in minerals but scattered throughout the broken-up surface and potentially in blocks or sheets of ice at depth the results from the chandrayaan mission are also offering a wide array of watery signals."nnlunar water productioneditnmain article lunar waternaccording to european space agency esa scientists the lunar regolith a loose collection of irregular dust grains making up the moons surface absorbs hydrogen nuclei from solar winds interaction between the hydrogen nuclei and oxygen present in the dust grains is expected to produce hydroxyl ho and water h2o.nthe sara sub kev atom reflecting analyser instrument developed by esa and the indian space research organisation was designed and used to study the moons surface composition and solar-wind/surface interactions saras results highlight a mystery not every hydrogen nucleus is absorbed one out of every five rebounds into space combining to form an atom of hydrogen hydrogen shoots off at speeds of around 200 kilometres per second 120 mi/s and escapes without being deflected by the moons weak gravity this knowledge provides timely advice for scientists who are readying esas bepicolombo mission to mercury as that spacecraft will carry two instruments similar to sara.nnlunar caveseditnchandrayaan-1 imaged a lunar rille formed by an ancient lunar lava flow with an uncollapsed segment indicating the presence of a lunar lava tube a type of large cave below the lunar surface the tunnel which was discovered near the lunar equator is an empty volcanic tube measuring about 2 km 1.2 mi in length and 360 m 1,180 ft in width according to a s arya scientist sf of ahmedabad-based space application centre sac this could be a potential site for human settlement on the moon earlier japanese lunar orbiter selene kaguya also recorded evidence for other caves on the moon.nntectonismeditndata from the microwave sensor mini-sar of chandrayaan-1 processed using the image analysis software envi has revealed a good amount of past tectonic activity on the lunar surface the researchers think that the faults and fractures discovered could be features of past interior tectonic activity coupled with meteorite impacts.nnawards

to the public by the end of the year 2010 the data was split into two seasons with the first season going public by the end of 2010 and the second going public by the mid of 2011 the data contained pictures of the moon and also data of chemical and mineral mapping of the lunar surface.nnchandrayaan-2editnmain article chandrayaan-2nisro is currently developing a follow-on mission to chandrayaan named chandrayaan-2 which is scheduled to be launched in januarymarch 2019 the indian space research organisation isro plans to include a lander named vikram and robotic rover as a part of its second chandrayaan mission the rover will be designed to move on wheels on the lunar surface do on-site chemical analysis and send the data to the earth via the chandrayaan-2 orbiter which will be orbiting the moon.nnlunar outposteditnchandrayaans imagery will be used to identify regions of interest that will be explored in detail by the nasa lunar reconnaissance orbiter the interest lies in identifying lunar water on the surface that can be exploited in setting up a future lunar outpost the mini-sar one of the u.s payloads on chandrayaan was used to determine the presence of water ice.nnsee
