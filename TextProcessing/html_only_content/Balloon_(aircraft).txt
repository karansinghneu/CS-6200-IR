brian jones achieved the first non-stop balloon circumnavigation in breitling orbiter 3.nin aeronautics a balloon is an unpowered aerostat which remains aloft or floats due to its buoyancy a balloon may be free moving with the wind or tethered to a fixed point it is distinct from an airship which is a powered aerostat that can propel itself through the air in a controlled manner.nmany balloons have a basket gondola or capsule suspended beneath the main envelope for carrying people or equipment including cameras and telescopes and flight-control mechanisms.nncontentsnnnprincipleseditna balloon is conceptually the simplest of all flying machines the balloon is a fabric envelope filled with a gas that is lighter than the surrounding atmosphere as the entire balloon is less dense than its surroundings it rises taking along with it a basket attached underneath which carries passengers or payload although a balloon has no propulsion system a degree of directional control is possible through making the balloon rise or sink in altitude to find favorable wind directions.nthere are three main types of balloon:nnnboth the hot air or montgolfire balloon and the gas balloon are still in common use montgolfire balloons are relatively inexpensive as they do not require high-grade materials for their envelopes and they are popular for balloonist sport activity.nnhot air balloonseditnmain article hot air balloonn hot air balloons san diegonplay media hot air balloon taking offnthe first balloon which carried passengers used hot air to obtain buoyancy and was built by the brothers josef and etienne montgolfier in annonay france in 1783 the first passenger flight was 19 september 1783 carrying a sheep a duck and a rooster.nthe first tethered manned balloon flight was by a larger montgolfier balloon probably on 15 october 1783 the first free balloon flight was by the same montgolfier balloon on 21 november 1783.nwhen heated air expands so a given volume of space contains less air this makes it lighter and if its lifting power is greater than the weight of the balloon containing it it will lift the balloon upwards a hot air balloon can only stay up while it has fuel for its burner to keep the air hot enough.nthe montgolfiers early hot air balloons used a solid-fuel brazier which proved less practical than the hydrogen balloons that had followed almost immediately and hot air ballooning soon died out.nin the 1950s the convenience and low cost of bottled gas burners led to a revival of hot air ballooning for sport and leisure.nthe height or altitude of a hot air balloon is controlled by turning the burner up or down as needed unlike a gas balloon where ballast weights are often carried so that they can be dropped if the balloon gets too low and in order to land some lifting gas must be vented through a valve.nngas balloonseditnmain article gas balloonna man-carrying balloon using the light gas hydrogen for buoyancy was made by professor jacques charles and flown less than a month after the montgolfier flight on 1 december 1783 gas balloons have greater lift for a given volume so they do not need to be so large and they can also stay up for much longer than hot air so gas balloons dominated ballooning for the next 200 years in the 19th century it was common to use town gas to fill balloons this was not as light as pure hydrogen gas having about half the lifting power but it was much cheaper and readily available.nn gas balloons at the albuquerque international balloon fiestanlight gas balloons are predominant in scientific applications as they are capable of reaching much higher altitudes for much longer periods of time they are generally filled with helium although hydrogen has more lifting power it is explosive in an atmosphere rich in oxygen with a few exceptions scientific balloon missions are unmanned.nthere are two types of light-gas balloons zero-pressure and superpressure zero-pressure balloons are the traditional form of light-gas balloon they are partially inflated with the light gas before launch with the gas pressure the same both inside and outside the balloon as the zero-pressure balloon rises its gas expands to maintain the zero pressure difference and the balloons envelope swells.nat night the gas in a zero-pressure balloon cools and contracts causing the balloon to sink a zero-pressure balloon can only maintain altitude by releasing gas when it goes too high where the expanding gas can threaten to rupture the envelope or releasing ballast when it sinks too low loss of gas and ballast limits the endurance of zero-pressure balloons to a few days.na superpressure balloon in contrast has a tough and inelastic envelope that is filled with light gas to pressure higher than that of the external atmosphere and then sealed the superpressure balloon cannot change size greatly and so maintains a generally constant volume the superpressure balloon maintains an altitude of constant density in the atmosphere and can maintain flight until gas leakage gradually brings it down.nsuperpressure balloons offer flight endurance of months rather than days in fact in typical operation an earth-based superpressure balloon mission is ended by a command from ground control to open the envelope rather than by natural leakage of gas.nhigh-altitude balloons are used as high flying vessels to carry scientific instruments like weather balloons or reach near-space altitudes to take footage or photos of the earth these balloons can fly over 100,000 feet 30.5 km into the air and are designed to burst at a set altitude where the parachute will deploy to safely carry the payload back to earth.ncluster ballooning uses many smaller gas-filled balloons for flight see an introduction to cluster ballooning.nncombination balloonseditnearly hot air balloons could not stay up for very long because they used a lot of fuel while early hydrogen balloons were difficult to take higher or lower as desired because the aeronaut could only vent the gas or drop off ballast a limited number of times piltre de rozier realised that for a long-distance flight such as crossing the english channel the aeronaut would need to make use of the differing wind directions at different altitudes it would be essential therefore to have good control of altitude while still able to stay up for a long time he developed a combination balloon having two gas bags the rozier balloon the upper one held hydrogen and provided most of the steady lift the lower one held hot air and could be quickly heated or cooled to provide the varying lift for good altitude control.nin 1785 piltre de rozier took off in an attempt to fly across the channel but shortly into the flight the hydrogen gas bag caught fire and de rozier did not survive the ensuing accident this earned de rozier the title the first to fly and the first to die".nit wasnt until the 1980s that technology was developed to allow safe operation of the rozier type for example by using non-flammable helium as the lifting gas and several designs have successfully undertaken long-distance flights.nntethering and kite balloonseditnmain article kite balloonn a tethered helium balloon gives the public rides to 500 feet 150 m above the city of bristol england the inset shows detail of the gondola.nas an alternative to free flight a balloon may be tethered to allow reliable take off and landing at the same location some of the earliest balloon flights were tethered for safety and since then balloons have been tethered for many purposes including military observation and aerial barrage meteorological and commercial uses.nthe natural spherical shape of a balloon is unstable in high winds tethered balloons for use in windy conditions are often stabilised by aerodynamic shaping and connecting to the tether by a halter arrangement these are called kite balloons.na kite balloon is distinct from a kytoon which obtains a portion of its lift aerodynamically.nnhistoryeditnmain article history of ballooningnantecedentseditn a modern kongming lanternn bartolomeu de gusmos airship passarola flew in 1709 in

known as kongming lanterns mongolian army studied kongming lanterns from chinese and used it in battle of legnica during mongol invasion of poland this is the first time balloon was known by western world.nin 1709 the portuguese cleric bartolomeu de gusmo made a balloon filled with heated air rise inside a room in lisbon he is also claimed to have built a balloon named passarola big bird and attempted to lift himself from saint george castle in lisbon landing about one kilometre away this claim is not generally recognized by aviation historians outside the portuguese speaking community in
