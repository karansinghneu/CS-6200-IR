many low rolling hills.nhumans have lived in shetland since the mesolithic period the earliest written references to the islands date to roman times the early historic period was dominated by scandinavian influences especially from norway and the islands did not become part of scotland until the 15th century when scotland became part of the kingdom of great britain in 1707 trade with northern europe decreased fishing has continued to be an important aspect of the economy up to the present day the discovery of north sea oil in the 1970s significantly boosted shetlands economy

name for the islands the cat tribe also occupied parts of the northern scottish mainland and their name can be found in caithness and in the gaelic name for sutherland cataibh meaning among the cats".nthe oldest version of the modern name shetland is hetlandensis the latinised adjectival form of the old norse name recorded in a letter from harald count of shetland in 1190 becoming hetland in 1431 after various intermediate transformations it is possible that the pictish cat sound forms part of this norse name it then became hjaltland in the 16th century.nas norn was gradually replaced by scots in the form of the shetland dialect hjaltland became etland the initial letter is the middle scots letter yogh the pronunciation of which is almost identical to the original norn sound hj when the use of the letter yogh was discontinued it was often replaced by the similar-looking letter z hence zetland the form used in the name of the pre-1975 county council this is also the source of the ze postcode used for shetland.nmost of the individual islands have norse names although the derivations of some are obscure and may represent pre-norse possibly pictish or even pre-celtic names or

larger temperature differences between summer and winter with the average highs of regular july days comparable to lerwicks all-time record heat that is around 23 c 73 f further demonstrating the moderating effect of the atlantic ocean in contrast winters are considerably milder than those expected in nearby continental areas even comparable to winter temperatures of many parts of england and wales much further south.nthe general character of the climate is windy and cloudy with at least 2 mm 0.08 in of rain falling on more than 250 days a year average yearly precipitation is 1,003 mm 39.5 in with november and december the wettest months snowfall is usually confined to the period november to february and snow seldom lies on the ground for more than a day less rain falls from april to august although no month receives less than 50 mm 2 in fog is common during summer due to the cooling effect of the sea on mild southerly airflows.nbecause of the islands latitude on clear winter nights the northern lights can sometimes be seen in the sky while in summer there is almost perpetual daylight a state of affairs known locally as the simmer dim annual bright sunshine averages 1110 hours and overcast days are common.nnnprehistoryeditnmain article prehistoric shetlandn the preserved ruins of a wheelhouse and broch at jarlshof described as one of the most remarkable archaeological

of the prehistoric eras and there are over 5,000 archaeological sites all told a midden site at west voe on the south coast of mainland dated to 43204030 bc has provided the first evidence of mesolithic human activity on shetland the same site provides dates for early neolithic activity and finds at scord of brouster in walls have been dated to 3400 bc shetland knives are stone tools that

viking expansion the norse gradually shifting their attention from plundering to invasion shetland was colonised during the late 8th and 9th centuries the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain modern shetlanders have almost identical proportions of scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal genetic ancestry suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.nvikings then used the islands as a base for pirate expeditions to norway and the coasts of mainland scotland in response norwegian king harald hrfagre harald fair hair annexed the northern isles comprising orkney and shetland in 875 rognvald eysteinsson received orkney and shetland from harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in scotland and then passed the earldom on to his brother sigurd the mighty.nthe islands converted to christianity in the late 10th century king olav tryggvasson summoned the jarl sigurd the stout during a visit to orkney and said i order you and all your subjects to be baptised if you refuse ill have you killed on the spot and i swear i will ravage every island with fire and steel unsurprisingly sigurd agreed and the islands became christian at a stroke unusually from c 1100 onwards the norse jarls owed allegiance both to norway and to the scottish crown through their holdings as earls of caithness.nin 1194 when harald maddadsson was earl of orkney and shetland a rebellion broke out against king sverre sigurdsson of norway the yskjeggs island beardies sailed for norway but were beaten in the battle of florvg

century onwards scottish monarchs increasingly sought to take control of the islands surrounding the mainland the process was begun in earnest by alexander ii and was continued by his successor alexander iii this strategy eventually led to an invasion of scotland by haakon haakonsson king of norway his fleet assembled in bressay sound before sailing for scotland after the stalemate of the battle of largs haakon retreated to orkney where he died in december 1263 entertained on his deathbed by recitations of the sagas his death halted any further norwegian expansion in scotland and following this ill-fated expedition the hebrides and mann were yielded to the kingdom of scotland as a result of the 1266 treaty of perth although the scots recognised continuing norwegian sovereignty over orkney and shetland.nnannexation by scotlandeditn james iii and margaret whose betrothal led to shetland passing from norway to scotlandnin the 14th century orkney and shetland remained a

of the houses of angus and st clair on the death of haakon vi in 1380 norway formed a political union with denmark after which the interest of the royal house in the islands declined in 1469 shetland was pledged by christian i in his capacity as king of norway as security against the payment of the dowry of his daughter margaret betrothed to james iii of scotland as the money was never paid the connection with the crown of scotland became permanent in 1470 william sinclair 1st earl of caithness ceded his title to james iii and the following year the northern isles were directly annexed to the crown of scotland an action confirmed by the parliament of scotland in 1472 nonetheless shetlands connection with norway has proved to be enduring.nfrom the early 15th century on the shetlanders sold their goods through the hanseatic league of german merchantmen the hansa would buy shiploads of salted fish wool and butter and import salt cloth beer and other goods the late 16th century and early 17th century were dominated by the influence of the despotic robert stewart earl of orkney who was granted the islands by his half-sister mary queen of scots and his son patrick the latter commenced the building of scalloway castle but after his imprisonment in 1609 the crown annexed orkney and shetland again until 1643 when charles i granted them to william douglas 7th earl of morton these rights were held on and off by the mortons until 1766 when they were sold by james douglas 14th earl of morton to laurence dundas.nn18th and 19th centurieseditn full-rigged ship maella of oslo in bressay sound around 1922nthe trade with the north german towns lasted until the 1707 act of union when high salt duties prevented the german merchants from trading with shetland shetland then went into an economic depression as the local traders were not as skilled in trading salted fish however some local merchant-lairds took up where the german merchants had left off and fitted out their own ships to export fish from shetland to the continent for the independent farmers of shetland this had negative consequences as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.nsmallpox afflicted the islands in the 17th and 18th centuries as it did all of europe but as vaccines became available after 1800 health improved the island was very badly hit by the potato famine of 1846 and the government

them returned home by the late 19th century 90 of all shetland was owned by just 32 people and between 1861 and 1881 more than 8,000 shetlanders emigrated with the passing of the crofters act in 1886 the liberal prime minister william gladstone emancipated crofters from the rule of the landlords the act enabled those who had effectively been landowners serfs to become owner-occupiers of their own small farms by this time fishermen from holland who had traditionally gathered each year off the coast of shetland to fish for herring triggered an industry in the islands that boomed from around 1880 until the 1920s when stocks of the fish began to dwindle the production peaked in 1905 at more than a million barrels of which 708,000 were exported.nn20th centuryeditn leif shetland larsen norwegian
