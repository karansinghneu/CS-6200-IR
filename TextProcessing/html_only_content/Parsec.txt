outside the solar system a parsec is defined as the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one arcsecond which corresponds to 7005648000000000000648000 astronomical units one parsec is equal to about 3.26 light-years 30 trillion km or 19 trillion mi n.b a trillion here means a million million using the current two-legged tripod number system the nearest star proxima centauri is about 1.3 parsecs 4.2 light-years from the sun most of the stars visible to the unaided eye in the night sky are within 500 parsecs of the sun.nthe parsec unit was probably first suggested in 1913 by the british astronomer herbert hall turner named as a portmanteau of the parallax of one arcsecond it was defined to make calculations of astronomical distances from only their raw observational data quick and easy for astronomers partly for this reason it is the unit preferred in astronomy and astrophysics though the light-year remains prominent in popular science texts and common usage although parsecs are used for the shorter distances within the milky way multiples of parsecs are required for the larger scales in the universe including kiloparsecs kpc for the more distant objects within and around the milky way megaparsecs mpc for mid-distance galaxies and gigaparsecs gpc for many quasars and the most distant galaxies.nin august 2015 the iau passed resolution b2 which as part of the definition of a standardized absolute and apparent bolometric magnitude scale mentioned an existing explicit definition of the parsec as exactly 7005648000000000000648000 astronomical units or approximately 70163085677581491373.0856775814913710 metres based on the iau 2012 exact si definition of the astronomical unit this corresponds to the small-angle definition of the parsec found in many contemporary astronomical references.nncontentsnnnhistory and derivationeditnsee also stellar parallaxnthe parsec is defined as being equal to the length of the longer leg of an extremely elongated imaginary right triangle in space the two dimensions on which this triangle is based are its shorter leg of length one astronomical unit the average earth-sun distance and the subtended angle of the vertex opposite that leg measuring one arc second applying the rules of trigonometry to these two values the unit length of the other leg of the triangle the parsec can be derived.none of the oldest methods used by astronomers to calculate the distance to a star is to record the difference in angle between two measurements of the position of the star in the sky the first measurement is taken from the earth on one side of the sun and the second is taken approximately half a year later when the earth is on the opposite side of the sun the distance between the two positions of the earth when the two measurements were taken is twice the distance between the earth and the sun the difference in angle between the two measurements is twice the parallax angle which is formed by lines from the sun and earth to the star at the distant vertex then the distance to the star could be calculated using trigonometry the first successful published direct measurements of an object at interstellar distances were undertaken by german astronomer friedrich wilhelm bessel in 1838 who used this approach to calculate the 3.5-parsec distance of 61 cygni.nn stellar parallax motion from annual parallaxnthe parallax of a star is defined as half of the angular distance that a star appears to move relative to the celestial sphere as earth orbits the sun equivalently it is the subtended angle from that stars perspective of the semimajor axis of the earths orbit the star the sun and the earth form the corners of an imaginary right triangle in space the right angle is the corner at the sun and the corner at the star is the parallax angle the length of the opposite side to the parallax angle is the distance from the earth to the sun defined as one astronomical unit au and the length of the adjacent side gives the distance from the sun to the star therefore given a measurement of the parallax angle along with the rules of trigonometry the distance from the sun to the star can be found a parsec is defined as the length of the side adjacent to the vertex occupied by a star whose parallax angle is one arcsecond.nthe use of the parsec as a unit of distance follows naturally from bessels method because the distance in parsecs can be computed simply as the reciprocal of the parallax angle in arcseconds i.e if the parallax angle is 1 arcsecond the object is 1 pc from the sun if the parallax angle is 0.5 arcseconds the object is 2 pc away etc no trigonometric functions are required in this relationship because the very small angles involved mean that the approximate solution of the skinny triangle can be applied.nthough it may have been used before the term parsec was first mentioned in an astronomical publication in 1913 astronomer royal frank watson dyson expressed his concern for the need of a name for that unit of distance he proposed the name astron but mentioned that carl charlier had suggested siriometer and herbert hall turner had proposed parsec it was turners proposal that stuck.nncalculating the value of a parseceditnnin the diagram above not to scale s represents the sun and e the earth at one point in its orbit thus the distance es is one astronomical unit au the angle sde is one arcsecond 1/3600 of a degree so by definition d is a point in space at a distance of one parsec from the sun through trigonometry the distance sd is calculated as follows:nnnnbecause the astronomical unit is defined to be 7011149597870700000149597870700 m the following can be calculated:nnna corollary states that a parsec is also the distance from which a disc one astronomical unit in diameter must be viewed for it to have an angular diameter of one arcsecond by placing the observer at d and a diameter of the disc on es.nmathematically to calculate distance given obtained angular measurements from instruments in arcseconds the formula would be:nnwhere is the measured angle in arcseconds distance is a constant 1 au or 1.581310 ly the calculated stellar distance will be in the same measurement unit as used in distance e.g if distance 1 au unit for distance is in astronomical units if distance 1.581310 ly unit for distance is in light years.nthe length of the parsec used in iau 2015 resolution b2 exactly 7005648000000000000648000 astronomical units corresponds exactly to that derived using the small-angle calculation this differs from the classic inverse-tangent definition by about 200 km i.e only after the 11th significant figure as the astronomical unit was defined by the iau 2012 as an exact si length in metres so now the parsec corresponds to an exact si length in metres to the nearest meter the small-angle parsec corresponds to 30,856,775,814,913,673 m.nnusage and measurementeditnthe parallax method is the fundamental calibration step for distance determination in astrophysics however the accuracy of ground-based telescope measurements of parallax angle is limited to about 0.01 arcseconds and thus to stars no more than 100 pc distant this is because the earths atmosphere limits the sharpness of a stars image space-based telescopes are not limited by this effect and can accurately measure distances to objects beyond the limit of ground-based observations between 1989 and 1993 the hipparcos satellite launched by the european space agency esa measured parallaxes for about 7005100000000000000100000 stars with an astrometric precision of about 0.97 milliarcseconds and obtained accurate measurements for stellar distances of stars up to 1000 pc away.nesas gaia satellite which launched on 19 december 2013 is intended to measure one billion stellar distances to within 20 microarcseconds producing errors of 10 in measurements as far as the galactic centre about 8000 pc away in the constellation of sagittarius.nndistances in parsecseditndistances less than a parseceditndistances expressed in fractions of a parsec usually involve objects within a single star system so for example:nnn the jet erupting from the active galactic nucleus of m87 is thought to be 70001500000000000001.5 kiloparsecs 70194626297201092014890 ly long image from hubble space telescopenparsecs and kiloparsecseditndistances expressed in parsecs pc include distances between nearby stars such as those in the same spiral arm or globular cluster a distance of 1000 parsecs 3262 light-years is commonly denoted by the kiloparsec kpc astronomers typically use kiloparsecs to express distances between parts of a galaxy or within groups of galaxies so for example:nnnmegaparsecs and gigaparsecseditna distance of one million parsecs is commonly denoted by the megaparsec mpc astronomers typically express the distances between neighbouring galaxies and galaxy clusters in megaparsecs.ngalactic distances are sometimes given in units of mpc/h as in 50/h mpc also written 50 mpc h h is a parameter in the range 0.5 h 0.75 reflecting the uncertainty in the value of the hubble constant h for the rate of expansion of the universe h h/100 km/s/mpc the hubble constant becomes relevant when converting an observed redshift z into a distance d using the formula d c/h z.none gigaparsec gpc is one billion parsecs one of the largest units of length commonly used one gigaparsec is about 3.26 billion light-years or roughly 1/14 of the distance to the horizon of the observable universe dictated by the cosmic background radiation astronomers typically use gigaparsecs to express the sizes of large-scale structures such as the size of and distance to the cfa2 great wall the distances between galaxy clusters and the distance to quasars.nfor example:nnnvolume unitseditnto determine the number of stars in the milky way volumes in cubic kiloparsecs kpc are selected in various directions all the stars in these volumes are counted and the total number of stars statistically determined the number of globular clusters dust clouds and interstellar gas is determined in a similar fashion to determine the number of galaxies in superclusters volumes in cubic megaparsecs mpc are selected all the galaxies in these volumes are classified and tallied the total number of galaxies can then be determined statistically the huge botes void is measured in cubic megaparsecs.nin physical cosmology volumes of cubic gigaparsecs gpc are selected to determine the distribution of matter in the visible universe and to determine the number of galaxies and quasars the sun is the only star in its cubic parsec pc but in globular clusters the stellar density could be from 100 to 1000 per cubic parsec.nnin popular cultureeditnthe parsec features in han solos claim that he made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs in both a new hope and solo a star wars story many say that parsec was used incorrectly in a new hope as a measurement of time not distance the term is also occasionally used in star trek.nnsee alsoeditnnnoteseditnnnreferenceseditnnnexternal linkseditnnnnnn
