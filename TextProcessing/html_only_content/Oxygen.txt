oxygen wikipedia n n jump to navigationnjump to searchnthis article is about the chemical element and its most stable form o for other forms of this element see allotropes of oxygen for other uses see oxygen disambiguation and o2 disambiguation.nnnchemical element with atomic number 8noxygen is a chemical element with symbol o and atomic number 8 it is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table a highly reactive nonmetal and an oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as with other compounds by mass oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe after hydrogen and helium at standard temperature and pressure two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula o diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8 of the earths atmosphere as compounds including oxides the element makes up almost half of the earths crust.ndioxygen is used in cellular respiration and many major classes of organic molecules in living organisms contain oxygen such as proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates and fats as do the major constituent inorganic compounds of animal shells teeth and bone most of the mass of living organisms is oxygen as a component of water the major constituent of lifeforms oxygen is continuously replenished in earths atmosphere by photosynthesis which uses the energy of sunlight to produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide oxygen is too chemically reactive to remain a free element in air without being continuously replenished by the photosynthetic action of living organisms another form allotrope of oxygen ozone o strongly absorbs ultraviolet uvb radiation and the high-altitude ozone layer helps protect the biosphere from ultraviolet radiation however ozone present at the surface is a byproduct of smog and thus a pollutant.noxygen was isolated by michael sendivogius before 1604 but it is commonly believed that the element was discovered independently by carl wilhelm scheele in uppsala in 1773 or earlier and joseph priestley in wiltshire in 1774 priority is often given for priestley because his work was published first priestley however called oxygen dephlogisticated air and did not recognize it as a chemical element the name oxygen was coined in 1777 by antoine lavoisier who first recognized oxygen as a chemical element and correctly characterized the role it plays in combustion.ncommon uses of oxygen include production of steel plastics and textiles brazing welding and cutting of steels and other metals rocket propellant oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft submarines spaceflight and diving.nncontentsnnnhistorynearly experimentsnone of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century bce greek writer on mechanics philo of byzantium in his work pneumatica philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessels neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass many centuries later leonardo da vinci built on philos work by observing that a portion of air is consumed during combustion and respiration.nin the late 17th century robert boyle proved that air is necessary for combustion english chemist john mayow 16411679 refined this work by showing that fire requires only a part of air that he called spiritus nitroaereus in one experiment he found that placing either a mouse or a lit candle in a closed container over water caused the water to rise and replace one-fourteenth of the airs volume before extinguishing the subjects from this he surmised that nitroaereus is consumed in both respiration and combustion.nmayow observed that antimony increased in weight when heated and inferred that the nitroaereus must have combined with it he also thought that the lungs separate nitroaereus from air and pass it into the blood and that animal heat and muscle movement result from the reaction of nitroaereus with certain substances in the body accounts of these and other experiments and ideas were published in 1668 in his work tractatus duo in the tract de respiratione".nnphlogiston theorynmain article phlogiston theorynrobert hooke ole borch mikhail lomonosov and pierre bayen all produced oxygen in experiments in the 17th and the 18th century but none of them recognized it as a chemical element this may have been in part due to the prevalence of the philosophy of combustion and corrosion called the phlogiston theory which was then the favored explanation of those processes.nestablished in 1667 by the german alchemist j j becher and modified by the chemist georg ernst stahl by 1731 phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made of two parts one part called phlogiston was given off when the substance containing it was burned while the dephlogisticated part was thought to be its true form or calx.nhighly combustible materials that leave little residue such as wood or coal were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston non-combustible substances that corrode such as iron contained very little air did not play a role in phlogiston theory nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea instead it was based on observations of what happens when something burns that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.nndiscoveryn joseph priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.npolish alchemist philosopher and physician michael sendivogius in his work de lapide philosophorum tractatus duodecim e naturae fonte et manuali experientia depromti 1604 described a substance contained in air referring to it as cibus vitae food of life and this substance is identical with oxygen sendivogius during his experiments performed between 1598 and 1604 properly recognized that the substance is equivalent to the gaseous byproduct released by the thermal decomposition of potassium nitrate in bugajs view the isolation of oxygen and the proper association of the substance to that part of air which is required for life lends sufficient weight to the discovery of oxygen by sendivogius this discovery of sendivogius was however frequently denied by the generations of scientists and chemists which succeeded him.nit is also commonly claimed that oxygen was first discovered by swedish pharmacist carl wilhelm scheele he had produced oxygen gas by heating mercuric oxide and various nitrates in 17712 scheele called the gas fire air because it was then the only known agent to support combustion he wrote an account of this discovery in a manuscript titled treatise on air and fire which he sent to his publisher in 1775 that document was published in 1777.nin the meantime on august 1 1774 an experiment conducted by the british clergyman joseph priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide hgo contained in a glass tube which liberated a gas he named dephlogisticated air he noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it after breathing the gas himself priestley wrote the feeling of it to my lungs was not sensibly different from that of common air but i fancied that my breast felt peculiarly light and easy for some time afterwards priestley published his findings in 1775 in a paper titled an account of further discoveries in air which was included in the second volume of his book titled experiments and observations on different kinds of air because he published his findings first priestley is usually given priority in the discovery.nthe french chemist antoine laurent lavoisier later claimed to have discovered the new substance independently priestley visited lavoisier in october 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas scheele also dispatched a letter to lavoisier on september 30 1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance but lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it a copy of the letter was found in scheeles belongings after his death.nnnlavoisiers contributionnlavoisier conducted the first adequate quantitative experiments on oxidation and gave the first correct explanation of how combustion works he used these and similar experiments all started in 1774 to discredit the phlogiston theory and to prove that the substance discovered by priestley and scheele was a chemical element.nn antoine lavoisier discredited the phlogiston theory.nin one experiment lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container he noted that air rushed in when he opened the container which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed he also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in this and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book sur la combustion en gnral which was published in 1777 in that work he proved that air is a mixture of two gases vital air which is essential to combustion and respiration and azote gk lifeless which did not support either azote later became nitrogen in english although it has kept the earlier name in french and several other european languages.nlavoisier renamed vital air to oxygne in 1777 from the greek roots oxys acid literally sharp from the taste of acids and gens producer literally begetter because he mistakenly believed that oxygen was a constituent of all acids chemists such as sir humphry davy in 1812 eventually determined that lavoisier was wrong in this regard hydrogen forms the basis for acid chemistry but by then the name was too well established.noxygen entered the english language despite opposition by english scientists and the fact that the englishman priestley had first isolated the gas and written about it this is partly due to a poem praising the gas titled oxygen in the popular book the botanic garden 1791 by erasmus darwin grandfather of charles darwin.nnnlater historyn robert h goddard and a liquid oxygen-gasoline rocketnjohn daltons original atomic hypothesis presumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another for example dalton assumed that waters formula was ho leading to the conclusion that the atomic mass of oxygen was 8 times that of hydrogen instead of the modern value of about 16 in 1805 joseph louis gay-lussac and alexander von humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen and by 1811 amedeo avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of waters composition based on what is now called avogadros law and the diatomic elemental molecules in those gases.nby the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it using a cascade method swiss chemist and physicist raoul pierre pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it he sent a telegram on december 22 1877 to the french academy of sciences in paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen just two days later french physicist louis paul cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted oxygen was liquefied in a stable state for the first time on march 29 1883 by polish scientists from jagiellonian university zygmunt wrblewski and karol olszewski.nin 1891 scottish chemist james dewar was able to produce enough liquid oxygen for study the first commercially viable process for producing liquid oxygen was independently developed in 1895 by german engineer carl von linde and british engineer william hampson both men lowered the temperature of air until it liquefied and then distilled the component gases by boiling them off one at a time and capturing them separately later in 1901 oxyacetylene welding was demonstrated for the first time by burning a mixture of acetylene and compressed o this method of welding and cutting metal later became common.nin 1923 the american scientist robert h goddard became the first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56 m at 97 km/h on march 16 1926 in auburn massachusetts us.noxygen levels in the atmosphere are trending slightly downward globally possibly because of fossil-fuel burning.nncharacteristicsnproperties and molecular structuren orbital diagram after barrett 2002 showing the participating atomic orbitals from each oxygen atom the molecular orbitals that result from their overlap and the aufbau filling of the orbitals with the 12 electrons 6 from each o atom beginning from the lowest energy orbitals and resulting in covalent double bond character from filled orbitals and cancellation of the contributions of the pairs of and and and orbital pairs.nat standard temperature and pressure oxygen is a colorless odorless and tasteless gas with the molecular formula o referred to as dioxygen.nas dioxygen two oxygen atoms are chemically bound to each other the bond can be variously described based on level of theory but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms the filling of which results in a bond order of two more specifically the double bond is the result of sequential low-to-high energy or aufbau filling of orbitals and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons after sequential filling of the low and orbitals overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the o-o molecular axis and overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the o-o molecular axis and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest and orbitals.nthis combination of cancellations and and overlaps results in dioxygens double bond character and reactivity and a triplet electronic ground state an electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as is found in dioxygen orbitals see the filled orbitals in the diagram that are of equal energyi.e degenerateis a configuration termed a spin triplet state hence the ground state of the o molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen the highest energy partially filled orbitals are antibonding and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two because of its unpaired electrons triplet oxygen reacts only slowly with most organic molecules which have paired electron spins this prevents spontaneous combustion.nn liquid oxygen temporarily suspended in a magnet owing to its paramagnetismnin the triplet form o molecules are paramagnetic that is they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule and the negative exchange energy between neighboring o molecules liquid oxygen is so magnetic that in laboratory demonstrations a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet.nsinglet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular o in which all the electron spins are paired it is much more reactive with common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se in nature singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis using the energy of sunlight it is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms and possibly animals play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues.nnallotropesnmain article allotropes of oxygenn space-filling model representation of dioxygen o moleculenthe common allotrope of elemental oxygen on earth is called dioxygen o the major part of the earths atmospheric oxygen see occurrence o has a bond length of 121 pm and a bond energy of 498 kj/mol which is smaller than the energy of other double bonds or pairs of single bonds in the biosphere and responsible for the exothermic reaction of o with any organic molecule due to its energy content o is used by complex forms of life such as animals in cellular respiration other aspects of o are covered in the remainder of this article.ntrioxygen o is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when o combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of o by ultraviolet uv radiation since ozone absorbs strongly in the uv region of the spectrum the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet near the earths surface it is a pollutant formed as a by-product of automobile exhaust at low earth orbit altitudes sufficient atomic oxygen is present to cause corrosion of spacecraft.nthe metastable molecule tetraoxygen o was discovered in 2001 and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen it was proven in 2006 that this phase created by pressurizing o to 20 gpa is in fact a rhombohedral o cluster this cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either o or o and may therefore be used in rocket fuel a metallic phase was discovered in 1990 when solid oxygen is subjected to a pressure of above 96 gpa and it was shown in 1998 that at very low temperatures this phase becomes superconducting.nnphysical propertiesn oxygen discharge spectrum tubensee also liquid oxygen and solid oxygennoxygen dissolves more readily in water than nitrogen and in freshwater more readily than seawater water in equilibrium with air contains approximately 1 molecule of dissolved o for every 2 molecules of n 1:2 compared with an atmospheric ratio of approximately 1:4 the solubility of oxygen in water is temperature-dependent and about twice as much 14.6 mgl dissolves at 0 c than at 20 c 7.6 mgl at 25 c and 1 standard atmosphere 101.3 kpa of air freshwater contains about 6.04 milliliters ml of oxygen per liter and seawater contains about 4.95 ml per liter at 5 c the solubility increases to 9.0 ml 50 more than at 25 c per liter for water and 7.2 ml 45 more per liter for sea water.nnnoxygen condenses at 90.20 k 182.95 c 297.31 f and freezes at 54.36 k 218.79 c 361.82 f both liquid and solid o are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red in contrast with the blue color of the sky which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light high-purity liquid o is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air liquid oxygen may also be condensed from air using liquid nitrogen as a coolant.noxygen is a highly reactive substance and must be segregated from combustible materials.nthe spectroscopy of molecular oxygen is associated with the atmospheric processes of aurora and airglow the absorption in the herzberg continuum and schumannrunge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen that is important in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere excited state singlet molecular oxygen is responsible for red chemiluminescence in solution.nnisotopes and stellar originnmain article isotopes of oxygenn late in a massive stars life o concentrates in the o-shell o in the h-shell and o in the he-shell.nnaturally occurring oxygen is composed of three stable isotopes o o and o with o being the most abundant 99.762 natural abundance.nmost o is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in massive stars but some is made in the neon burning process o is primarily made by the burning of hydrogen into helium during the cno cycle making it a common isotope in the hydrogen burning zones of stars most o is produced when n made abundant from cno burning captures a he nucleus making o common in the helium-rich zones of evolved massive stars.nfourteen radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable are o with a half-life of 122.24 seconds and o with a half-life of 70.606 seconds all of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 27 s and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than 83 milliseconds the most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than o is decay to yield nitrogen and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than o is beta decay to yield fluorine.nnoccurrencensee also silicate minerals category:oxide minerals stellar population cosmochemistry and astrochemistrynnoxygen is the most abundant chemical element by mass in the earths biosphere air sea and land oxygen is the third most abundant chemical element in the universe after hydrogen and helium about 0.9 of the suns mass is oxygen oxygen constitutes 49.2 of the earths crust by mass as part of oxide compounds such as silicon dioxide and is the most abundant element by mass in the earths crust it is also the major component of the worlds oceans 88.8 by mass oxygen gas is the second most common component of the earths atmosphere taking up 20.8 of its volume and 23.1 of its mass some 10 tonnes earth is unusual among the planets of the solar system in having such a high concentration of oxygen gas in its atmosphere mars with 0.1 o by volume and venus have much less the o surrounding those planets is produced solely by the action of ultraviolet radiation on oxygen-containing molecules such as carbon dioxide.nthe unusually high concentration of oxygen gas on earth is the result of the oxygen cycle this biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on earth the atmosphere the biosphere and the lithosphere the main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis which is responsible for modern earths atmosphere photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere while respiration decay and combustion remove it from the atmosphere in the present equilibrium production and consumption occur at the same rate.nn cold water holds more dissolved o.nfree oxygen also occurs in solution in the worlds water bodies the increased solubility of o at lower temperatures see physical properties has important implications for ocean life as polar oceans support a much higher density of life due to their higher oxygen content water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce the o content in eutrophic water bodies scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the waters biochemical oxygen demand or the amount of o needed to restore it to a normal concentration.nnanalysisn 500 million years of climate change vs onpaleoclimatologists measure the ratio of oxygen-18 and oxygen-16 in the shells and skeletons of marine organisms to determine the climate millions of years ago see oxygen isotope ratio cycle seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope oxygen-16 evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12 heavier oxygen-18 and this disparity increases at lower temperatures during periods of lower global temperatures snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen-16 and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen-18 marine organisms then incorporate more oxygen-18 into their skeletons and shells than they would in a warmer climate paleoclimatologists also directly measure this ratio in the water molecules of ice core samples as old as hundreds of thousands of years.nplanetary geologists have measured the relative quantities of oxygen isotopes in samples from the earth the moon mars and meteorites but were long unable to obtain reference values for the isotope ratios in the sun believed to be the same as those of the primordial solar nebula analysis of a silicon wafer exposed to the solar wind in space and returned by the crashed genesis spacecraft has shown that the sun has a higher proportion of oxygen-16 than does the earth the measurement implies that an unknown process depleted oxygen-16 from the suns disk of protoplanetary material prior to the coalescence of dust grains that formed the earth.noxygen presents two spectrophotometric absorption bands peaking at the wavelengths 687 and 760 nm some remote sensing scientists have proposed using the measurement of the radiance coming from vegetation canopies in those bands to characterize plant health status from a satellite platform this approach exploits the fact that in those bands it is possible to discriminate the vegetations reflectance from its fluorescence which is much weaker the measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale.nnnbiological role of onmain article dioxygen in biological reactionsnphotosynthesis and respirationn photosynthesis splits water to liberate o and fixes co into sugar in what is called a calvin cycle.nin nature free oxygen is produced by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis according to some estimates green algae and cyanobacteria in marine environments provide about 70 of the free oxygen produced on earth and the rest is produced by terrestrial plants other estimates of the oceanic contribution to atmospheric oxygen are higher while some estimates are lower suggesting oceans produce 45 of earths atmospheric oxygen each year.na simplified overall formula for photosynthesis is:nnnor simplynnnphotolytic oxygen evolution occurs in the thylakoid membranes of photosynthetic organisms and requires the energy of four photons many steps are involved but the result is the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane which is used to synthesize adenosine triphosphate atp via photophosphorylation the o remaining after production of the water molecule is released into the atmosphere.noxygen is used in mitochondria to generate atp during oxidative phosphorylation the reaction for aerobic respiration is essentially the reverse of photosynthesis and is simplified as:nnnin vertebrates o diffuses through membranes in the lungs and into red blood cells hemoglobin binds o changing color from bluish red to bright red co is released from another part of hemoglobin through the bohr effect other animals use hemocyanin molluscs and some arthropods or hemerythrin spiders and lobsters a liter of blood can dissolve 200 cm of o.nuntil the discovery of anaerobic metazoa oxygen was thought to be a requirement for all complex life.nreactive oxygen species such as superoxide ion o and hydrogen peroxide ho are reactive by-products of oxygen use in organisms parts of the immune system of higher organisms create peroxide superoxide and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes reactive oxygen species also play an important role in the hypersensitive response of plants against pathogen attack oxygen is damaging to obligately anaerobic organisms which were the dominant form of early life on earth until o began to accumulate in the atmosphere about 2.5 billion years ago during the great oxygenation event about a billion years after the first appearance of these organisms.nan adult human at rest inhales 1.8 to 2.4 grams of oxygen per minute this amounts to more than 6 billion tonnes of oxygen inhaled by humanity per year.nnliving organismsnnnnthe free oxygen partial pressure in the body of a living vertebrate organism

photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved probably about 3.5 billion years ago free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic eon between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago for the first billion years any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations when such oxygen sinks became saturated free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 32.7 billion years ago reaching 10 of its present level around 1.7 billion years ago.nthe presence of large amounts of dissolved and free oxygen in the oceans and atmosphere may have driven most of the extant anaerobic organisms to extinction during the great oxygenation event oxygen catastrophe about 2.4 billion years ago cellular respiration using o enables aerobic organisms to produce much more atp than anaerobic organisms cellular respiration of o occurs in all eukaryotes including all complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals.nsince the beginning of the cambrian period 540 million years ago atmospheric o levels have fluctuated between 15 and 30 by volume towards the end of the carboniferous period about 300 million years ago atmospheric o levels reached a maximum of 35 by volume which may have contributed to the large size of insects and amphibians at this time.nvariations in atmospheric oxygen concentration have shaped past climates when oxygen declined atmospheric density dropped which in turn increased surface evaporation causing precipitation increases and warmer temperatures.nat the current rate of

separation oxygen evolution and fractional distillationnone hundred million tonnes of o are extracted from air for industrial uses annually by two primary methods the most common method is fractional distillation of liquefied air with n distilling as a vapor while o is left as a liquid.nthe other primary method of producing o is passing a stream of clean dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 to 93 o simultaneously nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it in the reverse direction of flow after a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline this is known as pressure swing adsorption oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies see also the related vacuum swing adsorption.noxygen gas can also be produced through electrolysis of water into molecular oxygen and hydrogen dc electricity must be used if ac is used the gases in each limb consist of hydrogen and oxygen in the explosive ratio 2:1 a similar method is the electrocatalytic o evolution from oxides and oxoacids chemical catalysts can be used as well such as in chemical oxygen generators or oxygen candles that are used as part of the life-support equipment on submarines and are still part of standard equipment on commercial airliners in case of depressurization emergencies another air separation method is forcing air to dissolve through ceramic membranes based on zirconium dioxide by either high pressure or an electric current to produce nearly pure o gas.nnstoragen oxygen and mapp gas compressed gas cylinders with regulatorsnoxygen storage methods include high pressure oxygen tanks cryogenics and chemical compounds for reasons of economy oxygen is often transported in bulk as a liquid in specially insulated tankers since one liter of liquefied oxygen is equivalent to 840 liters of gaseous oxygen at atmospheric pressure and 20 c 68 f such tankers are used to refill bulk liquid oxygen storage containers which stand outside hospitals and other institutions that need large volumes of pure oxygen gas liquid oxygen is passed through heat exchangers which convert the cryogenic liquid into gas before it enters the building oxygen is also stored and shipped in smaller cylinders containing the compressed gas

pneumonia some heart disorders congestive heart failure some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure and any disease that impairs the bodys ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen.ntreatments are flexible enough to be used in hospitals the patients home or increasingly by portable devices oxygen tents were once commonly used in oxygen supplementation but have since been

the medical staff carbon monoxide poisoning gas gangrene and decompression sickness the bends are sometimes addressed with this therapy increased o concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive resulting in bubbles of inert gas mostly nitrogen and helium forming in the blood increasing the pressure of o as soon as possible helps to redissolve the bubbles back into the blood so that these excess gasses can be exhaled naturally through the lungs.nnormobaric oxygen administration at the highest available concentration is frequently used as first aid for any diving injury that may involve inert gas bubble formation in the tissues there is epidemiological support for its use from a statistical study of cases recorded in a long term database.nnnlife support and recreational usen low pressure pure o is used in space suits.nan application of o as a low-pressure breathing gas is in modern space suits which surround their occupants body with the breathing gas these devices use nearly pure oxygen at about one-third normal pressure resulting in a normal blood partial pressure of o this trade-off of higher oxygen concentration for lower pressure is needed to maintain suit flexibility.nscuba and surface-supplied underwater divers and submariners also rely on artificially delivered o submarines submersibles and atmospheric diving suits usually operate at normal atmospheric pressure breathing air is scrubbed of carbon dioxide by chemical extraction and oxygen is replaced to maintain a constant partial pressure ambient pressure divers breathe air or gas mixtures with an oxygen fraction suited to the operating depth pure or nearly pure o use in diving at pressures higher than atmospheric is usually limited to rebreathers or decompression at relatively shallow depths 6 meters depth or less or medical treatment in recompression chambers at pressures up to 2.8 bar where acute oxygen toxicity can be managed without the risk of drowning deeper diving requires significant dilution of o with other gases such as nitrogen or helium to prevent oxygen toxicity.npeople who climb mountains or fly in non-pressurized fixed-wing aircraft sometimes have supplemental o supplies pressurized commercial airplanes have an emergency supply of o automatically supplied to the passengers in case of cabin depressurization sudden cabin pressure loss activates chemical oxygen generators above each seat causing oxygen masks to drop pulling on the masks to start the flow of oxygen as cabin safety instructions dictate forces iron filings into the sodium chlorate inside the canister a steady stream of oxygen gas is then produced by the exothermic reaction.noxygen as a mild euphoric has a history of recreational use in oxygen bars and in sports oxygen bars are establishments found in the united states since the late 1990s that offer higher than normal o exposure for a minimal fee professional athletes especially in american football sometimes go off-field between plays to don oxygen masks to boost performance the pharmacological effect is doubted a placebo effect is a more likely explanation available studies support a performance boost from oxygen enriched mixtures only if it is breathed during aerobic exercise.nother recreational uses that do not involve breathing include pyrotechnic applications such as george gobles five-second ignition of barbecue grills.nnindustrialn most commercially produced o is used to smelt and/or decarburize iron.nsmelting of iron ore into steel consumes 55 of commercially produced oxygen in this process o is injected through a high-pressure lance into molten iron which removes sulfur impurities and excess carbon as the respective oxides so and co the reactions are

water molecule but also have an additional attraction about 23.3 kj/mol per hydrogen atom to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule these hydrogen bonds between water molecules hold them approximately 15 closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just van der waals forces.nn oxides such as iron oxide or rust form when oxygen combines with other elements.ndue to its electronegativity oxygen forms chemical bonds with almost all other elements to give corresponding oxides the surface of most metals such as aluminium and titanium are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that passivates the metal and slows further corrosion many oxides of the transition metals are non-stoichiometric compounds with slightly less metal than the chemical formula would show for example the mineral feo wstite is written as feo where x is usually around 0.05.noxygen is present in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of carbon dioxide co the earths crustal rock is composed in large part of oxides of silicon silica sio as found in granite and quartz aluminium aluminium oxide alo in bauxite and corundum iron ironiii oxide feo in hematite and rust and calcium carbonate in limestone the rest of the earths crust is also made of oxygen compounds in particular various complex silicates in silicate minerals the earths mantle of much larger mass than the crust is largely composed of silicates of magnesium and iron.nwater-soluble silicates in the form of nasio nasio and nasio are used as detergents and adhesives.noxygen also acts as a ligand for transition metals forming transition metal dioxygen complexes which feature metalo this class of compounds includes the heme proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin an exotic and unusual reaction occurs with ptf which oxidizes oxygen to give optf dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate.nnorganic compoundsn acetone is an important feeder material in the chemical industry oxygen carbon hydrogennamong the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are where r is an organic group alcohols r-oh ethers r-o-r ketones r-co-r aldehydes r-co-h carboxylic acids r-cooh esters r-coo-r acid anhydrides r-co-o-co-r and amides r-co-nr there are many important organic solvents that contain oxygen including acetone methanol ethanol isopropanol furan thf diethyl ether dioxane ethyl acetate dmf dmso acetic acid and formic acid acetone chco and phenol choh are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are glycerol formaldehyde glutaraldehyde citric acid acetic anhydride and acetamide epoxides are ethers in which the oxygen atom is part of a ring of three atoms the element is similarly found in almost all biomolecules that are important to or generated by life.noxygen reacts spontaneously with many organic compounds at or below room temperature in a process called autoxidation most of the organic compounds that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of o organic compounds important in industry and commerce that are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include ethylene oxide and peracetic acid.nnsafety and precautionsnthe nfpa 704 standard rates compressed oxygen gas as nonhazardous to health nonflammable and nonreactive but an oxidizer refrigerated liquid oxygen lox is given a health hazard rating of 3 for increased risk of hyperoxia from condensed vapors and for hazards common to cryogenic liquids such as frostbite and all other ratings are the same as the compressed gas form.nntoxicitynmain article oxygen toxicityn main symptoms of oxygen toxicitynoxygen gas o can be toxic at elevated partial pressures leading to convulsions and other health problems oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals kpa equal to about 50 oxygen composition at standard pressure or 2.5 times the normal sea-level o partial pressure of about 21 kpa this is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30%50 o by volume about 30 kpa at standard pressure.nat one time premature babies were placed in incubators containing o-rich air but this practice was discontinued after some babies were blinded by the oxygen content being too high.nbreathing pure o in space applications such as in some modern space suits or in early spacecraft such as apollo causes no damage due to the low total pressures used in the case of spacesuits the o partial pressure in the breathing gas is in general about 30 kpa 1.4 times normal and the resulting o partial pressure in the astronauts arterial blood is only marginally more than normal sea-level o partial pressure.noxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o partial pressure more than 60 kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis exposure to a o partial pressures greater than 160 kpa about 1.6 atm may lead to convulsions normally fatal for divers acute oxygen toxicity causing seizures its most feared effect for divers can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 o at 66 m 217 ft or more of depth the same thing can occur by breathing 100 o at only 6 m 20 ft.nncombustion and other hazardsn the interior of the apollo 1 command module pure o at higher than normal pressure and a spark led to a fire and the loss of the apollo 1 crew.nhighly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity an ignition event such as heat or a spark is needed to trigger combustion oxygen is the oxidant not the fuel but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion.nconcentrated o will allow combustion to proceed rapidly and energetically steel pipes and storage vessels used to store and transmit both gaseous and liquid oxygen will act as a fuel and therefore the design and manufacture of o systems requires special training to ensure that ignition sources are minimized the fire that killed the apollo 1 crew in a launch pad test spread so rapidly because the capsule was pressurized with pure o but at slightly more than atmospheric pressure instead of the normal pressure that would be used in a mission.nliquid oxygen spills if allowed to soak into organic matter such as wood petrochemicals and asphalt can cause these materials to detonate unpredictably on subsequent mechanical impact.nnnsee alsonnnnnnotesnnnreferencesnnngeneral referencesnnexternal linksnlisten to
