the north pacific ocean extending some 1,500 miles 2,400 kilometers from the island of hawaii in the south to northernmost kure atoll formerly the group was known to europeans and americans as the sandwich islands a name chosen by james cook in honor of the then first lord of the admiralty john montagu 4th earl of sandwich the contemporary name is derived from the name of the largest island hawaii island.nthe u.s state of hawaii now occupies the archipelago almost in its entirety including the uninhabited northwestern hawaiian islands with the sole exception of midway island which instead separately belongs to the united states as one of its unincorporated territories within the united states minor outlying islands.nthe hawaiian islands are the exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the hawaiianemperor seamount chain formed by volcanic activity over a hotspot in the earths mantle the islands are about 1,860 miles 3,000 km from the nearest continent.nncontentsnnnislands and reefseditnmain article history of hawaiincaptain james cook visited the islands on january 18 1778 and named them the sandwich islands in honor of john montagu 4th earl of sandwich who was one of his sponsors as the first lord of the admiralty this name was in use until the 1840s when the local name hawaii gradually began to take precedence.nthe hawaiian islands

riversnthis chain of islands or archipelago developed as the pacific plate moved slowly northwestward over a hotspot in the earths mantle at a rate of approximately 32 miles 51 km per million years thus the southeast island is volcanically active whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller due to longer exposure to erosion the age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods from this study and others it is estimated that the northwesternmost island kure atoll is the oldest at approximately 28 million years ma while the southeasternmost island hawaii is approximately 0.4 ma 400,000 years the only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on the southeastern island hawaii and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast loihi the hawaiian volcano observatory of the usgs documents recent volcanic activity and provides images and interpretations of the volcanism klauea has been erupting nearly continuously since 1983.nalmost all of the magma of the hotspot has the composition of basalt and so the hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock there is very little coarser-grained gabbro and diabase nephelinite is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare the majority of eruptions in hawaii are hawaiian-type eruptions because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the pacific basin.nn eruptions from the hawaii hotspot left a trail of underwater mountains across the pacific over millions of years called the emperor seamountsnhawaii island the big island is the biggest and youngest island in the chain built from five volcanoes mauna loa taking up over half of the big island is the largest shield volcano on the earth the measurement from sea level to summit is more than 2.5 miles 4 km from sea level to sea floor about 3.1 miles 5 km..nnearthquakeseditnmain article list of earthquakes in hawaiinthe hawaiian islands have many earthquakes generally caused by volcanic activity most of the early earthquake monitoring took place in hilo by missionaries titus coan sarah j lyman and her family from 1833 to 1896 approximately 4 or 5 earthquakes were reported per year.nhawaii accounted for 7.3 of the united states reported earthquakes with a magnitude 3.5 or greater from 1974 to 2003 with a total 1533 earthquakes hawaii ranked as the state with the third most earthquakes over this time period after alaska and california.non october 15 2006 there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 off the northwest coast of the island of hawaii near the kona area of the big island the initial earthquake was followed approximately five minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 aftershock minor-to-moderate damage was reported on most of the big island several major roadways became impassable from rock slides and effects were felt as far away as honolulu oahu nearly 150 miles 240 km from the epicenter power outages lasted for several hours to days several water mains ruptured no deaths or life-threatening injuries were reported.non may 4 2018 there was a 6.9 earthquake in the zone of volcanic activity from klauea.nearthquakes are monitored by the hawaiian volcano observatory run by the usgs.nntsunamiseditn aftermath of the 1960 chilean tsunami in hilo hawaii where the tsunami left 61 people dead and 282 seriously injured the waves reached 35 feet 11 m high.nthe hawaiian islands are subject to tsunamis great waves that strike the shore tsunamis are most often caused by earthquakes somewhere in the pacific the waves produced by the earthquakes travel at speeds of 400500 miles per hour 600800 km/h and can affect coastal regions thousands of miles kilometers away.ntsunamis may also originate from the hawaiian islands explosive volcanic activity can cause tsunamis the island of molokai had a catastrophic collapse or debris avalanche over a million years ago this underwater landslide likely caused tsunamis the hilina slump on the island of hawaii is another potential place for a large landslide and resulting tsunami.nthe city of hilo on the big island has been most affected by tsunamis where the in-rushing water is accentuated by the shape of hilo bay coastal cities have tsunami warning sirens.na tsunami resulting from an earthquake in chile hit the islands on february 27 2010 it was relatively minor but local emergency management officials utilized the latest technology and ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event the governor declared it a good drill for the next major event.na tsunami resulting from an earthquake in japan hit the islands on march 11 2011 it was relatively minor but local officials ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event the tsunami caused about 30.1 million in damages.nnecologyeditnsee also endemism in the hawaiian islands list of animal species introduced to the hawaiian islands and list of invasive plant species in hawaiinthe islands are home to many endemic species since human settlement first by polynesians non native trees plants and animals were introduced these included species such as rats and pigs that have preyed on native birds and invertebrates that initially evolved in the absence of such predators the growing population of humans has also led to deforestation forest degradation treeless grasslands and environmental degradation as a result many species which depended on forest habitats and food became extinct--with many current species facing extinction as humans cleared land for farming monocultural crop production replaced multi-species systems.nthe arrival of the europeans had a more significant impact with the promotion of large-scale single-species export agriculture and livestock grazing this led to increased clearing of forests and the development of towns adding many more species to the list of extinct animals of the hawaiian islands as of 2009 many of the remaining endemic species are considered endangered.nnnational monumenteditnnon june 15 2006 president george w bush issued a public proclamation creating papahnaumokukea marine national monument under the antiquities act of 1906

papahnaumokukea to its list of world heritage sites on august 26 2016 president barack obama greatly expanded papahnaumokukea quadrupling it from its original size.nnclimateeditnmain article climate of hawaiinthe climate of the hawaiian islands is tropical but it experiences many different climates depending on altitude and weather the islands receive most rainfall from the trade winds on their north and east flanks the windward side as a result of orographic precipitation coastal areas in general and especially the south and west flanks or leeward sides tend to be drier.nin general the lowlands of hawaiian islands receive most of their precipitation during the winter months october to april drier conditions generally prevail from may to september the tropical storms and occasional
