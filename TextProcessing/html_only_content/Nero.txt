consent of the praetorian guard neros mother agrippina the younger was likely implicated in claudius death and neros nomination as emperor she dominated neros early life and decisions until he cast her off five years into his reign he had her murdered.nduring the early years of his reign nero was content to be guided by his mother his tutor lucius annaeus seneca and his praetorian prefect sextus afranius burrus as time passed he started to play a more active and independent role in government and foreign policy during his reign the redoubtable general corbulo conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the parthian empire his general suetonius paulinus crushed a major revolt in britain led by the iceni queen boudica the bosporan kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire and the first jewishroman war began nero focused much of his attention on diplomacy trade and the cultural life of the empire ordering theatres built and promoting athletic games he made public appearances as an actor poet musician and charioteer in the eyes of traditionalists this undermined the dignity and authority of his person status and office his extravagant empire-wide program of public and private works was funded by a rise in taxes that was much resented by the middle and upper classes various plots against his life were revealed the ringleaders most of them neros own courtiers were executed.nin 68 ad vindex governor of the gaulish territory gallia lugdunensis rebelled he was supported by galba the governor of hispania tarraconensis vindexs revolt failed in its immediate aim but nero fled rome when romes discontented civil and military authorities chose galba as emperor he committed suicide on june 9 68 ad when he learned that he had been tried in absentia and condemned to death as a public enemy making him the first roman emperor to commit suicide his death ended the julio-claudian dynasty sparking a brief period of civil wars known as the year of the four emperors.nneros rule is usually associated with tyranny and extravagance most roman sources such as suetonius and cassius dio offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign tacitus claims that the roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt suetonius tells that many romans believed that the great fire of rome was instigated by nero to clear the way for his planned palatial complex the domus aurea according to tacitus he was said to have seized christians as scapegoats for the fire and burned them alive seemingly motivated not by public justice but by personal cruelty some modern historians question the reliability of the ancient sources on neros tyrannical acts a few sources paint nero in a more favorable light there is evidence of his popularity among the roman commoners especially in the eastern provinces of the empire where a popular legend arose that nero had not died and would return at least three leaders of short-lived failed rebellions presented themselves as nero reborn to enlist popular support.nncontentsnnnearly lifeeditnnero was born lucius domitius ahenobarbus on 15 december 37 ad in antium he was the only son of gnaeus domitius ahenobarbus and agrippina the younger his maternal grandparents were germanicus and agrippina the elder his mother caligulas sister he was augustus great-great grandson descended from the first emperors only daughter julia.nthe ancient biographer suetonius who was critical of neros ancestors wrote that augustus had reproached neros grandfather for his unseemly enjoyment of violent gladiator games according to jrgen malitz suetonius tells that neros father was known to be irascible and brutal and that both enjoyed chariot races and theater performances to a degree not befitting their position."nneros father domitius died in 40 a few years before his death domitius had been involved in a political scandal that according to malitz could have cost him his life if tiberius had not died in the year 37 in the previous year neros mother agrippina had been caught up in a scandal of her own caligulas beloved sister drusilla had recently died and caligula began to feel threatened by his brother-in-law marcus aemilius lepidus agrippina suspected of adultery with her brother-in-law was forced to carry the funerary urn after lepidus execution caligula then banished his two surviving sisters agrippina and julia livilla to a remote island in the mediterranean sea according to the oxford encyclopedia of ancient greece and rome agrippina was exiled for plotting to overthrow caligula neros inheritance was taken from him and he was sent to live with his paternal aunt domitia lepida the mother of claudius third wife valeria messalina.ncaligulas reign lasted from 37 until 41 he died from multiple stab wounds in january of 41 after being ambushed by his own praetorian guard on the palatine hill claudius succeeded caligula as emperor agrippina married claudius in 49 ad and became his fourth wife by february 49 she had persuaded claudius to adopt her son nero after neros adoption claudius became part of his name nero claudius caesar drusus germanicus claudius had gold coins issued to mark the adoption classics professor josiah osgood has written that the coins through their distribution and imagery alike showed that a new leader was in the making david shotter noted that despite events in rome neros step-brother britannicus was more prominent in provincial coinages during the early 50s.nnero officially formally entered public life as an adult in 51 adhe was around 14 years old when he turned 16 nero married claudius daughter his own step-sister claudia octavia between the years 51 ad and 53 ad he gave several speeches on behalf of various communities including the ilians the apameans requesting a five-year tax reprieve after an earthquake and the northern colony of bologna after their settlement suffered a devastating fire.nn an aureus of nero and his mother agrippina c 54n coin issued under claudius celebrating young nero as the future emperor c 50nclaudius died in 54 ad many ancient historians claim that he was poisoned by agrippina shotter has written that claudius death in 54 ad has usually been regarded as an event hastened by agrippina because of signs that claudius was showing a renewed affection for his natural son but he notes that among ancient sources josephus was uniquely reserved in describing the poisoning as a rumor contemporary sources differ in their accounts tacitus says that locusta prepared the poison which was served to the emperor by his food taster halotus tacitus also writes that agrippina arranged for claudius doctor xenophon to administer poison in the event that the emperor survived suetonius differs in some details but also implicates halotus and agrippina like tacitus cassius dio writes that the poison was prepared by locusta but in dios account it is administered by agrippina instead of halotus in apocolocyntosis seneca the younger does not mention mushrooms at all agrippinas involvement in claudius death is not accepted by all modern scholars.nbefore claudius death agrippina had maneuvered to remove britannicus tutors and replace them with tutors she had selected she was also able to convince claudius to replace with a single commander burrus two prefects of the praetorian guard who were suspected of supporting brittanicus since agrippina had replaced the guard officers with men loyal to her nero was able to assume power without incident.nnneros reign 54 ad68 adeditnmost of what we know about neros reign comes from three ancient writers tacitus suetonius and greek historian cassius dio.naccording to ancient historians neros construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of expenditures under nero left italy thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money with the provinces ruined modern historians though note that the period was riddled with deflation and that it is likely that neros spending came in the form of public-works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles.nnearly reigneditn statue of nero as a boynnero became emperor in 54 ad aged sixteen years this made him the youngest sole emperor until elagabalus who became emperor aged 14 in 218 the first five years of neros reign were described as quinquennium neronis by trajan the

the augustan model in his principate to end all secret trials intra cubiculum to have done with the corruption of court favorites and freedmen and above all to respect the privileges of the senate and individual senators his respect of the senatorial autonomy which distinguished him from caligula and claudius was generally well received by the roman senate.nscullard writes that neros mother agrippina meant to rule through her son agrippina murdered her political rivals domitia lepida the aunt that nero had lived with during agrippinas exile marcus junius silanus a great grandson of augustus and narcissus one of the earliest coins that nero issues during his reign shows agrippina on the coins obverse side usually this would be reserved for a portrait of the emperor the senate also allowed agrippina two lictors during public appearances an honor that was customarily bestowed upon only magistrates and the vestalis maxima in ad 55 nero removed agrippinas ally marcus antonius pallas from his position in the treasury shotter writes the following about agrippinas deteriorating relationship with nero what seneca and burrus probably saw as relatively harmless in nerohis cultural pursuits and his affair with the slave girl claudia actewere to her signs of her sons dangerous emancipation of himself from her influence britannicus was poisoned after agrippina threatened to side with him nero who was having an affair with acte exiled agrippina from the palace when she began to cultivate a relationship with his wife octavia.njrgen malitz writes that ancient sources do not provide any clear evidence to evaluate the extent of neros personal involvement in politics during the first years of his reign he describes the policies that are explicitly attributed to nero as well-meant but incompetent notions like neros failed initiative to abolish taxes in 58 ad scholars generally credit neros advisors burrus and seneca with the administrative successes of these years malitz writes that in later years nero panicked when he had to make decisions on his own during times of crisis.nnmatricideeditn coin of nero and poppaea sabinanthe oxford encyclopedia of ancient greece and rome cautiously notes that neros reasons for killing his mother in 59 ad are not fully understood according to tacitus the source of conflict between nero and his mother was neros affair with poppaea sabina in histories tacitus writes that the affair began while poppaea was still married to rufrius crispinus but in his later work annals tacitus says poppaea was married to otho when the affair began in annals tacitus writes that agrippina opposed neros affair with poppaea because of her affection for his wife octavia anthony barrett writes that tacitus account in annals suggests that poppaeas challenge drove nero over the brink a number of modern historians have noted that agrippinas death would not have offered much advantage for poppaea as nero did not marry poppaea until 62 ad barrett writes that poppaea seems to serve as a literary device utilized by tacitus because he could see no plausible explanation for neros conduct and also incidentally served to show that nero like claudius had fallen under the malign influence of a woman according to suetonius nero had his former freedman anicetus arrange a shipwreck agrippina survived the wreck swam ashore and was executed by anicetus who reported her death as a suicide.nndeclineeditnmodern scholars believe that neros reign had been going well in the years before agrippinas death for example nero promoted the exploration of the nile river sources with a successful expedition after agrippinas exile burrus and seneca were responsible for the administration of the empire however neros conduct became far more egregious after his mothers death miriam t griffins suggests that neros decline began as early as 55 ad with the murder of his stepbrother britannicus but also notes that nero lost all sense of right and wrong and listened to flattery with total credulity after agrippinas death griffin points out that tacitus makes explicit the significance of agrippinas removal for neros conduct".nin 62 ad neros adviser burrus died that same year nero called for the first treason trial of his reign maiestas trial against antistius sosianus he also executed his rivals cornelius sulla and rubellius plautus jrgen malitz considers this to be a turning point in neros relationship with the roman senate malitz writes that nero abandoned the restraint he had previously shown because he believed a course supporting the senate promised to be less and less profitable."nafter burrus death nero appointed two new praetorian prefects faenius rufus and ofonius tigellinus politically isolated seneca was forced to retire according to tacitus nero divorced octavia on grounds of infertility and banished her after public protests over octavias exile nero accused her of adultery with anicetus and she was executed.nin 64 ad nero married pythagoras a freedman.nngreat fire of romeeditnmain article great fire of romenthe great fire of rome erupted on the night of 18 july to 19 july ad 64 the fire started on the slope of the aventine overlooking the circus maximus.nn the fire of rome by hubert robert 1785 tacitus the main ancient source for information about the fire wrote that countless mansions residences and temples were destroyed tacitus and cassius dio have both written of extensive damage to the palatine which has been supported by subsequent archaeological excavations the fire is

some ancient accounts described the fire as an accident while others had claimed that it was a plot of neros tacitus is the only surviving source which does not blame nero for starting the fire he says he is unsure pliny the elder suetonius and cassius dio all wrote that nero was responsible for the fire these accounts give several reasons for neros alleged arson like neros envy of king priam and a dislike for the citys ancient construction suetonius wrote that nero started the fire because he wanted the space to build his golden house this golden house or domus aurea included lush artificial landscapes and a 30-meter-tall statue of himself the colossus of nero the size of this complex is debated from 100 to 300 acres.ntacitus wrote that nero accused christians of starting the fire to remove suspicion from himself according to this account many christians were arrested and brutally executed by being thrown to the beasts crucified and being burned alive".nsuetonius and cassius dio alleged that nero sang the sack of ilium in stage costume while the city burned the popular legend that nero played the fiddle while rome burned is at least partly a literary construct of flavian propaganda which looked askance on the abortive neronian attempt to rewrite augustan models of rule."naccording to tacitus nero was in antium during the fire upon hearing news of the fire nero returned to rome to organize a relief effort which he paid for from his own funds neros contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the blaze spending days searching the debris without even his bodyguards after the fire nero opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors.nin the wake of the fire he made a new urban development plan houses built after the fire were spaced out built in brick and faced by porticos on wide roads nero also built a new palace complex known as the domus aurea in an area cleared by the fire to find the necessary funds for the reconstruction tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire the cost to rebuild rome was immense requiring funds the state treasury did not have nero devalued the roman currency for the first time in the empires history he reduced the weight of the denarius from 84 per roman pound to 96 3.80 grams to 3.30 grams he also reduced the silver purity from 99.5 to 93.5%the silver weight dropping from 3.80 grams to 2.97 grams furthermore nero reduced the weight of

conspirators wished to rescue the state from the emperor and restore the republic the freedman milichus discovered the conspiracy and reported it to neros secretary epaphroditos as a result the conspiracy failed and its members were executed including lucan the poet neros previous advisor seneca was accused by natalis he denied the charges but was still ordered to commit suicide as by this point he had fallen out of favor with nero.nnero was said to have kicked poppaea to death in 65 ad before she could have his second child modern historians noting the probable biases of suetonius tacitus and cassius dio and the likely absence of eyewitnesses to such an event propose that poppaea may have died after miscarriage or in childbirth nero went into deep mourning poppaea was given a sumptuous state funeral divine honors and was promised a temple for her cult a years importation of incense was burned at the funeral her body was not cremated as would have been strictly customary but embalmed after the egyptian manner and entombed it is not known where.nnthe revolt of vindex and galba and the death of neroeditn a marble bust of nero antiquarium of the palatine.nin march 68 gaius julius vindex the governor of gallia lugdunensis rebelled against neros tax policies lucius verginius rufus the governor of germania superior was ordered to put down vindexs rebellion in an attempt to gain support from outside his own province vindex called upon servius sulpicius galba the governor of hispania tarraconensis to join the rebellion and further to declare himself emperor in opposition to nero.nat the battle of vesontio in may 68 verginius forces easily defeated those of vindex and the latter committed suicide however after putting down this one rebel verginius legions attempted to proclaim their own commander as emperor verginius refused to act against nero but the discontent of the legions of germany and the continued opposition of galba in spain did not bode well for him.nwhile nero had retained some control of the situation support for galba increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy hostis publicus the prefect of the praetorian guard gaius nymphidius sabinus also abandoned his allegiance to the emperor and came out in support of galba.nin response nero fled rome with the intention of going to the port of ostia and from there to take a fleet to one of the still-loyal eastern provinces according to suetonius nero abandoned the idea when some army officers openly refused to obey his commands responding with a line from virgils aeneid is it so dreadful a thing then to die nero then toyed with the idea of fleeing to parthia throwing himself upon the mercy of galba or appealing to the people and begging them to pardon him for his past offences and if he could not soften their hearts to entreat them at least to allow him the prefecture of egypt suetonius reports that the text of this speech was later found in neros writing desk but that he dared not give it from fear of being torn to pieces before he could reach the forum.nnero returned to rome and spent the evening in the palace after sleeping he awoke at about midnight to find the palace guard had left dispatching messages to his friends palace chambers for them to come he received no answers upon going to their chambers personally he found them all abandoned when he called for a gladiator or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him no one appeared he cried have i neither friend nor foe and ran out as if to throw himself into the tiber.nreturning nero sought a place where he could hide and collect his thoughts an imperial freedman phaon offered his villa located four miles outside the city travelling in disguise nero and four loyal freedmen epaphroditos phaon neophytus and sporus reached the villa where nero ordered them to dig a grave for him.nat this time a courier arrived with a report that the senate had declared nero a public enemy and that it was their intention to execute him by beating him to death and that armed men had been sent to apprehend him for the act to take place in the forum the senate actually was still reluctant and deliberating on the right course of action as nero was the last member of the julio-claudian family indeed most of the senators had served the imperial family all their lives and felt a sense of loyalty to the deified bloodline if not to nero himself the men actually had the goal of returning nero back to the senate where the senate hoped to work out a compromise with the rebelling governors that would preserve neros life so that at least a future heir to the dynasty could be produced.nnero however did not know this and at the news brought by the courier he prepared himself for suicide pacing up and down muttering qualis artifex pereo what an artist dies in me losing his nerve he begged one of his companions to set an example by killing himself first at last the sound of approaching horsemen drove nero to face the end however he still could not bring himself to take his own life but instead he forced his private secretary epaphroditos to perform the task.nn

octavia and was buried in the mausoleum of the domitii ahenobarbi in what is now the villa borghese pincian hill area of rome.nwith his death the julio-claudian dynasty ended when news of his death reached rome the senate posthumously declared nero a public enemy to appease the coming galba as the senate had initially declared galba as a public enemy and proclaimed galba the new emperor chaos would ensue in the year of the four emperors.nnafter neroeditnsee also nero redivivus legend and pseudo-neron apotheosis of nero c after 68 artwork portraying nero rising to divine status after his death.naccording to suetonius and cassius dio the people of rome celebrated the death of nero tacitus though describes a more complicated political environment tacitus mentions that neros death was welcomed by senators nobility and the upper class the lower-class slaves frequenters of the arena and the theater and those who were supported by the famous excesses of nero on the other hand were upset with the news members of the military were said to have mixed feelings as they had allegiance to nero but had been bribed to overthrow him.neastern sources namely philostratus ii and apollonius of tyana mention that neros death was mourned as he restored the liberties of hellas with a wisdom and moderation quite alien to his character and that he held our liberties in his hand and respected them."nmodern scholarship generally holds that while the senate and more well-off individuals welcomed neros death the general populace was loyal to the end and beyond for otho and vitellius both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia."nneros name was erased from some monuments in what edward champlin regards as an outburst of private zeal many portraits of nero were reworked to represent other figures according to eric r varner over fifty such images survive this reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously see damnatio memoriae champlin however doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of nero long after his death.nthe civil war during the year of the four emperors was described by ancient historians as a troubling period according to tacitus this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline as nero and those before him could galba began his short reign with the execution of many of neros allies one such notable enemy included nymphidius sabinus who claimed to be the son of emperor caligula.notho overthrew galba otho was said to be liked by many soldiers because he had been a friend of neros and resembled him somewhat in temperament it was said that the common roman hailed otho as nero himself otho used nero as a surname and reerected many statues to nero vitellius overthrew otho vitellius began his reign with a large funeral for nero complete with songs written by nero.nafter neros suicide in 68 there was a widespread belief especially in the eastern provinces that he was not dead and somehow would return this belief came to be known as the nero redivivus legend.nthe legend of neros return lasted for hundreds of years after neros death augustine of hippo wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422.nat least three nero imposters emerged leading rebellions the first who sang and played the cithara or lyre and whose face was similar to that of the dead emperor appeared in 69 during the reign of vitellius after persuading some to recognize him he was captured and executed sometime during the reign of titus 7981 another impostor appeared in asia and sang to the accompaniment of the lyre and looked like nero but he too was killed twenty years after neros death during the reign of domitian there was a third pretender he was supported by the parthians who only reluctantly gave him up and the matter almost came to war.nnmilitary conflictseditnboudiccas uprisingeditnin britannia in 59 ad prasutagus leader of the iceni tribe and a client king of romes during claudius reign died the client state

replace paulinus who continued to punish the population even after the rebellion was over.nnero decided to adopt a more lenient approach to governing the province and appointed a new governor petronius turpilianus.nnpeace with parthiaeditnfurther information romanparthian war of 5863nnero began preparing for war in the early years of his reign after the parthian king vologeses set his brother tiridates on the armenian throne around 57 ad and 58 ad domitius corbulo and his legions advanced on tiridates and captured the armenian capital artaxata tigranes was chosen to replace tiridates on the armenian throne when tigranes attacked adiabene nero had to send further legions to defend armenia and syria from parthia.nthe roman victory came at a time when the parthians were troubled by revolts when this was dealt with they were able to devote resources to the armenian situation a roman army under paetus surrendered under humiliating circumstances and though both roman and parthian forces withdrew from armenia it was under parthian control the triumphal arch for corbulos earlier victory was part-built when parthian envoys arrived in 63 ad to discuss treaties ngiven imperium over the eastern regions corbulo organised his forces for an invasion but was met by this parthian delegation an agreement was thereafter reached with the parthians rome would recognize tiridates as king of armenia only if he agreed to receive his diadem from nero a coronation ceremony was held in italy 66 ad dio reports that tiridates said i have come to you my god worshiping you as mithras shotter says this parallels other divine designations that were commonly applied to nero in the east including the new apollo and the new sun after the coronation friendly relations were established between rome and the eastern kingdoms of parthia and armenia artaxata was temporarily renamed neroneia.nnthe first jewish wareditnmain article first jewish-roman warnin 66 there was a

type of lyre many of these disciplines were standard education for the roman elite but neros devotion to music exceeded what was socially acceptable for a roman of his class ancient sources were critical of neros emphasis on the arts chariot-racing and athletics pliny described nero as an actor-emperor scaenici imperatoris and suetonius wrote that he was carried away by a craze for popularity...since he was acclaimed as the equal of apollo in music and of the sun in driving a chariot he had planned to emulate the exploits of hercules as well."nin 67 ad nero participated in the olympics he had bribed organizers to postpone the games for a year so he could participate and artistic competitions were added to the athletic events nero won every contest in which he was a competitor during the games nero sang and played his lyre on stage acted in tragedies and raced chariots he won a 10-horse chariot race despite being thrown from the chariot and leaving the race he was crowned on the basis that he would have won if he had completed the race after he died a year later his name was removed from the list of winners champlin writes that though neros participation effectively stifled true competition nero seems to have been oblivious of reality."nnero established the neronian games in 60 ad modeled on greek style games these games included music gymnastic and questrian contents according to suetonius the gymnastic contests were held in the saepta area of the campus martius.nnhistoriographyeditnthe history of neros reign is problematic in that no historical sources survived that were contemporary with nero these first histories while they still existed were described as biased and fantastical either overly critical or praising of nero the original sources were also said to contradict on a number of events nonetheless these lost primary sources were the basis of surviving secondary and tertiary histories on nero written by the next generations of historians a few of the contemporary historians are known by name fabius rusticus cluvius rufus and pliny the elder all wrote condemning histories on nero that are now lost there were also pro-nero histories but it is unknown who wrote them or for what deeds nero was praised.nthe bulk of what is known of nero comes from tacitus suetonius and cassius dio who were all of the senatorial class tacitus and suetonius wrote their histories on nero over fifty years after his death while cassius dio wrote his history over 150 years after neros death these sources contradict one another on a number of events in neros life including the death of claudius the death of agrippina and the roman fire of 64 but they are consistent in their condemnation of nero.na handful of other sources also

against him with their lies that they justly deserve to be condemned nor do i wonder at such as have told lies of nero since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those
